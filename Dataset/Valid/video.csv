day after that its sunday the day after that is monday what are you thanking god its friday for because youre preparing to quit youre preparing to stop what youre doing you prepared the clock out youre prepared to go home and you in the mental mindset could do nothing i dare you to get prepared for the challenges of your life by by getting rid of comfort i dare you i identity when you find that job that fit if you dont have a right to work that you want and then when you get there you take the stairs i dare you not to check your brain baby i dare you to work through your lunch i dare

from your addiction i dare you to stop running from the old youll become a man you know you cannot get what you want in your life youre not being comfortable comfort is failing us many of you are denied your dream and your goal because you have a consistency versus an intensity problem consistency is when you do something intensity is how you do something and thats why many of you no matter what you do no matter how much you do it no matter who youre looking at no matter what you read you gonna be denied because you think that just being consistent at something is gonna let you win and just that earns you the right to win that im being denied that corner office im being denied that card being denied this quality of life im being denied that opportunity scholarship i keep getting cut on off the team you know if i just stay if i just keep practicing i just stay around this team sooner or later ill make it no you wont no you wont because consistency does not guarantee you the win many of you is as bad as you dont want to accept this youre never going to win because youre not intense enough and until you get intense to the point that nothing nothing will get in your way that you will not get in your way you will never win its time to get real its time to get raw its time to look ourselves in the mirror and come to the resolve that this version of ourself is not going to carry us in the stretch music ive been this version of myself long enough that if i dont change if i dont do something about this then im gonna find myself bankrupt for me to understand for me to be better for me to be stronger i must learn to suffer a little bit i must learn to struggle a little bit i cannot reap the rewards of success without understanding about struggles success is not automatic you dont get things just because you want them you achieve your goals only when you are disciplined enough to keep showing up when you dont feel like it youre gonna put the blood youre gonna put the sweat youre gonna put the tears in youre gonna lose sleep youre going to go days without eating youre going to do whatever it takes to make the sacrifices necessary to man their best there are too many people in your life who have left you there are too many people in your life who have counted you out there are too many people in your life who have whispered in your ear and said youll be worse off without them prove them wrong son youre just a dreamer music that thing youre dreaming is never gonna happen music i would ask myself every single day are you just a dreamer are you a person who can grind until they execute somebody who can make that dream a reality is that you get clear on what you want in life and you do that by starting with the way you want to feel how do you want to feel every single day when you get up every day that i get up i want to be on fire i want to do the things that im passionate about i want to write i want to speak i want to create i want to get in front of people and change lives this is what i want to do every single day of my life i wanted somebody to look at me and say i believe in you but thats the way its always been in my life see when you dream big its like you speak a different language the common man the average person will not understand a person who is dreaming on the next level i know im talking to somebody out there right now who can relate to what im saying you got dreams you got ambitions that ninetofive job is just not enough for you you got this grand goal of conquering the world but no one around you believes you listen to me champion dont get discouraged by that you see the common man the average person they can only see with their eyes but the greats the legends the difference makers the ones that have rocked and shake this globe they sung with their minds that should have been mine it dont take faith to dream small you see the world belongs to the bold and the rest of the spectators what do you want your legacy here on earth to be when you are dead and gone what do you want people to say about you dont be scared to dream big youre probably thinking that this aint got nothing to do with me its got everything to do with you because maybe you got the right things happening right now for you but to your right that guy over there he aint living so well but youre learning something because if the tables were turned could you deal with it could you handle that stress could you handle that poverty how long have you been homeless how long have you been hungry how long have you not had clothes on your back how long have you been out of a job does your family walk out on you did your father walk out on you did your mother walk out on you are you going through a bad relationship have you lost your way this is what youre learning right now sometimes we all got to learn the hard way how many times as a child you heard your mother and father tell you not to do something but you did it anyway and you had to learn the hard way it wasnt the fact that you got disciplined perhaps by your parents but the world disciplines you more thats what makes it beautiful the hard times sometimes can be the best times why because youre gonna build up something youre gonna build up that grit youre gonna build up that tenacity youre gonna have a better understanding but you got to know what direction youre going and sometimes you may not even know sometimes people hate to be wrong because they feel that theyre always right sometimes you got to learn how to listen and not always speak out and thinking that you know so much because youre going to learn the hard way that youre just not that smart you dont have all the answers but just people walk outside your door driving your vehicle up and down the road you will see how much you can really learn just from people and some people are going through some significant problems right now more difficult than you could ever imagine you think you got it tough you have no idea what that other person got going on this is how we learn this is how we grow this is how we build yes youre gonna go through those challenges yes youre gonna go through some tough times in your life but like i always say when it gets tough you get tough kill the excuses kill the weakness and learn something about yourself learn that youre not that great but youre great enough to learn something new every day and you must learn to humble yourself yes there are people in the world that will literally glorify themselves as if they were god almighty himself but you got to understand you didnt make the world you were born in it and eventually you will die in it but when youre walking this earth when youre living in this world understand that youre learning because youre living maybe i just dont have all the answers maybe you should change a little bit maybe you need to understand that everything is not going to always go the way you think it should go if the world was so perfect we wouldnt be in the position that we are in right now but it is not the world fault its the people that are living in it and you my friend are a part of it i am a part of it and the decisions that we make the way we think of ourselves the way we think of our brothers and sisters will be the true outcome of where we are as a people so maybe all of these bad things that we are experiencing in our lives is because it must happen but we are learning believe me we are learning but were growing maybe some people dont realize the importance of hardship maybe some people dont realize that its okay to go through those hard times thats what youre learning right now this is whats going to help you to understand what type of a difference you can make as an individual as a human being as a mother as a father what do you do how can you continue on your life not realizing that we are all learning music so yes maybe you think youre awesome theres nothing wrong with confidence theres nothing wrong with believing in yourself so when i say it again i said with conviction none of us are that great we are searching for greatness and thats a long long long long long journey but we can do it together instead of tearing down lets build up dont tear it down build it up build the bridge cross the bridge with me let me cross the bridge with you lets learn together through the good and the bad the hard times are gonna come but were gonna stand were gonna fight were gonna push were gonna work were gonna give it everything we got because here we are right now in this world do we fall down and stay down or do we lift each other up and carry on that is what we do this is who we are we are all students of life if youre breathing youre learning if youre learning youre living so carry on the good fight my beautiful people stay productive stay strong keep it moving and from the bottom of my heart conduct your business youve gotten this far if you was gonna quit you should have quit a long time ago youve come too far to quit now you need to get a reward for it thats why im trying to tell you never stop never give up never give in your boy was a high school dropout your boy was homeless are you hearing what im saying i slept in the buildings baby you say how did you get here e cause one day i got up and stopped being a victim and i was a victor are you hearing me and i took that one class and that one class turned into two classes and i got my ged and then i went to college and yep i told you it took 12 years but what did i do i never stopped fighting it got harder and it got harder and it seemed the further i climbed the harder it got but i didnt stop i didnt quit i just kept fighting and fighting and then i got to the masters and it was harder than the four year and it was harder than the ged but what did i do i got here not because im the strongest not because im the fastest not because im the best but i kept fighting and fighting and fighting your boy got through the masters now were at the end of the phd baby oh you not hear what im saying now we got the dissertation and i aint no writer and i aint no intelligent dude and i aint no scholar then you say how you gonna get the phd because i keep fighting and fighting and fighting and fighting and fighting and fighting and what i what i will not do is i will not quit and when that thing tells you to quit you look at it in his eye and say i aint going nowhere i will break you before you break me you will not defeat me you will not destroy me lay hold of it some of you are so ignorant youve been through so much hell you wont quit now you shouldnt quit 10 years ago when you got raped you shouldve quit 10 years ago when he walked out on you you should have been quit you dont quit now its the 10th round you got too more to go and when you get to success its not about steel when you get to a certain level of yourself its about that its about stamina its about you wont break me you cant take me i fought too long i fought too hard if i was going quickly you should have got me a 17 home you should have scored me when i was leaning out faster its too late now im in the rich coffin its too late now cause i keep fighting and fighting and fighting and fighting its too late i got peoples lives i think its too late you should have broke me a long time ago im unbreakable now if you could take this one principle that hw gave me it it revolutionized my life its about to revolutionize your life if you would just embrace it michael jordan started his career started by somebody telling him no that theres no way youre not good enough to play basketball you hear me in high school he was told you cant play on this team youre not good enough guess what he did he kept fighting and fighting and fighting and fighting and even when he wasnt on the team he was still fight and fight when he got cut he never stopped fighting and fighting and he came back the next year made it on varsity went to north carolina cant listen to me wasnt even the first round trap sam fool yall dont even know who that is right sam bowie so he went from all of that adversity he kept fighting and fighting he didnt win first year he didnt win second year he didnt win third year he didnt win fourth year he didnt win a championship fifth year he didnt win one sixth year it wasnt after seven years that he won his first title guess what he did he kept fighting and fighting and fighting and when i told my man hw listen to me these brothers have shown me that nothing is impossible he said et you got it twisted its as possible are you hearing what im saying revolutionized my life he said his past possible see this is the thing you gotta understand when somebody say impossible nothing you still talk about two double negatives you talk about a negative here nothing negative here impossible he said you got it twisted here its not impossible its not that nothing is impossible its past possible meaning that theres no way you cant do it oh youre not hearing me and when he said that it changed my thought process because im gonna keep it real with you its past possible oh do not hear me its past possible meaning that not only can you do it ah youre gonna go way beyond that it means that the probability of you doing it is greater than you not doing it youre not here what im saying when you say its past possible that here not only will you do it but the odds are in your favor thats a whole nother level its past possible meaning that theres nothing you can do that the odds are for you and not against you so youre going to get that phd so you go get that masters so you go back to school are you hearing what im saying are you hearing what im telling you its past possible meaning that all you got to do is start because if its past possible as soon as you start you know youre going to set records you know youre going to take it to the next level you know whats going to be that youre going to do whats never been done before so i challenge you as past possible if youre gonna win the fight of your life you cant be afraid to fight music ive come to learn that theres a huge difference between failing and failure failing is like stubbing your toe you know it happens its its a its a verb you know its just something you do but failure is a noun its an identity its a place of where you stay and i failed a lot a lot a lot along the way but i was never a failure because i kept trying i kept doing it i understood over time that my value wasnt representative of the things that worked or didnt work it was so frustrating because i was chasing an idea of value not understanding that i was valued to begin with music a crumpled up 20 bill is still 20 it doesnt lose its value when its beaten up you have a right to what youre feeling but just because you feel it doesnt mean its real im going to acknowledge that i dont like this but im also going to acknowledge that i dont want to stay in this feeling because if i already have to go through this diabetes i already have to go through being different i already have to go through feeling like a monster i dont have to beat myself up in my own head if you get a flat tire on the side of the road you dont set your car on fire you deal with the flat tire but thats what i felt like i was doing and a lot of people do a lot of people set the car on fire instead of addressing the main issue they build upon it and make it worse how can i become more than whats happened to me how can i become more than the circumstance that i hate but how can i not let that hate towards the circumstance i cant control control me control me you know sometimes we get addicted to this like making everything beautiful making everything like amazing and sometimes we have to be real some situations do suck they do and we have to allow them to suck and not invalidate the fact that it does suck my job is to not let my mind take over and thats when i win and when i lose and everything in between music you have a choice between what you think and what you do and that choice is everything music music music music you

for the court now that roe v wade has been overturned could other rights also be at risk  also who gets to  give the new efforts to change a controversial policy preventing one  group from donating  blood p from d  we are back with our continuing coverage of the  supreme courts ruling on abortion and the  question of whether  other rights not specifically mentioned in the constitution like gay marriage should also be at  risk nbc justice  correspondent pete williams reports  reporter the supreme courts  fivemember majority said 50 years of abortion ruling  starting with roe  should be overturned because the right to abortion is  not deeply rooted in  this nations history  and tradition so does that mean other rights recognized by the  court including samesex marriage and  access to birth  control are also in trouble since theyre not deeply rooted in history either justice clarence thomas said the  courts rulings on contraceptives and gay marriage should be reexamined but justice samuel alito  who wrote the opinion  striking down roe repeatedly said no he said abortion is  different because it ends a potential  life some conservative  legal experts say  those other precedents are safe because samesex marriage has  a counterpart oppositesex marriage thats protected but  abortion does not  ask me again in 50  years about this but  i think theres going  to be a lot of hesitation on the  court to strike down these other rights  reporter theres another factor the roe ruling was the product of a well organized  and sustained campaign to overturn it by contrast the supreme court  recognized the right to samesex marriage seven years ago and no such nationwide  movement has formed to oppose it even so theres nothing to prevent a future court from  striking down those  other rights for having no roots in history  we now know that a  majority of the  supreme court wouldnt have recognized them in the first place as to whether they would now reject them the key point is that  theyve only been  around recognized by  the supreme court for five 10 15 years  which makes them much  easier to overrule  reporter one of  the courts  conservatives brett kavanaugh said  fridays ruling does not threaten those other precedents so justice thomas seems to be alone in questioning them at least for now jose  pete williams in  washington thank you  still ahead the new efforts to change  a controversial blood  donor policy  and the surprising way strangers turned up to help a neighbor  now to the battle  over blood donations as the nation faces a  critical shortage a decadesold  controversy is being reignited over a group of people who are not  allowed to donate  reporter joe fryer nbc news washington  and when we come back does it seem like your yard work is never done wait until you see what a group of total  strangers did for  their new neighbor  see what ♪  theres good news  tonight about loving thy neighbor and the family that went above and beyond to lend a hand to their new  neighbors  when blake and  madison moved their  young family to north  carolina this spring  they were excited to spruce up their  property so they bought a  small affordable  mower to get everything shipshape  but it was no match  for nearly an acre of  overgrown land there you see blake with his baby girl  nora in a carrier on  his back pushing a  mower but barely  making a dent  i realized it was going to be quite a  task once i got  started  madison was inside  watching their son  dane but when she looked outside what she saw moved her to tears  people are so good just got out of the  shower peeked out the window to see if blake had made any progress figuring hed have five hours left and i  see this  look a whole group arrived to help total strangers had  seen blake struggling  and rushed to his  rescue  they just showed up randomly not  expecting anything from us just  completely out of the  kindness of their  hearts  turns out those strangers were

family and striking a chord on  social media too the video viewed more than 20 million times  pretty incredible  and it makes us want to be the same way and do the same thing for  our neighbors  the two families  guided by their faith now friends thanks to  a small but  significant show of  support its a lesson in kindness they say  theyll be passing down to their own  kids  you might think that

9i4SKHbhbqk,the best fast food recipes  part one  gordon ramsay,Food,cant beat properly homecooked popcorn start off with just a touch of oil in there as it lightly starts to smoke corn in so now get your lid never leave it far away from you sounds like its raining its not so its popcorn canals trying to pop out boom delicious just a little shake of the pan get it going and then lift that lid at your apparel we see its a very exciting pan in there and when all that little pitter patter stops you know your popcorn is cooked nice you could eat it fresh from the pan but ive got another plan im gonna make a salted caramel popcorn start off with your sugar into the hot pan never stir a caramel otherwise it crystallizes its a salted caramel so a nice pinch of salt in there as well now once youve got it to a really nice dark caramel flavor stir in your butter very carefully caramel is very very hot half a teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda kickstarts the reaction that gives the caramel a honeycomb flavor mix that in youll see it reacting almost like a large crunchy in the bottom of your bowl now the gas is off and that camera has a nice dark rich flavor now pour in the popcorn to coat it with that incredible caramel give that a good mix its that easy and its gonna taste amazing lay that nice and flat once that cools down it becomes nice and brittle weve got that nice salted caramel flavor which just takes popcorn to a complete dim level whilst the popcorn cools down its onto my prawn tostada wonderful prawns im gonna marinate them first with a little bit of garlic nice and fine and dont worry if you cant slice thinly just get a little crater and grate the garlic nice and fine as well nice pinch of chili flakes over your prawn garlic in salt pepper and olive oil give that a really nice little mix whilst the prawns marinade im gonna knock up a salad this is a really nice sort of light fragrant salad radishes topped and tailed and then into quarters cherry tomatoes halved spring onions sliced and seasoned and then just to liven things up a little bit of chili in there and slice them on an angle now the avocado cut in half give that a little twist so you just go down and down and down carefully with your knife turn it around go down and down and down and then you take your spoon and youve got your diced avocado coming out already now baby gem lettuce half then shred freshly squeezed lime juice and a little drizzle of olive oil tostada is a classic mexican style open tortilla so that lime complements it beautifully lastly roughly chopped coriander and give it a mix that is the perfect base for our tostada the salads ready now for the prawns and dont be afraid of getting the pan nice and hot teaspoon of olive oil in anything less than that sizzle when you put that first prawn in there dont put them in keep them nice and flat make sure youve got all that marinade in there as well watch them change color rapidly id rather cook them quicker in a hotter pan and slower in a colder pan the difference in taste is night and day the prawns will take just two minutes to cook through lime juice just over the top nice toss them over the lime these are corn tortilla quite robust and its a kind of base that doesnt disintegrate hot pan in its a dry pan so that corn tortilla goes nice and crispy on the outside music look crispy shell to build them generous with the salad that base will stay nice and crisp next with your prawns i like to keep the tails in to the center and lay the round part of the prawn on the outside and there we have a delicious yeah very humble prawn tostada followed by my superb salty caramel popcorn beautiful music prawn tostadas and salty caramel popcorn vibrant irresistible smelling dishes youll want to dive into big and bold i was living in france i stayed there for three years once twice a week i treated myself to the most amazing bold breakfast and it started off with these beauties here murgays cheap but incredibly tasty start off with a nice hot pan mug is in its a very spicy sausage doesnt need any help doesnt even need chili just a touch of salt and pepper you can smell the spice theyre starting to release all that wonderful oil that flavor in there add a couple of cloves ill finely slice garlic spread the garlic across the pan it instantly changes color takes on this nice dark rich golden color now take a look with the heat out with the parsley the stalks of soft herbs like parsley and coriander can be used to impart flavour during cooking but the leaves should always be added just before serving to give maximum colour and fragrance music and then finish that off with my capers amazing all right beautiful now take your quests on theyre literally 24 hours old so theyre crispy on the outside and just slice off the lid this recipe is a great way to use up any leftover croissants from the day before i used to cringe when i saw the french cooks throw away croissants i used to cry thinking oh my god any idea what youre throwing away in terms of flavor whatever you do do not wipe out that pan dunk your croissants mopping up all that amazing flavor and caramelizing the inside for that beautiful and dont forget the lids and then get your thumbs and go inside the croissant all i want to do now is just create a little pocket and just manipulate the crescent now this is where it gets exciting mix up the capers the garlic and sausages look at the color of that wonderful delicious flavored oil now some cheese but not just any cheese fontina cheese is like the number one cheese for grilling and because its a very rich cheese you shave it thinner than you would a white truffle but it gives a really nice saltiness and a light smoky flavour salt place these big boys on the tray literally 30 seconds on the grill here we go nice crisp packed full of flavor now top them and that for me its almost like being back in paris except this time i dont have to share them with the french my ultimate big and bold breakfast murgies and fontina stuffed croissants a great way to start the day music jack hi my gonna help with some pickling please oh definitely no you love pickles right love pickles um favorite pickle what is it i like pickled onions were going to do pickled celery mmhmm its a nice little snack and great for plum ones great for salads first thing we need to pick the celery for me so you see where the next ones going to be its in there yeah okay ill figure it out but im hungry today is this all were having for dinner jack come on i wouldnt do that to you you know that theres more coming now because were pickling it we want to sort of make it look a little bit more attractive so we go around like that okay on an angle so when you pick all the food does it does it preserve it its exactly what it does but also gives it a really nice salty soury flavour yeah okay now splash of water and then with the sugar nice okay so gotta bring that up to the bowl and sort of create almost like a little syrup yeah okay little teaspoon of peppercorns in mustard seeds in quite generous on the mustard seeds that gives a bit of sort of spice now those you must know cloves excellent cloves in now touch of salt no okay so from there white wine vinegar now in order for all that to actually pickle you need to boil it so by boiling it okay it brings all the ingredients together it fuses all the spices and helps cook the celery have a little taste nice nice see i put some hairs on your chest yes it will look boom its working already now see nice wine vinegar right celerys ready yeah okay lets walk to the ball now turn that off now from there start placing the celery into that jar so when you pick other foods can you use that same recipe exactly that 100 once its pickled it doesnt really go off mmhmm okay now put them in there so can we eat this straight away when its in here do you know what as soon as its cooled down you can definitely eat that straight away i cant wait to dig into it at dinner are they delicious yes well leave that to cool down our pickles are ready and cooling now to marinate the chicken when you fried chicken traditionally its always gonna be done with the dark meat the brown meat so youve got that nice sort of uh drum here and this bit that thigh cooking on the bone as well keeps it even more moist so first things first salt pepper please from there famous buttermilk buttermilk in its brilliant for marinating the chicken if you can put this buttermilk over your chicken the night before the more it tenderizes the chicken and starts to sort of really relax the chicken and puts a really nice sort of creamy soury flavor in there so might stick that in the fridge for us please and well start the dolce de leche biscuits nice the argentinians call these shortbreads alfa jorge and theyre the favorite sweet treat on the streets of buenos aires theyre light crumbly shortbread biscuits sandwiched with gloriously golden caramel dolce de leche sauce for the shortbread beat together softened butter granulated sugar and beat until light and fluffy add one egg music slice vanilla pots scrape out the seeds add to the mix and beat again plain flour corn flour and baking powder then fold the mixture together using floured hands roll into small balls flatten into discs and place on a baking tray music chill for 10 minutes until firm to touch then simply bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until pale golden once cooled sandwich two biscuits together with a caramelly dolce de leche sauce music finish with a dusting of icing sugar music delicious my dessert and pickles are ready the buttermilk should have worked its magic on the chicken all thats left is to fry it now were gonna roll the chicken out of the buttermilk into the flour so thats why it gets nice and crispy and blistery on the outside okay cool so what weve got to make sure because the flour is the last coat yes this is nicely seasoned yeah okay so salt and pepper in there nice and this is smoked paprika so that gives it a little bit of sort of uh maybelline yeah yeah spice thats right a little bit of heat and this one my favorites whats that cayenne pepper thats right again slightly spicy but the heat works brilliantly well garlic powder traditionally are used a lot in the steaks onion powder garlic powder just run your fingers through that please cool im gonna get the pan on now two centimetres of oil this is a really good mix for fish as well mmhmm goujons fighting a nice spicy texture helps fish so first thing is we just shake off some of the buttermilk lay that down yes okay really important to get them covered completely okay in the flour yeah okay so i love fried chicken do you now lift that up there first one and you place it in there away from you off you go nice and gently good and lay away good if any stage you think the oil is getting too hot yeah just add a touch of cold oil in there or turn off the gas good gently fry the chicken for 25 to 30 minutes or until cooked through now very carefully turn them over please yeah cool can we have this every day jack fried chicken every day no definitely not its a treat and its shallow fried so once every three weeks yeah sounds great to me yeah now off with the gas okay yeah paper ready okay onto the paper sell them i love fried chicken im telling you im pretty sure i love it morning look heres the best bit delicious now fried chicken pickles if you pick up um dolce de leche cakes we are ready bud very nice thats good delicious uncle mummy wow tilly phoebe rum divine dolce de leche biscuits my pickled celery and buttermilk fried chicken a soulful street food feast if there ever was one

oipOWHbRs6g,50 budget tech you need  mid 2022,Tech,hey guys its carl welcome back to another budget tech episode this is the first of the summer in 2022 im actually going to wwdc tomorrow or by the time this video is live so a lot of this stuff will focus on maybe some of those accessories because its impossible to get an item under 50 from apple but the best part you can win one of the items from today im still dealing with a lot of the spam of youtube but just leave a comment but more importantly follow me over on social instagram as thats where i usually dm the people and one of these items is on the way well get to the first one which you can kind of see off to here its obviously not a new phone these are the new 13 13 pro in the new green colorways but the first thing that i do for every single phone not just iphones that i get is stick this on which you cant probably see right here but it is a screen protector i am someone that always rocks my phones naked probably because i get a ton and i just feel like they have a nicer feel in the hand especially the 13 pro 13 pro max the stainless steel banding around the outside it feels so premium it feels nice but screens have become so prone to scratches apple in particular has something called ceramic shield which makes their glass less prone to shattering when you drop it but its actually more prone to scratching because the actual glass is softer so every time i just go over to my friends at dbrand i get one of their screen protectors these ones are super easy to apply they come with multiple in the pack they even have this cool little squeegee tool you essentially just line up the glass and the stickers to a new iphone apply it and just squeegee your phone out to get rid of any bubbles and thats why i do prefer flatter edge screens i know the s22 ultra even the pixel 6 pro has that slightly curved screen you can never get to the end with a screen protector but i guess thats the price you pay for curved glass keep your phones protected even my older 13 pro max this one in sierra blue the screen is still like new even though the rest of the phone has a lot of dings and scratches but if we do see a low key announcement of a new iphone i dont think we will at dub dub dc make sure you stay protected speaking of green iphones and in particular i think a lot of other brands have come out with green phones this year some other green accessories that you can grab from apple you can of course grab a silicon case or these green smart wallets or the apple wallets these ones just snap onto the back with magsafe and the new generation ones you can actually add those to the find my app so in case you misplace this somewhere leave it at home at a store you can always find them on a map so thats kind of nice its pretty much like a builtin air tag around 50 bucks once again it is pretty tough finding accessories and what they actually do really really well is their refresh of accessories theyre essentially the same thing they just come out in different color ways so this is a new sport watch band i grabbed this one in their newest colorway this is in particular northern blue which is right now replacing this current blue one so i do have the apple watch series seven once again i dont think were gonna get any new product in the iphone or apple watch space usually we just get software updates but since it is summer new apple watch band thats looking pretty nice and like i said i gotta give huge shout outs to apple for consistently making me spend more money on new bands and i love the fact that you can just swap these out really easily so well just take this switch that on and we will quickly slap that on the wrist thats looking pretty fresh the blue on blue with the series 7 in the blue aluminum i did get apple and once again spending money under 50 bucks but its always nice to swap out your accessories onto this cool little package that nintendo and actually pokemon sent me i think to do with their new games coming out in november scarlett and violet a lot of people are saying that its going to be the best game a lot of open worldness nick is a big fan its gonna be like an open world zelda meets pokemon breath of the wild times pokemon i dont think to the scale of breath of the wild but bigger than anything weve seen before you heard it here first bigger than anything weve seen if there are any big pokemon fans im still an og pokemon guy and i mean that by saying just the original 150 i kind of lost track uh after theyve come out with that how many pokemon are they nick uh almost a thousand well a little over a thousand if you include all the different forms too many too many to remember but these are a pretty cool pair of headphones from grado when i did look online these were over 50 bucks but i do know that prime day is coming up so if you can snag these for 50 especially if they still come out with these limited edition pokemon ones so you can see the little pokeball and pokemon center times grado labs that looks pretty fresh if youre a big pokemon fan and want to rock some headphones thats pretty dope speaking of gaming under 50 bucks or around that 50 mark the new star wars lego game you can snag that for 49 right now so i am rocking that a lot on my switch its just kind of fun to relive im a big lego fan if you cant tell ive just got star wars lego everywhere so its fun to kind of play through the series again a lot of nice like dialogue its cute its fun and something that ill be playing probably on the plane over to wwdc one thing that i have upgraded actually from my switch even though i still have the og my memory card slot at the bottom has been filling up so i just got this new one terabyte card this one in particular is from lexar so i actually just got a couple so i can just kind of swap them out continuously on my switch and any phones that do still support micro sd cards like the new sony phone which i just reviewed one of my favorites i still popped one of these in sadly i dont think well ever see micro sd card support on an apple device but one can always dream speaking of sd cards one thing that well be shooting with at wwc for all of the content that you guys will see on the channel we have upgraded all of our sd cards on our main cam so recording a7 s3s and an a74 a lot of camera gear that well be bringing because we just want to showcase whats uh kind of coming out apple is notorious for being really cryptic on what is actually being released i know that theres leaks theres rumors but even the day before or as this video goes live when were in cupertino at uh steve jobs theater i still do not know what is officially being launched so we just want to ensure we have a ton of storage for all our footage if theres anything that you guys want to see let me know uh in the comments and we will try to record it at all and finally going through the rest of our tech travel pack looking at all the gear well be taking most of the stuff is over 50 bucks but this caught my eye just kind of picked this up this is the lonzi key light so this is just a portable light were not too sure which shooting conditions well be shooting in in case we are somewhere that needs a bit more brightness or some light this as you can see boosts up and gives you some pretty decent and adequate light so this is around 5045 i believe if i remember ordering from amazon this is actually bicolor led so you can get from 2500 kelvin all the way up to 9000 you can decrease the brightness with this little toggle on the side and it does come with this little gel package which i like which gives you really really soft light obviously you can remove it and just have a bit more harshness so depending on the look that you want to get and in terms of battery life youre looking at 90 minutes on a full charge and thats at 100 and obviously as you dial it down to say 20 30 brightness you can get longer and whats nice usbc to charge so you dont need micro usb which is pretty antiquated its old and just nice to keep all of my accessories pretty pretty modern and this will just kind of pop into my bag and whats actually kind of cool which its not what its advertised for this gel gives it a bit of cushion just because we kind of toss around into our bag so its protected its safe and its just a little reliable piece of kit that weve added to the arsenal there are a couple other things that we got into the studio around that 50 mark so the first one is this new death outer v2 mouse technically isnt new but just because it has this cool halo colorway on it this one in particular it isnt 50 if you dont mind getting a nonhalo version you can snag that off amazon for 45 bucks i dont care what any people say about wireless mice just give me a good old wired mouse i know it doesnt look as clean but the performance on it you just cant beat a wired connection so the v2 is significantly lighter than obviously v1 this is 82 grams versus 105 youve got eight programmable buttons and you can map those to five different profiles its pretty much just a mouse that works out of the box and id rather grab a razor mouse versus one of those amazon knockoffs that are still around 20 30 bucks spend the 20 extra get a known brand and one that will work all the time and once again you can just stick this into a backpack its great to have as a second mouse or if youre just really into gaming and dont want to break the bank solid the next item were keeping it in the razer game were showing them a lot of love on this episode maybe because they released their barracuda pro headphones those cost 250 dollars not in this particular video but these are just simple controller stands the main function they actually charge your controllers whether thats ps5 or the xbox whatever your deathly choices or if youre even pc whatever you might jive with but these also come in different color options as well you can see weve just got the black on black but i know on the xbox side you have more color choices so these are just fun little ways to keep your controllers off the desk and youll never need to replace batteries im looking at you xbox controllers i know that playstation 5 controllers way superior theyre way better its how a controller should charge but for whatever reason we still see xbox on the double a batteries even though i just threw some shade at uxbox i still kind of love you guys and i am giving away a month of xbox game pass this is just a little brick that i pulled out from my little jenga block whoever snags this first let me know youve just got a month free game pass last off well finish off with a couple things i know im not really tech related but i am getting into golf a lot more this summer and its just kind of my new sport in general i know that golf is probably one of the most expensive sports maybe only that in formula one is probably more expensive but there are ways to keep things on budget the first one i am team taylormade they help out and send me all their stuff but these head covers should cost you less than 50 maybe not this orange one in particular theres ones that range between 20 to 45 dollars just something to keep your putter covered in when you think about it you could just probably use a sock to do the same thing but um had to just keep things all orange and even though i am sponsored by taylormade i die a bit inside because im so at golf when i shank a ball into the woods into the water those are like four dollar tp5s that uh i continuously lose my heart just cant bear it so i just bought this basic pack of balls i think this is 15 20 bucks these are just nitro balls i of course got them in orange once again i just dont care if i lose these if i shank them if i lose 10 of them in a round i wont die on the inside obviously they just dont have the same feel or as nice as a tp5 but for just something that im driving off of or im just shanking and losing just trying to keep things on budget and um making the game a bit more accessible and just cheaper in general hope you guys enjoy this episode like i said we are heading off to wwdc by the time youre watching this video we should already be in cupertino so if theres anything you want to get covered if there are any undercover leaks that you guys want to see let me know down below in the comments remember you can win something be sure to sub hopefully you guys enjoy this were just recovering or im particularly recovering from kobit as it hit me harder than i thought just getting content out is a bit of a slog but i hope you guys enjoy it thanks for bearing with me and well catch the rest of you in one of my next episodes peace

STgA3dYavBQ,my favorite tech of the month,Tech,whats going on guys its your average consumer and today were going to be checking out my favorite tech that ive been using for the past month now last time we had the entire team involved that was great a lot of you guys liked it i dont know if these guys will be able to keep up with one of these videos every month so you guys are stuck with me for a little bit theyll be back at some point but today were gonna find out some of the stuff that ive been using personally i got some stuff that ive really been enjoying but before we jump into that we gotta give a huge shout out to todays sponsor lark so check it out guys this is the lark pitcher pureviz now you might be looking at this and wondering what kind of tech can a water pitcher have well we all know about the typical filtration systems that water pitchers use well if you actually think about it those filtration systems remove pollutants from water but they also hold on to them and after about two weeks its recontaminating the water thats where the pureviz tech comes in on the lark pitcher its got two steps with filtration and purification using uvc led tech that purifies water by deactivating biocontaminants at the molecular level and whats cool is that the purification happens automatically so you dont have to think about actively cleaning it one of my biggest problem with pitchers that have filters was always the upkeep but with larks plantbased filter and pureviz tech staying on top of those contaminants you can go longer without needing to change anything and with this thing being a smart picture with tech inside of course it has an app where you can track things like water intake and then some so if you guys want to learn more about the lark pitcher and some of the cool tech that they offer ill of course have links down below in the description for you guys to check it out this thing will definitely make a great addition to our smart kitchen and of course if you guys want to check out lark ill have links down below in the description but now lets talk about some of the gear that ive been using personally this first one should be a nobrainer to a lot of you guys so what weve got right here are the sony wh1000x mark fives so these are obviously a nobrainer sony headphones are my favorite headphones i can i can confidently say that they make some of the best headphones out ive been rocking sonys for so many years on this channel of course you know this is the latest version they sound great the 1000x have always been the top of the line for their bluetooth headphones in terms of like great audio quality noise cancellation these have insane noise cancellation you guys i was able to travel with these and on the plane its usually a goal of mine to just block everything out and try and fall asleep before the plane takes off with this not an issue i threw it on immediately blocked out ahri and i was good to go im not gonna lie to you guys best noise cancellation that you can get in any bluetooth headphones right now these are amazing honestly what i love about sonys headphones is you pretty much get everything you need out of these they sound amazing these sound really good noise cancellation is great transparency mode that also works really well i still feel like apple has the best transparency mode out of any brand right now apple for some reason they they just got that down but i just feel like this checks all of the important boxes so ive been really enjoying these i do really wish that they could fold these are these are kind of like the air pods now like the airpods max where theyre just this like this one singular design i wish they didnt change that but for the most part its really really good now if you happen to have i dont know the mark threes and up i wouldnt run out and buy this because this is 400 bucks but if youre like new to the line and youre like i need a pair of really good bluetooth headphones with long battery life sound amazing best active noise cancelling i can get this is really really good and it has a ton i mean a ton of features with the headphones app that sony made really really crazy stuff i feel like this gives you everything you could possibly want out of a pair of bluetooth headphones youre paying for that though youre paying for that premium experience with this at 400 bucks absolutely worth checking out if you need a pair of premium bluetooth headphones now i feel like these were a nobrainer but i got some other cool stuff here jay remember this from the last its from the massive tech unboxing that never saw the light of day were not gonna talk were not gonna talk about that jay the lost episode but right here guys this thing is called the couch console so this is basically supposed to be i dont know like your best buddy when youre chilling on the couch and youre just playing games watching tv you might be wondering like judd what the heck is this thing what are we looking at right im not even sure what you call it but youve got like this tray of sorts you can have a drink right here and its got this like really cool design that no matter how this thing is oriented on the couch if you bump into it it should be able to keep your drink upright so you dont have to worry about spills can we get a cup i got to show you guys so you just throw it in here this obviously has a cover but you guys can see as you tilt it its staying upright the entire time it also has these other compartments so if you want to throw in i dont know like some chips or some kind of snack in here you can do that it even has like this little spacer its they call it the couch cushion spacer but you can use this thing as a lid so when youre not when youre done snacking or something you can just kind of throw that on top remove it yes you can just kind of enjoy yourself but heres one thing you might not have noticed you see its got a usb c port and thats because under this guy you actually have a spot for a portable charger or anything else that you want to keep nearby so this also acts as a storage compartment for your couch now i think this is really cool because obviously theres at least a little bit of tech involved here so if youve got that here maybe youve got your phone right here on the other side you can just plug in have your phone charging even maybe watch some content i dont know but youve got the ability to do that i think thats pretty dope and if youre not using this little thing to hold up a phone or something you can actually just flip it over completely pop it here and it becomes like a little arm rest for you its got like this nice soft material youre watching whatevers on your tv your drinks not spilling youre living large man this is this is really cool i i think this is awesome i got one in the man cave and i got one in my uh my bedroom gotta have it its its clutch now were gonna move on to something a little something thats very very new to me uh and thats actually in here lets see so weve got right here is this guy the paper tablet the remarkable two now you guys might have seen me just unbox this in the recent massive tech unboxing if you guys havent seen that video ill of course have it linked down below as well but you know i got made fun of of course you guys know me kind of old school still like to walk around with a pen old school day jay at my place of work oh fine i guess i dont got to have it but i thought i did for having a paper and pen on me at all times no jay im hurt you cant take it back now the ball just decide this is something that i probably should have had a long time ago i find myself buying that kind of stationary like notebooks and pens just so i could jot my ideas down i like getting a new one whenever i want i really want to get inspired and feel creative again and i dont have to do that anymore that is like just completely thats completely gone for me but with this you pretty much have access to a paper tablet it doesnt function like your typical ipad uh it doesnt have like a backlight it feels like paper so you can just write as you music please i like the idea of getting tech involved with something thats pretty old school like i miss being able to write things out i feel like im way more creative when im actually writing and it doesnt feel the same writing on something like an ipad whereas with this it does feel a bit more natural like youre really writing on paper uh its just a nicer experience and it fills the void of not having that notebook in here anymore whats also pretty cool is you can actually change up the way it looks so lets see what kind of layers do we want so youve got all kinds of different templates so whatever works best for you now this is not the fastest device in the world and it doesnt need to be it does what it has too quick enough you can go ahead and get that old school you know mead notebook feel you can do that with no problem you can have grids you guys saw theres a ton of different templates so you can pick what works best for what youre trying to accomplish in that moment but this has just been awesome its a pretty expensive tablet especially when you start throwing in some of the accessories the first party accessories i think amazon sells some like thirdparty accessories for far cheaper i should have gone that route but this has just been amazing like if you feel like youre the kind of person who needs to write things down and you want a nice place that keeps it all categorized and you know youve got your dates and times all of that stuff you can have it all organized within this so i am happy with this purchase um well see all credit to you jay now the last thing and this is just me sharing what ive been enjoying you guys cant say i recommend you go out and get something like this because its really expensive i know this uh but its the canon r5 so the r5 has been their best mirrorless camera for a while now how long ago did they release this jay was it just 20 20 july 2020 yes all right jay go ahead go ahead jay but yeah ive been loving this thing this camera is a beast when it comes to the specs its got it all youve got you can shoot an ak you can shoot really great 4k got slow motion i think you can do 4k 120 you can do all the things with this camera but the image quality that you get out of this has just been really awesome now for our youtube videos we use like the sony a7s uh mark threes absolutely love but this i feel like for a as a personal camera i just been really enjoying the style of canon canon has really great color science uh thats always just been their thing but im really liking what they did with the lenses the rf lenses i think are really dope not only are they really fast when it comes to autofocusing and really silent but theyve got like this extra ring right here that gives you control over your image so for me personally ive got this set to like my iso so i can just change my iso by turning the lens here so now this is way overexposed for me im taking lots of photos of my family doing some video stuff here and there taking photos of like tech products so for me its a hybrid camera where i needed to do everything thats a really good point jay so we actually took this over to hawaii when we were shooting something with uh i think snapdragon i used this to shoot which surprisingly it didnt overheat on me which is like a big concern like there was in the sun i was baking in the sun you see i i was probably sweating in that video but like with what jay said i didnt have to do much grading like the image right out of the camera was good enough to upload straight to youtube so thats one of the great things about canon but either way canon aint sponsoring this video so dont dont buy candy if you dont want i dont care im just saying what i like so that about wraps it up for this video guys hopefully you enjoyed it uh if you did you know what to do be the cool guy or girl that gives this video a thumbs up catch you guys in the next one how long should we wait till we bring the guys back i feel like twice a year jason forever you gotta go first next time again jay but either way well catch you guys in the next one till then its your average consumer peace check this out too guys this right here this little i cant believe i missed this ive been taking this thing everywhere i walk around all day strap ready to go this is this is this is so necessary this is from peak design if you havent seen these definitely look into it
gpYxTj2HBbI,book the hotel for istanbul klopp adamant liverpool will bounce back after champions league loss,Sport,jurgen its so close huge effort this season with so much success but must be heartbroken tonight yeah of course the moon and dressing room is obviously um nobody feels a great season in this moment i probably need a few minutes for that maybe hours but it was with an end the two decisions were against us were for the smallest margin possible so um thats it we a good game not a perfect game but it was obviously i dont think a perfect game would have been possible against the opponent how the setup was how they set it up with uh with the deep formation going for counterattacks going for the long balls these kind of things that was tricky uh that was actually the the situation where they became dangerous like with the disallowed goal in the first half which was one ball which we couldnt defend in the first place so um we had a lot of shots but obviously not the clearest only three or so where americorps were made top saves yeah and then we can see the goal um after throwing i think and um switch to the other side i think kawasaki wanted to shoot but um i mean it just was there and thats it and you must be disappointed to go on the break like that that you the one you gave away yeah yeah yeah oh look go to concede you never like thats actually another if they shoot from 25 yards its a a goal you dont like as well yes but um again the boys um tried absolutely everything i think especially after we were bounded down um then we actually played like we wanted to play before because with the deep formation we had the midfield our midfielders too deep we could have been there with the center half the midfielders more in the formation could have caused them more problems but its really that the threat they are with the counterattacks its completely normal that you are more we wanted we wanted to be more or more brave in the second half thats what we said in half time um to yeah to use the um so the letter let us play we played we played around them and we should have played more in the formation than around so thats it youve still won two trophies this season i mean its youre challenged right to the end i mean its hard to get that kind of perspective right now but no no its not hard no its i i have that already but actually im to be on numbers im the only one in the dressing um but its like its its its feels different um and i know i set it off we lost that skin civilian basil and um or in kiev and these kind of things its a its its not bad to get to the final and thats already kind of success i know not a success you want to have but i have the strong feeling we come again wow thats how it is because the boys really competitive we have an outstanding group together we will have again an outstanding group together next year and then we go again and um yeah we obviously we have to try it a bit more often than others but um no problem thats what you did last time in kiev you came back to in madrid so wheres the next year is that chelsea found yeah booked the hotel put it in the diarrhea thanks jorge
8BXG6ojA4l8,2022 honda civic sport touring manual hatchback  pov review,Sport,today were driving the 2022 honda civic hatchback sport touring and we have joy of joys a sixspeed manual transmission lets walk around this new civic hatchback show you what its like inside and out well take it for a drive and hopefully give you guys an idea of what its like to live with this new hatchback coming out this year we have a lot of cargo space in the back of this actually you know what lets just go back there and show you around a few months ago we drove the new civic sedan and i really really like that car the cvt was ultra smooth and actually this manual is pretty good too the manual is available in both the sport and the sport touring trims so you can have it with a base 2liter naturally aspirated engine or this turbocharged 15 liter it makes 180 horsepower 177 poundfeet of torque a little over 3000 pounds its rated for 28 miles to the gallon of the city 37 on the highway a lot of cargo space in the back of this hatchback with the seats folded down like we have now you can fit all sorts of stuff back here mountain bikes furniture you even get a compact spare tire with a jack and some other accessories lets fold these rear seats up show you what cargo looks like with everything up a lot of room in the back seats tons of leg space this is encroaching upon a cord levels of interior volume honda always does a really nice job with their interior packaging yeah really nice looking hatchback the rear end i think is a bit of a funky design but i think it still keeps with the rest of the car less hatchback and more lift back this is 49 inches shorter than the sedan and thats all just in the rear end the rest of the car is pretty much the same we have a slightly different front grille where the honda badge is located but really thats kind of the only difference between this and the sedan same engine same interior we have a slightly stiffer rear suspension setup a little bit beefier sway bar eight percent stiffer rear springs tons of legroom tons of space in the back of this you get a couple usb ports a nice arm rest the leather and the sport touring trim feels very good this comes in at twenty nine thousand four hundred dollars its also available in a cvt but i gotta say this manual is a big improvement especially over the honda civic sport that we had in the previous generation lets show you under the hood this is a really nice torquey 15 liter turbo super fuel efficient spools up very quickly got a lot of torque down low pulls nicely into the high revs doesnt sound like much its pretty quiet but at least its an exposed engine look how easy this thing is to work on turbochargers right there no engine covers i got to give honda credit for keeping their engines natural looking pretty good looking car in my opinion i like the front end the profile looks pretty good too and look at the stance these wheels are really pushed out nicely to the edges of the car two functional exhaust tips in the back lets hop up front show you guys around this interior well take this thing for a drive we also get a bose sound system in this new civic really nice sound system i think its slightly better than the mazda cx30s bose its up there with some of the best audio in the industry and for the price point you cant beat it we have a couple different drive modes in this manual trim eco mode and eco mode off i cant really tell the difference between eco mode and normal mode i think the throttle is just dulled a little bit but thats about it we get a bunch of different honda sensing and safety features road departure mitigation blind spot information low speed braking control and collision mitigation braking this fully digital gauge cluster is really nice its easy to read its simple its sharp theres not too much information to distract you you can add certain things like your fuel economy your range navigation whos sitting in your car maintenance stuff like that to this right display or you can just choose to have no content and on the left side you can also customize various things with your radio and phone i really love what hondas done with this interior everything is a button a knob a control no touch haptic feedback stuff except for the screen and even then you get physical home and back buttons with a volume knob track selection this infotainment is pretty responsive we have wireless apple carplay and android auto which is fantastic touchscreen works great it comes falls to hand very easily position next to the steering wheel we have a bunch of different settings customizable features you can go in change your bose center point sound a lot of vehicle settings too that you can adjust tpms calibration driver assist system setup take a look at this manual transmission its a lot stiffer and a lot tighter than the previous generation i liken the 10th generation civics manual to a logitech shifter i wasnt a fan this is a big improvement ill show you guys what its like on the road here soon a lot of nice cargo space decently sized cup holders theres the glove box these vent controls are really nice just a a simple easy to use userfriendly minimal interior and that kind of plays out to the rest of the vehicle too honda has gone a really nice direction with this new civic weve got a decent reverse camera pretty wide angle you can adjust your view angle there not the highest resolution or prettiest display but it shows you what you need to see turning lines too which is always great electronic parking brake it will disengage automatically as soon as you set off which is nice weve got a great little spot here to charge our phone with wireless charging we get a couple usb ports too a 12 volt 180 watt cigarette lighter port comfortable seats a good amount of storage in the door pockets auto up down windows for the front two windows parking sensors traction control a little place to put your sunglasses up here theres the sunroof you can tilt or push it all the way back those move to block the sun all right i think its a walk around lets take this thing for a drive so clutch pedal super lightweight not a lot of feel at the engagement point but about average for most modern manual transmissions in this class the steering is light this car feels taut and well planted like i mentioned earlier torque comes on pretty early down low on the power band in this new civic this is a great engine and paired with a 6speed manual its pretty fun to drive its not quite a civic si but its a really nice inbetween decently quick 180 horsepower goes a long way in this car the pedals are well positioned for heel toe downshifting weve got a little bit of rev hang in the higher rpms but your inputs here feel really nice i like the steering feel it weights up nicely around a corner and i actually really like the shifter feel here this is honda doing a nice job with their shifter in this car again its just notchy enough its a bit of a shorter throw too which i appreciate engine is nice and responsive too it responds well to rev match downshifts theres quite a bit of rev hang which is to be expected nothings changed in the last decade with regards to that but still that said its not terrible and its not a deal breaker driving this car around for the last 30 40 minutes or so its gotten more accustomed and more attuned to my driving style lets do a quick break test oh yeah it feels good lets turn off traction control and well do a zero to sixty music gear tops out about 55 miles per hour turn everything back on there decently quick guys this is kind of one of the last manual transmission hatchbacks on sale these days i really applaud honda for selling this in both the sport and sport touring trims its so nice to be able to get this with both engine configurations and get this in a pretty much fully loaded car really the only thing youre missing out on in this manual civic hatchback are just some of the honda sensing features cant quite do the same things that it can with an automatic transmission because theres a clutch pedal and you as the driver and the car wouldnt want to bring itself all the way down from speed and stall that would be pretty dangerous so weve got some weve got some concessions that we have to make for the manual but overall i think if youre an enthusiast and you want a fun daily driver commuter thats efficient and well priced guys this is the best option on the market i definitely take one of these over at corolla i think its a bit more fun to drive definitely quicker much more spacious this 15 turbo really does have a satisfying pull to it the front end of this car just feels awesome so sharp really darts into a corner nicely get a hint of understeer on throttle but overall for a front wheel drive car this is a really nice neutral chassis the rides a little bit stiffer than the sedan but i dont know if you would notice it too much back to back just that rear end is a little bit tighter gives this car a bit more rotation and a more active chassis which i appreciate i believe its a solid rear sway bar slightly tweaked from the sedan and we have eight percent stiffer spring rates in this hatch all across the board my question is if this civic sport is this good to drive whats the civic si going to be like and then whats the civic type r going to be like this is a really really great starting point for the civic if youre not interested in the si this is a fantastic option the handling here the chassis its really not much you can improve upon it except for maybe a stickier tire so one quick note with tires and nvh with this new civic hatchback this does have a different continental tire on it than the civic sedan i believe the civic center had good years and there was quite a bit of impact noise and nvh over bumps and youll notice in this drive that the civic hatchback is considerably quieter over rough pavement than the sedan is thats partially due to some more sound insulation throughout the car but also that tire change makes a big difference so one of my only complaints about the sedan i think has been addressed pretty well here with this hatchback with this continental tire and the extra headed sound insulation if you compare both videos youll see that in this drive really kind of struggling to come up with any complaints about this new civic its such a great overall car it looks great functionally fantastic very user friendly easy to live with the performance here is really nice its fun to drive its a little bit quiet has its pros and cons and you can always make things louder with the aftermarket the rev hang isnt awesome but its to be expected from honda and also its still a fun car to drive with it just got to let that clutch out a little bit sooner theres a bit of tire noise over potholes but its not bad i feel like this is maybe a little bit quieter than the sedan was over bumps im gonna have to live with it for a little bit this week but you can have a conversation in here its fine were on a pretty rough road right now and its not like were driving on run flats it doesnt sound like that off throttle theres not a lot of engine braking the relationship between the way the engine builds boost the pedals the shifter its a pretty pleasurable driving experience im impressed you guys i didnt really know what to expect with this new civic hatch manual and getting behind the wheel and spending some time with it this is a fun little car i think what the si and the type bar will just build upon this is just add more excitement more boost better engine sounds hopefully they dont ruin uh the engine pipe didnt sound like they did with the previous si in the new one were going to test that out in a few weeks heading out to california to drive the new si and i have high hopes after driving the civic sport hatchback you can even heal toe music and that last thousand rpm you almost feel like you could hear a hint of vtec but of course there isnt any but the engine just kind of comes on gets a little bit louder which is nice get a slight vibration through the steering wheel below 5000 rpm the rev hang actually isnt too bad its really when you get up into those higher revs is where it presents itself but you guys can see it as soon as i let off the gas put the clutch pedal on the revs are still dropping relatively quickly i think it might even be a little bit of an improvement over previous generation civics theres no auto wrap matching in this car you have to do it all yourself definitely another feature that the civic si and or civic type r will add brakes feel really nice too pretty stiff pedal very positive engagement nice bite this still has the same wheelbase as the sedan but that shorter overhang on the rear end gives this car a little bit more of a flickable fun feel around the corners the wiper nozzles are integrated inside the wiper thats always cool yeah the handling here is just super impressive the thing i like most about the civic hatchback is that its a fluid car to drive with the manual transmission thats kind of one of my biggest concerns about any new car that comes out with the manual is has the company done the due diligence and done the development to make it a good manual transmission its gonna have a pretty low take rate from buyers only five to ten percent probably and i think made the effort to make it a good manual and im glad to report that honda has this manual transmission feels great its a fluid natural driving experience all of your inputs work and correspond nicely when i take the manual over the cvt personally yeah i probably would the cvt is really nice in this car though its a fantastic transmission it is great being able to row your own gears and just having control over everything though with this six speed music see how it handles a roundabout music oh yeah nice rotation very little understeer this would be a fun little autocross card too music so all right guys so pretty high marks for the new civic hatchback and this sport touring trim this is all kind of all youd really want out of a daily driver very excited to drive this car and experience it today hopefully you enjoyed this video and it gave you a good idea of what this thing is like behind the wheel gonna see a sound system test stay tuned uh or check out the sound system test from the bose audio in the civic sedan that we tested a few months ago if you want to see more driving videos on this civic hatchback sport i uploaded a video to the winding road magazine channel just driving no talking so i think we had a slightly better time in this video the rear end is growing on me i just love the stance of this car these 18 inch wheels look pretty good you still get a decent amount of sidewall on here for what it is it does what it needs to and thats all you can ask all right guys thanks for watching stay tuned we might be doing another video on the civic sport two liter naturally aspirated engine car im not sure if theyll have one here they probably will but if they do youll see an upload on that its 15 turbo though might be the one to go this is a fun car to drive quick enough handles great practical looks good does all the things well done honda all right guys thanks for watching well see you in the next one take care

3yvVjrVpzws,fascinating mo salah interview  i want to play real madrid in final as he targets 2018 revenge,Sport,annies with us now your wish is our command mo first of all from all of us huge congratulations just take us and more importantly the liverpool fans watching this inside that dressing room right now what was being said what was the atmosphere like well its a great to be in the final for three times in five years is unbelievable everybodys happy inside im sure theyre gonna celebrate drink a little bit but we have a game next week so we have to focus on it as well so we just we celebrate today tomorrow well start from as a new day and we just go from there you talk about uh celebrating how long do them celebrations us i remember when i played and you had big moments you dont they dont last long because youre so focused on whats next when would your mind then immediately be on to the next game spurs at the weekend i think i think tomorrow like today you have to enjoy it youre in the finals so you have to give it time you have to you have to enjoy the moment but then from tomorrow its a different competition you cant lose a game against spurs so i think he will just enjoy tonight then go again from tomorrow mo how can how special is this team and that you can go from playing in the first half and being dominated by villarrealty just in a moment and totally dominate and almost kill the game within minutes i think its it was tough in the first half but then we went to the dressing rooms the guffers start talk and let talk to each other as well thats just character and personality in the dressing room shows that we we are in top team we are on top level so thats why we can uh strike back after losing to the first half play away so its uh its uh i think it makes the win more exciting is the guy for talking or is he shouting he was more talking than in the end mo how do you keep your personal levels so high you know youve been away for the african nations and youve come back and you play most games how do you keep your levels so high i think i dont know i just give give the team everything in and egypt also in the tournament i give everything for the national team you came back its um its gone already the competition there was egypts gun so you have to focus with the team now because we fight for everything so we win one trophy so now were in the final we also keep fighting for the premier league and we have final against chelsea so just like i stay i stay in my way i just focus train hard just try to recover and just stay away from everything just focus i know what i want in the end of the season so hopefully i can get what i want so talking about knowing what you wanted at the end of the season at the beginning do you set yourself targets goal wise and assistwise always always always always before the season start and i know what i want from the season individual and collective for sure conduct is the most important thing and the first target for the team as well um so i think 30 goals and 15 assists already is that is that above or below where you was expecting not below is it i have a big expectation for myself um honestly i never said that before but before the season starts i was like okay i go for 40 goals this season and music 10 assists 15 assists so now i reached out so youre hitting i need to focus in the garden now selfish motel for the next game i think now trent is going to be angry because im the highest assist in the premier league but i am im going to go for everything so hopefully and even in your wildest dreams when you were setting your targets for the start of the season the quadruple was not part of that thinking was it no because most assists is not its not something really big the topic score is always something really big for the team but i still like like today when i give the ball to fab it change everything the game change when we score the first goal so assist count for sure uh goals as well i think im a twoform the team is doing unbelievable so lets lets hope for the best and when you talk about your targets away from a personal target with a team target is it the quadruple is that your personal target now are you thinking about that yeah for sure um maybe not in the beginning of the season because im always honest but i always focus on champions league in the premier league but now we are close for everything so why not so do you remember when you started to think this is possible i think after we beat like city in a semifinal thats the cub but i think in the champions league from the beginning after the ruby stage we were playing unbelievable games and we we have a really tough group so we beat everybody so i started this time i said okay were gonna win the champions league this year looking forward to tomorrow the other semifinal man city versus real madrid great game last week we asked virgil before do you have a preference which side you play the english team or the spanish team well uh yeah i want to play madrid but i have to be honest uh city is really tough team will play against him a few times this season but i think its uh if youre asking me personally i would prefer madrid a little bit of payback because we lost in the final people so i want i want i want to play against them uh hopefully you win it from them as well brilliant and the final question look we have obviously lots of liverpool fans watching this but also lots of footballers young footballers are not operating at the level youre operating at but with big dreams what do you go through to not allow the situation youre in to overall you how do you keep calm when youre fighting on so many fronts and the opportunity is so huge here yeah i think you dont have to think about all of that you just take it day by day game bar game i just like need to focus on your work the most important thing is to work hard just stay in your way dont dont listen to anyone just know your target uh set goal in your mind and just go from there great okay so were expecting four trophies and ten more goals and youve reached the top five games thank you top man congratulations thank you welcome thank you a great night for you and a great night for liverpool thanks very much for joining
ZTIccw4pGLE,exstig ben collins drives the 273mph bugatti chiron super sport,Sport,music this is bugatti hq where their mission is to reach for the sky as far as im concerned the first hypercar was the bugatti eb110 the first car to reach 60 miles per hour and around three seconds and it had a kind of boxy look it was like the tyson fury of hyper cars when bugatti returned with the veyron they returned in force in 2005 with speeds of 250 miles per hour it was totally unprecedented like the invention of supersonic air travel in the concorde and that leads us to this moment the bugatti chiron super sport music this car is an exercise in unbelievable numbers 1600 horsepower 24 seconds to 60 electronically limited to 273 miles per hour but unrestricted it would go on to 304 miles per hour the fastest speed ever achieved by any production road car i drove the veyron supersport on top gear some years ago so drive tribe has sent me to see how this compared it turns out that mike chose an abysmal week to be on holiday the statistics with this machine are just mindblowing i mean the veyron was impressive the engine was consuming 45 000 liters of air a minute this ones consuming 60 000 liters of air in it to power this engine when its really going for it michelin could only get the tyres to be rated to run at top speed for 15 minutes but never been tested because you ran out of fuel in 12 in fact thats the only thing youve got to worry about when youre driving a car this potent is remembering where the next petrol station is and making sure that its got the correct run for this beast with the attack of air hitting this car at speeds above 200 miles an hour the aero forces are just ridiculous the centrifugal force in the tyres 5000 g and something like 4 000 kilograms of aero pressure flying around this car so the balancing act to get this car to prevent it from flipping over even at 300 miles per hour was a real mind tease for the engineers when they built this thing but to help reduce drag the car was elongated by 25 centimeters youve got that little extra piece of arrow in the back that just made the car cut through the air that bit better gave it more of the teardrop shape which you know gives more error efficiency the boost of power obviously from this reconfigured engine significantly different from the original 16 cylinder motor the 8 liter beast powering this baby the physical block of the engine is pretty much the same but 80 percent of the internals revised from the veyron to the cheer on to give it that big jump in power to 1500 and more fine tuning to bring the super sport up to 1600 the way this chiron goes about demolishing stretches of road is beyond impressive but theres more to the super sport than outright speed the cabin is a wonderful place to be an elegant blend of reassuringly tactile leather and extruded aluminium it feels more spacious than the veyron but theres a bit of an optical illusion at play pikachu shrunk the gear selector the controls are more slender but it gives a sense of agility the question is does that translate onto the road you do tend to feel it the front end first just clawing at the tarmac frankly i prefer it that way than feeling the rear end of this baby swing around music its just too much going on youre operating at such a high level of grip you dont want the tail swinging around at will applause what a absolute beast car really welcomes you in it does hug the corners its fantastic in the banks corners you really feel it tucking in music the irony is that with this much power its basically the equivalent of an m3 on each wheel 1600 horsepower youve got to break that down 400 horsepower per tire its just unbelievable its just been harnessed so beautifully into this really easy to drive package thats thanks to the depth and breadth of engineering that goes into these speed machines because at bugatti over engineering is just the starting point its not good enough for their cars to simply be fast they must be refined impeccably built and ready to defy physics at any given moment thatll do doesnt exist in the bugatti vocabulary weve been driving this for a while now and im realizing that i actually i still havent put my foot to the floor my instinct is just saying just keep it on the island and were surrounded by trees i guess theres the odd damp patch on the road close to zero degrees so maybe there might be a little bit of ice but come on ben this is what were here for but the cars telling me too because its telling me just very gently ive only used 1384 bhp is a little gauge here that tells you that so i have still got some capacity left so oh you just feel theres so much power there that youve just got to give it the respect that its due so much respect in fact that i need a chaperone to keep me in check although i wont complain as my codriver for the day is this bloke andy wallace winner of the holy trinity le mans daytona three times winner sebring two times youve won that thats it dude thank you very much for um guiding me through this its um its an absolute honour to be um in this car with you as my chaperone well thank you very much and thank you for scaring the living daylights out of me already yeah we just got started so youve worked on this project for how long ive been at bugatti for 11 years and ive had an absolute ball every day is different and every day is amazing in this car yeah but you were the one you pinned it to 304 miles an hour is that right 3047724 if you dont mind okay what does that feel like ill tell you what it is pretty terrifying in some ways because stuff is coming at you so fast you pass a kilometer in seven seconds or a mile in 11 and change yeah everythings coming towards you theres all sorts of things to think about but what a feeling when youve done it its amazing it is incredible but for daily running so this car although its not the 300 plus model its still the sheer on super sport it is capable of 300 miles an hour if you put it into the right mode its still capable of that speed it is i mean we electronically limit it to 273 thats much more sensitive its fine yeah im right in thinking this car also has launch control yes it does do you want to try it i would like to try it definitely like to try it okay theres a straight bit of road here its going to put my g sensor up absolutely one of those hightech g7 its a very high tech here we go little air freshener thats going to do that right brake on maximum pressure press the launch control button its engaged full power oh that was amazing that let rip on the rear isnt it obviously that was in the correct launch mode that took what two its 23 seconds to 60 miles an hour isnt it it did yep and i was looking at your gauge and i saw it was 15 g okay excellent perfect but we did get wheelspin so the car is allowing some slip is that right yeah in order to get off the line quickly if you limit all the slip it just restricts the car so you need some slip to get going yeah and so it allows it allows that but then something changed because i felt that it was the rear axle i felt going so the first time to be driving around i felt that so it released on the rear and then it just suddenly all four just went as a warner and it just had that massive surge of power and my my brain i felt some compression in my brain did you also have this sort of feeling yeah i got a bit dizzy slight bruises on the back of my eyes yeah where they hit the back of the sockets its just phenomenal great feeling though absolutely music the corner amazing the gforce and theres no gsuit i mean basically it is like flying a fighter jet at ground level thats what this is its got the same sort of performance 2g underbreaking from these carbon ceramic brakes there we are full power yeah once she goodies up youre just in another world i mean i realize that a lot of people do all these tests on the straights see why but this is where this car also is a hunter killer drivable power you just cant be on full power the whole time thats just not real world cant do 300 miles an hour going to the shops or driving up this mountain the true test is in the cornering and its just wonderful car is just taunting me though saying come on you havent got it in you to give me the full beans but im trying and im working on it warp speed very very quickly that little voice just whispering all the time engage the warp drive give it full power for me it feels like bugatti has really come of age with the chiron the super sport seems to achieve two almost impossible goals to increase the performance from the original veyron by a huge factor at the same time making it accessible this car isnt difficult to drive its its really easy it feels light on its feet balanced its taken the veyron which perhaps at times was a fraction wooden a little bit heavy in the controls not so keen to change direction eradicated that and created something that is really talking to the driver all the time sure there are other car makers that will take up these challenges of beating physics the way bugatti has and some will achieve it but few will match the flawless execution of sophisticated styling and robust engineering in every part of the machine and its not just about looks the design oozes confidence like an egyptian pyramid bugatti have achieved a seemingly impossible task delivering hyper performance in the form of a simple tool that anybody could use for cruising around on that note alone its worth every penny of the 35 million music you
IUwqf08-FKU,veterinarian answers pet questions from twitter  tech support  wired,Tech, im veterinarian dr molly mcallister and this is my dog jack today were here to answer your questions on twitter this is vet support upbeat drum music dontforgetchaos asks why dont we keep squirrels as pets we keep rats rabbits mice et cetera why not squirrels id like a pet squirrel no you wouldnt squirrels do not make good pets they are destructive they have teeth and claws and they will chew things up squirrels are not social animals in fact they will turn on people including handlers who have raised them from babies and number three squirrels are not able to be littertrained or trained in any way shape or form all in all squirrels dont make good pets stick with your dog your rabbit your mouse or even a rat santeisha asks where do these beep hairballs come from if you own a cat youve certainly seen them grooming they spend hours of their day quite literally grooming themselves by licking the fur that takes the loose hair and oftentimes they tend to swallow that and rather than digest it the cats gi system enables them to gather that hair up and regurgitate it so they do spit it back up and that ends up being the nice hairball that we find probably on our nice carpet and that is just the nature of cats so loremercad asks what causes obesity in cats and dogs its when the calories that they consume exceed the calories that they burn so its a mismatch in how much we feed them and how much activity they get because we control that and then lets make sure that they get lots of exercise as well because its good for all of us all right xxuemei asks why my sugar glider have so many problems crying face sugar gliders you know they are an exotic animal they have some husbandry challenges they require a unique environment so thats number one heres another big thing about them you know sugar gliders glide therefore they love playing and youve gotta have a safe enclosure or space for them to play because otherwise one of the most common things that happens with sugar gliders is trauma they glide into a curtain and they break a leg or they get strangled they end up somewhere theyre not supposed to be and they get stuck they get scratched they get hurt so youve gotta make sure youve got a safe place for your sugar glider the other piece is theyre pretty sensitive little critters they can dehydrate in a matter of hours if they dont have access to enough water theyre also very susceptible to toxins and so they eat a variety of fruits and vegetables and if you dont clean what you buy from the store well enough you can actually poison your sugar glider by giving them food thats contaminated at levels that wouldnt impact you or i but that do impact the sugar glider so at the end of the day if youre gonna have a sugar glider you gotta make sure you know what youre getting into and you gotta make sure you partner with a veterinarian who can help you make sure youre providing that sugar glider with the right environment and the right home and lifestyle to keep them healthy and safe as long as possible natehankz asks why are hedgehogs banned as pets in new york city yet people keep finding tigers in apartments you know taylor swift has at least two full jaguars and a goose now hedgehogs in particular they are are illegal in the five boroughs of new york city the reasons are because number one they can carry diseases that can be transmitted to other animals foot and mouth disease is the big one and number two oftentimes exotic animals are prohibited because if they were to escape they could do significant harm to the native wildlife in the area and thats the case with hedgehogs in new york city heres the thing exotic pets are a handful you gotta be careful with what youre getting into because they have unique needs in terms of the environment they need to live in so whether t swift is doing it or not we all should think twice or maybe three times before we adopt an exotic animal as a pet kolourfulgurl asks is cat urine toxic i think it is no i wouldnt recommend drinking it i wouldnt recommend injecting it but its not toxic its just urine lpusholdpeopl3 asks how do dogs get cancer like im sorry but are they smoking or sum heres the thing with dogs they get cancer for a lot of the same reasons we do first of all genetics they can just be predisposed certain breeds are predisposed to certain types of cancers for example we know that german shepherds and boxer dogs have a much higher likelihood of developing a cancer called hemangiosarcoma we also know that for example dogs with short hair can be more prone to developing something called a mast cell tumor but also just like us dogs are a recipient of whats in the environment around them so we know people sometimes get lung cancer even though they never smoked a day in their life same thing happens with dogs they live in the household where someone is smoking theyre close to contaminants or toxins think about where a dogs nose is all day theyre down on the ground so we dont always know why a dog gets cancer but what we do know is theyre exposed to the same kind of environments that we are and so the same things that cause cancer in people can cause cancer in dogs unfortunately okay for this question im gonna need to call in the expert lets call in jack jack come on so itsmelexie1 asks are you supposed to brush a dogs teeth and the simple answer to that question is yes we find that about 80 of dogs that come into our hospitals and 85 of cats between the ages of three and ten come in with evidence of dental disease so jack here is a great example of a dog who will let you brush his teeth and its something that you can start with any dog or cat from a young age jack sit good boy so one way if youve never done this before is to use a finger toothbrush so whats important is we call it flip the lip you flip the lip up you take a look at their teeth and you do a gentle scrub and then with bigger dogs or pets who are used to it you can actually use a special modified toothbrush that fits a dogs mouth you flip the lip and you go ahead and brush their teeth to remove that bacteria and that early source of dental infection or dental disease that we might find in our own teeth the teeth provide a really great surface area for bacteria to grab hold and as they begin to climb up under the gums they have really easy access to the circulatory system and once those bacteria get into the circulatory system they spread throughout the body so heres the thing when it comes to taking care of your pets teeth the reality is that they lead a shorter life than us a more accelerated life and so we should be taking care of their teeth to the same degree as we take care of our own if not even more the next question from petsqanda is whats the best way to cut a dogs nail whats really important is that you get your dog used to having their nails trimmed and this is something that you can start as a puppy because many dogs dont normally dont naturally like to have their paws touched so to cut a dogs nail you want to look closely and differentiate between the pink living flesh of their nail and the white part which is the same as the white part of our nails as it grows out beyond the blood vessels now this can be much harder to do in a dog with a dark nail and its also important to recognize that the more often you do it the more frequently you trim their nails the easier it becomes they that helps the blood vessels to recede so youre less likely to do what we call quicking them which means that youve cut it too short and youve actually cut into the sensitive tissue but i can show you here just a little bit where you find just the tip of the nail insert it through the trimmer quick trim his are so short that all im having to do is just scrape off the very edge of them make sure your dog gets used to you holding his paws and gets comfortable with that idea and do it on a regular basis yubavettech posts a question of the day how is heartworm spread and what is heartworm this is a fascinating question because heartworm is preventable it is extremely serious if dogs and cats acquire it but it is preventable so heartworm disease what is it well its a parasite thats transmitted by mosquitoes a mosquito bites a dog it picks up some baby parasites they develop within the mosquito and the next dog or cat that mosquito bites gets that heartworm disease those worms then spend about six months living in that animal until they take up residence in the heart where they mate they reproduce and they produce their own little baby parasites when a dog or cat acquires heartworm it is fatal unless treated it is treatable in dogs although quite expensive and quite risky it is not treatable in cats so the end of the story we need to prevent it this is a really important question this year because we know that because of temperature and climate changes that are expected in 2022 there will be a higher instance of heartworm so if you arent using heartworm preventative for your dog and cat today go talk to your veterinarian every pet should be on heartworm preventative every month of the year gracerasner asks why the hell would you declaw a cat do you know what declawing a cat actually is its amputation of the end digits of their fingers to remove their claws and that actually has been shown to result in long term chronic pain for cats who have been declawed you know the veterinary hospital that i work for banfield along with many others does not condone the practice of declawing cats anymore it does not generally solve the problem its intended to solve which is cats scratching or clawing and it is painful and harmful to the longterm wellbeing of our cats so lets not declaw cats lets talk to veterinary teams about what other options are available for them kjyoung428 asks the question what are the benefits and negative effects of neutering a male dog number one minimizing overpopulation if theyre neutered they cant reproduce so we wont have unwanted puppies there are a couple of other benefits one being that neutering a dog causes some behavior changes primarily important to most pet owners is that it diminishes their likelihood of roaming the other thing thats related to that sort of wandering behavior is that unneutered male dogs are more likely to be hit by a car thats really just secondary to the fact that theyre out wandering about but there are a couple of reasons like that that make it wise to neuter a dog if you dont have any intentions of breeding them petmd asks what is grainfree pet food really logistically grainfree pet food means that the pet food has taken traditional ingredients like wheat and corn and replace them with something like legumes or potatoes so the food still has a carbohydrate source but its been changed from a grain to a nongrain heres the thing we really have to get at with this question is is grainfree actually better and the reality is that what is most important in any pet food is the nutrients that are conveyed to the pet the fat the protein the carbohydrates the minerals the vitamins et cetera so what you wanna look at for a food is not whether its grainfree or not but you wanna look at the overall nutrient profile and definitely talk with your veterinary team to find the right diet that suits your pets unique nutritional needs mooseandriosmom asks if i gave my horse worm medicine in june but i do not believe it was a good brand can i give him another dose i think he needs it if i can find any with all the weirdos buying it humans should not be buying horse medicine for humans its for horses if you dewormed your horse in june and its july for example you dont need to deworm them again horses generally need to be dewormed in the spring and the fall worse comes to worse your vet can run what we call a fecal examination on your horses feces on their poop on their manure and find out if it does indeed have parasites and need to be dewormed thats a foolproof way you can cause harm by deworming a horse when they dont need it because we can actually cause resistance against the medications that we use to deworm horses in those parasites that do exist in the environment so survivorkitty asks okay advice whats the best way to get a cat to take its medication without being attacked first of all if youre lucky enough to have a dog or cat that will take their medication in their food make sure you talk to your vet and get something thats suitable to provide to them in that form they also make some great treats that you can buy over the counter that have little holes in them that enable you to put a pill or a little bit of liquid so you can give your pet a treat as you medicate them and many pets will take that some require the use of a little more intervention for example we make something called a pill gun which helps you to take the pill get it to the back of your pets mouth and kind of shoot it in so that they swallow it without too much resistance so if its not working talk to your veterinary team and theres definitely alternatives out there so those are all the questions we have time for today but jack those were some great questions werent they yeah upbeat music
m7Jw3a7CpNA,how to start a blog in 2022  by sophia lee,Fashion,this video is all about how to start a blog in 2022 so i started my blog when i was 19 years old four years ago which is crazy and it is now a seven figure a year business theres a team of six of us that now work with me on it and it has really turned into a fullon business i feel like i said in every video but it really is its like almost grown in to be more than a blog but it started as a traditional blog it still is a blog um and ive learned so much over the past four years on just how to start a blog and what i would do the same as when i originally started versus what i would do different i mean so much changes in four years on the internet so a lot of the things that i did i would not do any more but then there are the few things that i was like okay you did that was smart of you and i still recommend um so im gonna give you a little of not a little im gonna give you my major top tips on how to start a blog that makes money in 2022 and then um after i give you those tips im going to give you like the step by steps on how to actually go about starting a blog personally and just some tidbits from my experience tip number one has to do with when you should actually go and publish your blog and for some reason this has come up a lot this year like i dont know why this year its been asked so many more times than last year or the year before im just getting a ton of dms about it and then my courses have a facebook group so maybe thats where im seeing it but anyways it is when you should actually go and publish your blog so a lot of people think that they need to have like a certain number of blog posts written before publishing their website um or need it looking perfect and no you do not get it published as soon as possible the chances are unless you already have a following from another platform or something no one is going to be looking at your blog for the first month besides maybe your mom or someone that you send a direct link to you want to get it up as soon as possible because you want google to be able to scan it and the longer you have for google be able to figure out what your website is the better so this kind of is involved with seo which i had no idea what seo is when i first started my blog and now my entire life is run by seo so as you start your blog and as you grow into it and figure out more and more things youll learn a lot more about seo which stands for search engine optimization and basically on your website you need to do every single thing that you possibly can to let google know what your topic or your niche is about i have a blogging course this is really quick little plug i have a blog course perfecting blogging and that goes over all of my seo strategies and exactly how i do it you want to rank on google because if you search something in google then you want your post to come up first because obviously youll get the most clicks so like for example if i was to search um how long to cook a chicken breast in the oven for okay you know its like anything you search in google you have the websites that come up under that you want your website to rank first if you just go and write a blog post its not just gonna happen you have to do strategic things um so thats why i say to publish your website right away because like no one is going to be looking at it its going to take a while for you to start generating views so the sooner you can get it up the better this is another tip that i have in there well actually i just came up with this in my mind but it has to do with that first tip is it does not have to be perfect you are going to learn so much over that first year of vlogging i mean if you went back and looked at my old posts like my first blog post i had no idea what i was doing i was learning and just trying to figure it out so youre going to constantly be editing your website those that first year too were still editing our website every month to like with different things that were learning um so just get it out there like its not gonna be perfect and it shouldnt be perfect and the mo people that wait for it to look perfect are usually the ones that end up giving up because that just becomes like really stressful the second tip i have for you is how many blog posts should you be posting every single week and personally i would recommend posting two blog posts a week um that can be really hard like blog posts take a long time to write if youre doing them correctly and so if you dont have enough time to write two blog posts a week it is more important just to be consistent with it so if you can get one blog post out a week that is a whole lot better than one week doing three blog posts and then not doing anything for three weeks and then the next week doing one blog post and then the next week skipping and then you know what i mean like it is so much better to be consistent about it so when i first started for that first year i set a goal for myself to write a blog post or to have two blog posts go live every single week and that worked out really really well for me i set up a schedule im a big time blocker so i time blocked it out with like my college classes and i was working to um to like fit it in there i mean that worked out for me but if you dont have that amount of time or if you have kids and a fulltime job and like were all busy so if you have something else just be consistent with what youre doing so if you can do it twice a week do that if you can do it once a week do that but make sure every week you are doing it that twice a week or that once a week well you have to be consistent with it my third tip is something that we focused on personally a ton in 2020 or 2021 and was something that we had to focus on and was like a huge scare in the blogging world and that is to get your eggs in different baskets and this is something that i would probably recommend focusing on like when youre six months into your blog or even like closer to a year into your blog i strongly believe that when you start your website you should get your website running get blog posts up and get them on pinterest with social medias and with anything on the internet and with any business no matter what it is whether its a blog or any traditional type of business you can have things happen that you do not have control over for example pinterest still love it best social media for bloggers i personally believe they went through a huge algorithm change and in that algorithm change they like i cant even they just changed everything so we had to change our entire strategy which by the way our strategy in our course perfecting pinterest is fully updated and it is being super successful we actually had our highest month ever view wise on pinterest last month um which was incredible but we had to change so much and like even back in 2015 luckily this didnt affect me or maybe it was 2016 i cant really remember because i wasnt in it yet but facebook a ton of bloggers were getting like so much traffic from facebook and then facebook went and basically just stopped showing all their things so the bloggers that were fully focused on facebook ended up literally ruining their business and they like they were over because they didnt do that so for us this year we personally put a huge focus on making sure that we were equally where we equally had our eggs in different baskets whether its seo pinterest other social medias our own products just different stuff like that so like i said thats a little advanced so when youre first starting just get your blog up and get your pinterest started you dont really have to worry about the other things but as you go further along just have it in the back of your mind that you do need to eventually start working on the other things because its super important and crucial to actually like having a sustainable business all right i feel like im rambling so im gonna keep moving this faster but tip number four i believe is tick tock wow tick tock has taken the world by storm i know for me i can be on tick tock for literally hours and it will seem like i was on it for 20 minutes like i think it is a dangerous platform but as bloggers and as someone starting a blog or even like any social media whether youre starting youtube and instagram no matter what youre doing tiktok is the place to grow on i just started my tech talk a few months ago and im already at 100 000 followers and i know tic tac followers are like kind of weird and different than other platforms so maybe it doesnt mean as much but it has been incredible just to see how fast your content can grow on there like versus instagram when i say instagram is hard to grow on instagram is nearly impossible to grow on i think if youve tried you understand what im saying but tick tock is incredible so were trying its still trying to figure out our strategy as a blogger on tic tac but i just think someones starting a new blog that you should definitely experiment with tick tock a little bit and i know thats i feel like im being con i cant fully speak for like i just know for us pinterest and for a ton of other bloggers pinterest is the fastest way to get people to your website tick tock i think is the fastest way to grow however to get people to from tick tock to your website like i feel like thats another story but i just think of someone going on the internet and starting a space on the internet you need to have that in the back of your mind and were still experimenting so once we kind of figure out more like i figured out how to get views on my video and what like videos and what type of videos do the best im still experimenting im a tester through and through i test everything out so im kind of figuring that out what i still havent been able to figure out which is the instagram issue is how to get people from tick tock to my website on pinterest you can easily get people from your pin to your website but like i said tick tock you can just grow so insanely fast on that have ticktock in the back of your mind my next tip is something that is so helpful for me maybe this is a personality thing or um i dont know but our entire team does it and its so motivating and just helps us but have a goal planning session and write out a one year plan if youre just starting your blog just get a one year plan together on what you want to accomplish this year how long its going to take you your content calendar get a content calendar together of the different blog posts you want to write how many things you can get done the first year youre really going to be reorganizing things as you like kind of figure things out how long different things take you but having a goal planning session is just such a great motivator and something that i add into my calendar often because it can completely change what im doing and just really help me get more energized next tip is to research research research and test test test and so obviously youre already researching since you are on youtube and youre searching how to start a vlog in 2022 keep researching like still to this day google and youtube are my best friends whenever i have a question about anything im constantly googling it i take course after course blogging courses are so huge i have a video where i go over all the blogging courses i personally take it ill link it in the description and then um i have two blogging courses perfecting blogging which is like all about how to actually set up your blog and my seo strategies and then i have perfecting pinterest which is my pinterest strategy um so those are basically the courses that i wish i would have taken when i first started my blog but i do have all the lists of the courses that i personally take in my honest opinion on them i am a stickler for courses i think that courses are the reason that i was able to grow so fast this is just a repetitive thing that ive said in my other videos because i fully just believe in it and stand behind this so fast but were so fast i stand behind it so strongly um but blogging is really hard just to figure out everything and like figure out how to do things and so what i did is i made the decision when i was first starting my blog i babysat so much to save money for these things because i was broke i was paying for college on my own and um i would like pick up random babysitting nights and then i would put my money towards courses and whatever i was trying to learn at that time i would take a course on so ive taken a course on email marketing on pinterest on setting up like theres so many things email lists theres so many things that ive taken courses on and it has just skyrocketed in my business because instead of me taking months and months and months to figure something out ive been able to take course from a blogger who is extremely successful in it and then implement their strategies on my own blog and it just really sped up the process so um were lucky that were in a time where if you dont have the money to spend on courses youtube is incredible like you can get so much information from youtube my tip number four is to kind of or i dont even know what number were at but is to figure out what your goal is or what your angle is um for your blog so is your goal to make money as fast as possible is your goal to grow a following theres a lot of different strategies for that if youre looking to grow a following dont start a blog and start a tick tock in set like thats the way to do that and then once you get a following on tick tock then start a blog if youre looking to make money as soon as possible start a blog get your things on pinterest get as many readers as possible to your website and get ads established you can get ads on your website thats probably the fastest way that youll be able to make money and then you can keep growing it and then start working with brands or start doing your own products or whatever you want to do but theres a lot of different like you kind of have to know what you want to do like for me i knew that i needed i was one pain like i said i was paying for college on my own so i had to figure i needed to make money like i needed to make money and i also was like very strategic about what i needed because i knew if i could make money id have time and then i like i had because i was in college so i had some time where i could figure it out and then once i was making money then i could grow the following but if youre looking to grow a following as soon as possible then get on tick tock literally tic tac is where you should be and grow a following there for me like i said i was trying to make money so i went the traditional blog route i started my blog i only had a blog on pinterest for three years did not have an instagram did not have a youtube did not have a tick tock did not have anything besides a blog and a pinterest and in those three years i was able i just started my instagram not this in march of 2020 so its only been a year and a half since ive had my instagram and when i started my instagram i was already making 18 grand a month on my blog okay so like that was with no that was literally with just a blog and pinterest but i didnt i knew that i didnt have loyal readers at that point because its hard to grow a connection with just like a pinterest in a blog so thats why i then did expand to instagram because thats where you can really grow a connection with people and like now i feel like i have such a strong community and people know who like people that follow me know who i am and know my personality and stuff where i didnt have that but when i started you know like i said i was just wanting to make money and then i knew i could get to that point eventually where id have that connection and now its like turned into a brand so just its just a strategy again just kind of like figure out what is important to you and then um take that route all right i know that was kind of long but i feel like those are really important and um things that you need to know when starting your website but now lets get into the actual steps that i recommend doing i these are like super important because you oh god im like a broken marker with the strategy thing but you do have to be strategic about how you do it so number one i have my notes in front of me but number one start a selfhosted wordpress blog if you want to make money on your website it is so crucial that you start a selfhosted wordpress blog so basically what that means in the simplest terms as possible is that you dont want to rent a space you want to own a space so when you go to wix or squarespace or um if i was to do like buy so buy sophielyblogspotcom i am renting that space you want to own your space and this is what 99 of big bloggers use like this is basically standard even when you go apply to affiliates and that in affiliates is like how you make money in the future or brand deals or whatever theyll be like are you a selfhosted blog is your blog on wordpress theyll ask you these things and let me tell you its a pain in the butt to switch over i originally started on blogspotcom and to switch it over it was a disaster so get started on a selfhosted wordpress blog i personally was broke and so i started with bluehost which is your host i have a whole entire blog post on like step by step exactly what you do its super easy to follow and how i quickly explain what like bluehost is just the cheapest one theyre so nice their customer service is amazing and so like i always describe bluehost as like the walmart version and then like theres target so you could go a little higher step up then there is like a nordstrom but as you start in the beginning just get bluehost and i would just even recommend getting like the cheapest one so you can get it for 36 dont spend money on the extras like its just not worth it make sure that you actually stick with it before doing anything else so thats what i did i had a great experience i thats what i recommend today im always getting messages about how amazing other peoples experiences are um so anyways that is what i recommend for that step number two is get a website theme so a website theme is what your website is going to look like unless you are a website designer chances are just do not even try to design your own website ive tried and it looked horrible and so the easiest way to get a professional looking website is to get a wordpress theme you can get them all different places i had a wordpress theme from 17th avenue design and ill link them also in the description they were amazing their themes are so cute and like feminine if you want like a more feminine trendy looking theme go there if you go on etsy you can literally search wordpress themes and they have so many different options you can get them as cheap as like five dollars they obviously go up like some of them are 200 some of them were 50 some of them were 20 theres so many different price ranges that you can find for your budget um and you really want to make sure that you do this because people are going to judge you by how your website looks and you can clearly tell when a website when someone tries to design their own website and its just the fastest way to get that professional look so step one get yourself a selfhosted wordpress website step two is get yourself a wordpress theme step number three is if you have any money to invest in a course i would highly recommend it you can find courses that are really inexpensive and you can find courses that are really really expensive so this is just based on what your budget is ive already gone through that whole thing so i dont even feel like i need to hit on this anymore but um courses can skyrocket your business just make sure theyre reliable courses like read a ton of reviews research it if youre going to spend money on something you want to make sure that it is good but like i said courses can be incredible for growing your website as fast as possible step number four is start writing blog posts asap and get them on pinterest asap another thing that ive gone through a million times in this video so dont feel like i need hit on it anymore but that is so important dont overly think about it dont spend five hours writing your about page or even like i know some people that spend like two days writing their about page nope waste of time you have to think about your roi that first year and still to this day i think about roi so much return on investment and if it didnt make me money that first year i was not going to spend time on it so thats just something to consider a hot take but get the blog post written they do not have to be on they do not have to be perfect you can reedit them we reedit our blog posts literally every single day its like one of our things that we add into our weekly tasks to make them better and make them more perfect theyre never perfect but make them as good as possible and then get them on pinterest pinterest will be your best friend sometimes your enemy but most of the time itll be your best friend and then this kind of follows that one too but i feel like i should just read what i wrote down because it sounds pretty good but i would recommend not focusing on anything else besides writing posts and getting them on pinterest or tick tock if you think thats a better strategy for what your angle is for six months after that six months thats when you can start strategizing about the different eggs in your baskets or different strategies that you want to do to grow your blog but seriously so many people give up on their blogs like it is crazy theres people have a fantasy in their head about how amazing blogging is and how easy it is to earn money on your blog and how great of a life it is but think about how many people you know that have started a blog and have given it up it is really hard it is super overwhelming theres so many things that you are trying to do and focus on and so just to keep your life as easy as possible just stick with writing blog posts and getting them on pinterest and dont think about anything else for six months just figure that out and that will lead you to other things after that six months so those are my top tips for how to start a blog in 2022 i have so many blogging videos those are so helpful go and watch those on my website if you go to buy sofia leecom blogging i have so many different blog posts just about things that are really helpful i free guides and use youtube like i said use youtube theres just so many free resources that you can find but i hope that was really helpful i believe that blogging i mean obviously blogging is huge right now blogging is the future you could do yourself so good with starting a blog i am so thankful that i started mine in 2017 when i did because now four years later i am 24 i have a full on business and um its incredible so im so thankful but you can do the same thing it just takes a lot of hard work and its not as fun as people think it is super fun but its like that initial starting of it can be really difficult so just stick through with it and um it really is the best so i hope that was super helpful and make sure to subscribe to this channel i post blogging videos all the time and um i hope you have a great day you
WafWphQzUlo,4 levels of poutine amateur to food scientist  epicurious,Food,upbeat music  hi im emily and im a level one chef  hi im lorenzo and im a level two chef  my name is chris and im a chef instructor at the institute of culinary education upbeat music  its a frenchcanadian dish its from quebec im from eastern canada and i grew up eating poutine all the time im making my sort of homesick 20minutesonathursdaynight poutine  i have made this i cant even tell you 90 times in my lifetime theyre called drunken spuds is my recipe so its beer potatoes topped off with a chicken and pork combo gravy  my version contains shredded duck confit truffled french fries a circulated duck egg homemade cheese curds and duck demi glace mines gonna be good intense music upbeat music  so the first thing i have to do is make my fries so for this i have frozen fries  my french fries its beer potatoes and i season it with you know salt old bay give it a little something something i am using the ol russet potato  russet potato  the goto potato for a fluffy fried french fry  im making truffle fries first thing were gonna do make this flat nice and stable now were gonna cut half inch slices out of here so that they cook evenly  could i make my own fries sure would i make my own fries on a thursday night when its snowy out and im craving poutine probably not  i actually soak my potatoes in beer so it will release the starch from the potatoes and its gonna give the potatoes a little kick  soaking potatoes in beer all right i can get behind that  im gonna soak the potatoes in water and then run cold water over them to remove any excess starch this prevents the potatoes from sticking to each other while we fry them the first time  im gonna spread them out on here and were gonna bake them in the oven according to the directions on the package  how do i feel about frozen fries lorenzo groans  so were drying these potatoes off completely if theres any excess water youre probably gonna see a bunch of jumping bubbles of oil and we dont want that  im just gonna dump a few in and go for it oh beep its a lot of oil apologies thats a blooper reel i believe were just going to keep that out  were gonna make these at 18 to 20 minutes at 425  you can absolutely bake your fries but frying them will make them much crispier for a longer period of time i also dont think anyone eating poutine is really worried about their cholesterol im double frying my potatoes because the first step is going to get them nice and steamed through on the inside and then the second step is gonna make them extra crispy on the exterior  i absolutely love double frying but since i have cut these in kind of a really small small surface area thats why i dont do it  chris so my french fries are almost done you see how this can bend but it doesnt break  its important to season your fries when theyre still piping hot the seasoning will adhere to the potato first off if you wait till theyre cool theyll just flake right off whatever we dust it with i am gonna season my fries with a little bit of old bay seasoning and a little bit of kosher salt and those are my fries  right out of the fryer i have truffle salt and toss them with a little truffle oil to really accentuate that flavor just until theyre all nicely coated but not too glistening and these are my fries  now its time to make our gravy its pretty involved process laughs i will be making packet gravy brown gravy  im actually making a chicken and pork combo gravy  im gonna be making a duck demi glace gravy im gonna do equal parts ap flour and duck fat until i get this to the consistency of wet sand  all right lets just see if this is getting hot ooh nice all right now i wanna control the heat here i dont wanna burn my roux why are you doing that stop and then im gonna add in my chopped shallots and garlic  all i have to do is put my gravy mix into my pan and then slowly add the water while stirring and bringing it up to a boil thats literally it make sure i dont lose any good gravy powder  would i ever make gravy from a packet  its very salty its definitely not good for you but it is fantastic im just starting to heat it up and then im going to slowly add my water oops i should have done that first ♪ thats okay ♪ ♪ everythings fine ♪  now that the roux looks kind of sandy and pasty like this i know its ready to accept liquid so now im gonna start adding my liquid im gonna do a third at a time im gonna beat out any lumps that there could be in there  i am going to add my first of two broths this is my pork broth in filipino cooking you really combine broths to make a really interesting flavor then ill follow it off with my chicken broth so im adding in a little bit of ketchup i know a little odd but it actually adds a little bit of a zing  worcestershire sauce  worcestershire sauce kosher salt  salt  pepper  pepper balsamic vinegar  a little tiny touch of sriracha to have a little bit of vinegary flavor a little bit of acid and then also just a touch of heat what im looking for in this is a velvety gravy i dont want it to be too thick but i dont want it to be too thin basically what i want is i want it to coat the back of the spoon  whap  thats what im looking for okay and if you see i can do that now i know that my gravy is ready to go mischievous music  all and thats my gravy  and now cheese curds so this is the classic its a white cheddar cheese curd is sort of what youd normally see on a menu i love cheese curds theyre tangy theyre tasty but most importantly theyre what makes poutine poutine if you dont have cheese curds its not really poutine its like disco fries  most poutines are served with just the white cheese cards i prefer cheddar cheese curds just because its been aged a bit theres a little bit of a sharpness to it and its a pretty color you guys  im gonna be making my own cheese curds from scratch using whole milk and vegetable rennet  do i make my own cheese curds no im from canada i can just buy them  making my own cheese curds will be a much more dense texture and then a little bit more tang  so its going to be a blob kind of looks like the thing right now you can just separate these guys they will just fall apart  im gonna start by heating my milk to about 125 130 degrees fahrenheit now im gonna add my vegetable rennet and im gonna give it a little stir so its nicely incorporated so the rennet is an enzyme that is gonna cause a chemical reaction in the milk and its gonna separate the curds from the whey so you can see as i pull off from the side see all that liquid thats in the bottom thats our whey and then these solids that have formed that kind of look like yogurt those are our curds so next were gonna strain out our curds and our whey so i have cheese cloth on top of another strainer and then a bowl to catch all of the liquid the difference between cheese curds and ricotta cheese which is basically what this is at this point is that we want to make sure that theyre quite dry and solid they need to be almost squeaky in texture when you bite into them cheese curds squeaking  yeah there it is literally when youre chewing it you can hear a squeak in your teeth  but does it make a squeak thats so weird  as you chew in the back of your mouth like it imitates squeaking noise  i dont hear any squeaking you guys are messing with me  now that my cheese curds have chilled overnight theyre completely solid and im gonna chunk them by hand i want larger pieces so that they melt nice and evenly and these are my cheese curds  now its time to prep my garnish im gonna grind some black pepper for this thats kind of it why add something that i wouldnt really put on when i could just keep it classic you know  for my toppings im gonna chop up some thyme and parsley in a restaurant poutine is served with at least parsley ive also had it served with just thyme so i combine the two i love them both  now im gonna shred some duck confit to use as a topping so duck confit very simply are duck legs that have been salted or cured overnight and then cooked in their own fat the following day once we get to the drumstick im looking for a very small bone that i dont want to end up getting stuck in anyones throat this tiny little feather bone right here which is extremely thin and extremely sharp and that is my shredded duck confit  now its time to plate  so im gonna take my duck confit add it to the truffle fries  next is my cheddar cheese curds  theyre just a nice little surprise for when youre eating and then youre like oh theres another layer of cheese curds great  now im slathering the gravy on and away we go thats how i strategically place my gravy  so im just kind of glopping this on there no science  i have my truffle fries i have my shredded duck confit cheese curds and my duck gravy and then im gonna toss this all together i can already see that some of my cheese curds have started to melt a little bit and get a little string to them thats wonderful i have a duck egg here that i circulated for one hour at about 64 degrees celsius what that means is it sat in a water bath at a very particular temperature for one hour and this egg is gonna be very like almost fudgy  im just gonna top it off with the fresh herbs  now im just gonna garnish with some chives for some onion flavor and a little bit of color  boom ah it needs one last thing though emily hums canadian national anthem and this is my poutine camera flashes  and this is my poutine camera flashes  and this is my poutine camera flashes light upbeat music  is it fancy absolutely not is it gonna be delicious oh yeah  im absolutely super excited to crush this poutine can i do that now light upbeat music continues  mmm  mmm  mmm mm it tastes like home aw i miss my mom laughs  oh my gosh the cheese is beautifully warmed through and melting and just coating this crispy cheesy masterpiece  thats absolutely delicious im so happy with this drum strikes  poutine is a delicious combination of brown gravy fries and cheese curds and is a classic canadian treat from quebec lets see how each of our three chefs made theirs intense music emily used commercial frozen fries that she baked these are made from potatoes with the addition of vegetable oil coloring agents like annatto and preservatives like sodium acid pyrophosphate which helps the fries to retain internal moisture as theyre baked at high temperature lorenzo used russet potatoes he presoaked them in beer which is acidic and interacts with an enzyme called pectin methylesterase which aids in calcium and magnesium forming a complex to help maintain the structural pectin in the cell walls in short makes his fries very crunchy intense music emily used a packet of instant gravy these include salt and seasonings and agglomerated starches which have been partially gelatinized and drum dried so that theyre porous the porosity is important so that when water is added they thicken without lumps chris made a duck gravy with roux and duck stock which means molecular bonds in the starch vibrate when heat is added eventually break and allow water or in this case stock to be absorbed increasing viscosity in the process intense music emily used the quintessential cheese curds for her poutine cheese curds are freshly made and literally squeak when you bite into them because the casein proteins in the cheeses have not had time to form a compact network but are rather porous with plenty of air trapped inside the wet elastic curd vibrates when you bite into it and this vibration is at a frequency in the audible range this only happens in very fresh cheese curds though given time enzymes do their catabolic work and break down the proteins to form tightly woven networks and flavor compounds associated with various cheeses chris made his own cheese curds with dairy milk and an enzyme called rennet which strips away the negatively charged kappacasein and causes the larger casein micelle to form precipitate curds that are very firm and make that squeaking and bouncy sensation thats quintessential for authentic poutine this is definitely a level three elevation poutine is so satisfying and delicious if you need a new idea for making this quintessential dish we hope youll take some of these tips from our three extraordinary chefs

in the whole series and stuff thats real i could just tell  yeah i can tell  hes awesome  he is amazing i dont know if you could tell but there was like a lot of bug fixes theres some things that are better than before when i first played this we played this before it was launched in our last video so yeah im really excited everybody likes it okay so i need to basically go to mrbeast over and over and try to get all the pets in there and maybe i can even make some eco versions of the ones that i have stocking up in my inventory but first i need to grind a little bit and im gonna speed up the process by spending robux in my own game we need this vortex game pass its op and honestly pretty cheap its on sale so were gonna go ahead and use wait oh there it goes it just lagged yeah if that happens it might just be confirming that youre not exploiting or something  dj monopoli and by the way if you look at your petdex you can see all the pets that youve unlocked and were actually going

youtube videos of people playing this which was honestly dj and i just love searching sea cleaning simulator and watching you guys play its so fun im almost there  dj monopoli a lot of people think that this boat monster or trash monster is not op or something but it really is if you get the vortex and the speed boost you just completely destroy the trash you can just go straight through it its

7QDDaymJHYA,wayne rainey rides again  30 years after a crash that left him paralysed from the chest down,Sport,boy its been uh its been 30 years i cant believe im im here at goodwood about to ride this beast again music music so wayne are you ready to be reconnected with your trusted steed from 1992 its been in uh yamaha museum for 30 years and its been silent so the duke of richmond had this idea about trying to get me back to see if we could uh ride this bike here at this years event when i saw it when they had photos of it and they showed me that what it looked like in japan i mean it brought back great memories but when i think about that year what it was like to ride it it was anything but fun i think in 92 was probably the year that these bikes were very unforgiving and a lot of riders got hurt riding these bikes but you know it was well i was injured in 93 the next year after we won the championship on this and in 93 i was uh racing kevin for the world championship and and then you know i made a mistake and and in mazano italy and that was the end of my racing career but i remember early on when i was still in hospital the thought i had was that you know id like to get back on the bike here we are 30 years later and im actually going to throw a leg over this thing so i guess dreams do come true im injured from the chest down so i really dont feel anything except the bars so what im holding on to the bars and my my boots have uh bicycle clips like on a mountain bike yeah and then we have a strap that sits on the seat and then i set on top of the strap and that straps my legs over and puts those up against the fuel tank so i dont you know flop around that way i can feel the bike here in my chest right here against the tank pad to shift the bike to go up and up in the gear i hit the actual kill button so when i hit the kill button that that makes the bike shift up but thats thats really pretty easy considering how i backshift it so when you ride up twostroke 500 grand prebike most all the riders ride with their fingers on the clutch thats how you back shift the bike is that you pull the clutch in and that back shifts the bike i just got to remember when im going through the turns dont dont pull the clutch in thinking that you know yeah like i used to so cause it a backshift i still dont really know what its like to ride or on the hill yet im gonna find out for the first time tonight so yeah im a very curious about it very anxious about it but im very excited about it because i know i know when they fired the bike up earlier it sounded really nice its a sound that i remember well and this bike was very good to me in many ways my son rex is here he was only 10 months old when i was injured so hes never heard the bike or seen the bike hes never seen you on a grand prix bike no no and hell actually be the one you know lifting me up to set me on the bike so hes been working out getting ready for this yeah well have a couple of guys with us when i go to start therell be one on each side and somebody in front of me and ill just give them a nod and then they just kind of give me a gentle nudge and then ill just let the clutch out and thatll hopefully go in the right direction music applause music music music wow music wow that was cool all right wow what a thrill a little bit different than the last time i wrote it yeah wow wants to put all my joints in place this is crazy crazy acceleration that was fun i wish i wasnt running out of sunshine again you want to get it again yeah was it anything like you remembered in terms of the power of the delivery i didnt even actually get it on the pipe it was well you know when this bike starts to run at about 8 500 rpm hopefully i can uh get it in that range next time i ride it how was it for you how do you feel we were he was so far ahead of us we couldnt keep up with him so i mean to put it bluntly thats probably how a lot of his competitors felt racing against him for for years and years but you have to see them here on this one at this moment is uh thanks buddy yeah yeah its uh its so much amazing yeah some races i saw the tail end of them wow that was great that was a lot of fun well well call it a night a good night at that yes that it was

6Y-PeuGFaHc,your genes affect your education heres why thats controversial  kathryn paige harden,Education, conceiving a child is like a giant powerball if we think about any two parents there are 70 trillion possible genetic combinations that any one of their children could inherit so siblings are really different from one another in their education in their income even lifespan and genetics is part of the reason why but to study things like genetics in relation to education or intelligence or personality has long been a really controversial area of research for many people the idea of genetic differences between us is hard to reconcile with what they think of as equality but if we care about inequality that is tied to accidents of peoples birth the kind of stroke of luck over which they have no control then we should care about genetic inequality because it is one of the major sources of inequality in this country my name is paige harden im a professor of psychology at the university of texas at austin and i recently wrote a book called the genetic lottery why dna matters for social equality i think what a lot of people dont realize is that all humans are over 99 genetically the same regardless of their racial group even those differences dont fall along racial lines so most of our dna we have in common that remaining less than 1 however is really scientifically interesting because many of the psychological behavioral physical differences between us are related to that tiny fraction of our genome that differs between us how can we figure out which genetic variants are associated with some of the psychological differences that we care about your risk for schizophrenia your risk for depression how far you go in school i think a big part of the power of genetics is as a tool to help us understand the environment what are the social environments the school contexts the parenting environments that can turn on or turn off genetic risk so if im at genetic risk for doing poorly in school is there something about the school environment that can buffer me against that risk such that i still go on to do well in my math class such that i still go on to do well in college so were interested in bringing together the biological differences but also an understanding of the environment to see how they combine to shape childrens lives this work connecting genetics to things like education continues to be controversial because people fear eugenics and thats the idea that genetic differences underlie some natural hierarchy of value and that genetic information should be used to sort of slot people into their place or station in life white supremacist groups will be eager consumers of genetic research in order to justify their narratives around biological hierarchy but if scientists that have egalitarian values avoid the topic then the only people who are consuming it and talking about what it means are these ideological extremes the predominant response to the eugenic perspective has been what i call genomeblindness and thats really the idea that we should avoid talking about biological or genetic differences between people the fear is that if somethings genetic its natural and theres nothing we can do about it so lets not talk about genetics lest people give up on the idea of changing social policy and that doesnt bear out under the science things can be influenced by genetics but still responsive to the environment a great example is if you wear eyeglasses thats something that is geneticallycaused that we fix not by crispring your genome or selecting your embryo but by giving you an environmental intervention that you wear on your face so i think we can think of the antidote to eugenics not being genomeblindness but being antieugenics theres a really great example of antieugenic policy in the united states and thats the americans with disabilities act if you go into an ada compliant building there has to be an elevator there whats being equalized is not their functioning so someone might still not be able to walk they might still be in a wheelchair whats being equalized is their ability to participate with dignity in a public space in order to accomplish that you actually have to recognize differences between people what if we took that antieugenic disability justice perspective when were crafting policies i am an egalitarian i think of social inequality as a moral and political problem to be fixed but at the same time i think that biological differences between us are real and make a difference for our lives im out here saying science doesnt neatly fit into ideology what we need to do is think about what our values are what does the science say and then take both of those things seriously when were crafting policies

countrys holiest city even though theres so many people gathered there is a certain tranquility to this place like this bread or patty stuffed with chickpeas then cooked in flaming cow when it dries out it is an excellent combustible material well lets back up a second the city of varanasi goes back over 5000 years before history before tradition okay we are right now in the streets of varanasi going past me right at this moment is a human body this is a holy city filled with spirituality ritual and old souls transitioning to their final resting place music as for my own soul it quite possibly could use a cleansing in the sacred ganges river but first im gonna find something to eat good morning and welcome to varanasi right now were on the river ganges this place is known for two things one it is one of the oldest cities in the world and two its one of the holiest places in india with thousands of temples and of course people flocking here to the river itself varanasi also known as banaris or kashi in ancient times is the spiritual capital of india all along the river and as youre walking here theres just so many unique sights to see people with different colors patterns of zika on their forehead people with ceremonial clothing people who are coming here to hopefully get healed it is something like ive never seen before its very exciting those who have journeyed to the sacred place perform rituals descending to the rivers edge by way of the god an ancient stone stairway even though theres so many people gathered there is a certain tranquility to this place here they soak plunge or play in an effort to purify themselves for most hindu families a vial of this water is kept in every house so lets talk about food in india hindu is the majority religion and for some people that means no meat basically since this is a holy city were not gonna find any meat today its all gonna be vegetarian foods across the board in just a moment were gonna pull up on shore head into the city and see what we can music so find soon as you get off the boat people are here either they are putting clothes back on or stripping down to get in the water but theres so many different ways to worship to pray and to give gratitude while youre here beyond that you can buy candles you can buy incense just like its an unlimited number of things that you can see and discover while youre here today were starting our food tour with one of the citys favorite traditional breakfast options in a restaurant that goes back well over 100 years we have come to our first food this is called kachori sabzi kachori is the bread you see right here boiling frying in this hot oil and then the sabzi sabzi literally just means a vegetable dish here at the ramban dar they have two and were taken on both for four generations people have been here making this dish i mean can you imagine before the airplane or the car before facebook i mean is there anything before facebook almost nothing this place was here this mornings eating utensil it starts with a dough made of lentil paste and flour and roll it and deep fry soon thatll scoop up two types of sabzi alusabc with a potato base spiced with fried cumin also potato bay leaves turmeric and other secret masalas then chole sabzi is made of seasoned black chickpeas they also have green chutney and they have a sweet tamarind sauce here too upon ordering both sabzi are added to the bowl music then the two sauces pile that with katori bread and its ready to eat ive got some of the potato sauce some of the green chutney im gonna try that bread soon but lets go for this music oh yeah my taste buds are alive that is spicy its sour theres just tons of different seasonings going on there for such a meatless dish it is so full of flavor and body and doesnt feel like anything is missing im gonna put this on my kane im gonna grab some of this bread now the bread is brown fried delicious even by itself its a treasure im gonna scoop up whatever will stick to the bread little potato some chickpeas getting in on the party all of it mixed together lets go for it music crispy golden bread actually i got some cameron in there too so weve got spicy sweet savory sour like every flavor pulling in different directions if theres just so much happening in here this is less than a dollar you could get about three of these for one dollar and that is one heck of a breakfast the last thing i want to point out here are these incredible bowls its made from a leaf its been pressed in some kind of a machine so it holds your food perfectly and then look at the end of the day perfectly biodegradable leaf plates well its more of a salad now okay we are right now in the streets of varanasi going past me right at this moment is a human body in the spiritual city of varanasi perhaps no endeavor carries more weight than that of the proper and sacred passage to the afterlife evidence of this is seen routinely in the citys narrow streets as i told you this place is full of mysticism its full of religion faith worship a lot of people come here for the last days of their lives and that is something we just witnessed devout hindus believe that if a deceased ones ashes are laid here in the holiest of the seven sacred cities their soul will be transported to heaven and escape the cycle of rebirth this is pretty heavy stuff when all youre trying to do is grab a quick dessert lets talk about lassi lassie is a drink a snack a dessert and its loved all over india here in varanasi they do it a little differently and at this shop they can prepare it 100 different ways first curd and sugar are added to a steel mixing vessel and hand churned with a bit of ice until it becomes thick and yogurtlike this place is over a hundred years old that is whats so interesting about varanasi as you walk here you feel the history when the lossy base is ready he portions it into clay cups you could just drink it like this but im looking for more he adds almonds cashews pistachios and orange saffron water transforming its colors now more lassie curd cream and another complete layering of toppings all piled high before serving its so sweet and delicious crunchy delicious nuts give it some nice texture theres something in there a little tart and a little just slightly sour you can kind of have eaten and then half drink it this is like stomach therapy that breakfast we had it was heavy and it was heartburn inducing but this is whats gonna bring you back to life this is kind of the deluxe version its got a little bit of everything but here you can order 120 different types of last season are they super fast no not really but youve got patience and if youve got time they will bring you a lasting of your choosing and its going to be delicious the other thing that makes this place kind of cute and unique is inside theres passport photos of a lot of people my favorite part about the passport photos is its a lot of pictures of people looking stern a little scared that is different from when people actually try this for me this is awesome its a great snack its a dessert its whatever you want it to be in your time of need our next food is not a meal its not a snack its basically an ancient breath mint using a strange unexpected combination of ingredients hey how you doing oh right i forgot we cannot shake hands actually because here hes making pun his hands are actually stained from all the different ingredients and materials hes using to make this dish this is pun it was once thought of as a symbol of indian royalty and this food goes back more than 2 thousand years this third generation shop is nonstop kicking out different varieties of pond to patrons im going with the deluxe version you can try following along and making your own at home lets give it a try today were gonna get silver hunt made out of silver sunny in this woman has no idea what this is sonny who does voiceover knows everything lets cut to voiceover first the beetle leaf this is always the base add khatta then chana an infusion of saffron and slate lime to help binding of the leaf hes put on a nut mixture oh i love nuts especially adis nuts hows your pond looking at home good okay lets keep going next rose petals that have been cooked in sugar you all know already rose is not my favorite ingredient ever but that is a lot of rose petals then fruity green candy some green chutney more candy flavors and finally this clump of magical flavor dust now a slice of metal that indicates royalty and second place finishes oh this is the silver guys come on this isnt any old pun this is the silver pun i know what youre thinking sunny usually has to get the bronze pun and maybe i cant get the gold one but im going to keep saving in one day lastly garnish it with cherry and coconut shavings and this is the most packed confusing after dinner mint ive ever seen this is a very unique food i think a lot of people eat it here after dinner or for like a fun snack or to freshen their breath its uh great after a cigarette if youre trying to hide your smoking habit from your wife or girlfriend ill tell you that oh that guy just walked through the camera ive got it right here its a one biter lets go for it music wow theres so much flavor i thought the roses would be the worst part so syrupy over sweet minty and then you have the leaf itself which is a little bitter and mintier too like what quality eat a little bit its such a big overpowering bite i dont know how people handle that can i tell you something couldnt even taste it silver that is a wild experience here on the street to varanasi very nice music weve come to our next location right here we have pati nailed it our next street food is cooked in flaming cow dog but youd never expect it from how it looks lets back up first a wheat dough is stuffed with a filling made from chickpea powder raw mustard oil harem seeds red pepper corn and red chili pickle shape that into a ball as the dough balls pile up they light up a pile of dry cow dunk the use of dry cow dung as a fuel for fire goes back thousands of years theyre dry and extremely flammable turns out if you want you can cook on those dung patties too as you know in india cows are revered so technically this is holy i probably have to take that out of the video cow manure is remarkable for many reasons you put it in the soil it helps the vegetables and plants to grow big and strong but when it dries out it is an excellent combustible material now i know what youre thinking but its cow dung isnt that bad or what unhygienic the fact is its a million degrees beyond that all the cow dung is made out of organic matter anyways theyre eating grass and watermelons grains so its basically like were burning plants anyways they just happen to pass through a cow when the bread is ready dust off the excess ash and theyre ready for the next step to serve our vendor grabs a bowl and adds choca or potato curry its a mix of veggies spices roasted eggplant tomato and boiled potatoes add a bit of green chutney on top and then the bread dipped in ghee before serving music all right guys i have my next to it right here it looks tempting hot and spicy and let me tell you it is 106 degrees today its the perfect weather for spicy food lets try it out music oh what am i experiencing its so powerful and so intense its heavy and greasy spicy theres something super sour in there whats interesting is you know if i was in vietnam they would have some herbs to balance out the meal here our balance is just straight onion its like oh is that too spicy just eat raw onion then right look so inside you can see the filling it is that roasted chickpea flour its nutty it has a very thick texture chutney is bringing something hot something sour in many countries you go to your average meal is going to be either designated spicy savory sweet but in india theyre not afraid to do all three this is food that wakes you up at night as you remember the flavor in your dreams and youre youre in a seasonal masala sweat music overall delicious but man that is a powerful food with a kick on these streets im sweating from my arms the hindu religion itself has several subbranches though some tenets of the faith seem constant music most devout hindus are vegetarian though dairy consumption is still allowed and enjoyed widely applause music for those who follow the hindu faith the cow is to be revered and its seen as a mother figure the cow provides milk and gives life this is also why its not unusual to see cows in the street even in major metropolitan cities right now we are deep in the alleyways of varanasi this is a local indian confectionary where theyre making about a dozen different desserts that people can buy on the street india is famous for its desserts and their massive dessert making factories are something to behold this is called langleta on the outside it actually looks like a delicious wheat flour dumpling but its a kind of a dessert dumpling here in another small corner of varanasi the team from jai kopal mishtan bhandar confectionary have been producing this unique dessert for over three decades the filling is prepared right on the spot starting with koya a type of cooked reduced milk next add sugar and ground cloves thats what i love about india is whether its meal food or dessert food theyre always crossing boundaries and borders and kind of taking it to places i certainly wouldnt expect when the filling is thoroughly mixed it stuffed inside rolled flower sheets and contorted into their signature shape now the healthy part deep fry for 10 to 15 minutes until they turn a heavenly crispy golden brown in a separate pot filled with sugar syrup milk is added to remove impurities of previously cooked food particles after adding a touch of rose essence its ready submerge fried dessert saturating it completely right here i am sitting in the alleyway not so long ago a cow just walked through here and im hoping that it comes back to say hello im not sure if this is part of the cows natural diet but it could be so this is still hot and just dripping with decadence im just going to take a big bite and see what happens whoa oh theres such a mix of things going on this bready part is oh god it is filled with a hot syrup its like napalm you gotta be careful it will leak out onto you the best way to have any dessert in india is still blazing hot im gonna take another bite of that music not a ton of clovy flavor actually theres some dairy in there which is nice soft creamy and then theres the rose so you had this cool looking brown bottle of the soles of ten thousand fields of roses and he poured that into the ghee but also i think its been put inside of the stuffing too holy cow i mean actual theres a holy cow right there thats not even the one that came by earlier thats a calf where are these cows giving birth are they just doing it on the street i mean that would be the most ultimate insane thing to see in the streets of india back to this lets take another bite oh no i got a mouth full of cloves i like the clove it tastes like eating christmas candy or something an extraordinary dessert i didnt even know this existed getting to try it as you see a calf walk by even better we have one more left lets get to it were now approaching our final food of the day if i just show you each of the ingredients independently youd never guess what all this is about to become it has been an incredible journey throughout this entire day from the morning by the entrance to the river where people go and take a dip and worship all the way through these narrow pathways and alleys full of ancient history and foods and restaurants that have been around for hundreds of years here we have the final meal this is called chat chat is a family of savory treats that originated in india theyre considered snacks or starters its hard to explain its usually like a snacky item in india it can be crunchy and dry or it can be kind of soupy like this this soupy version is called tomatarchat and it packs a powerful heavy punch it is a beautiful mixture of ingredients there is so much flavor in here and it is so heavy inside this thing is like onethird butter on a hot tawa they add ghee and ginger then a mushy mash of tomato and loads of spices they mix in coriander garam masala chat masala red chili powder pink salt and even more ghee mix mash and mix again until its ready this is the base for this dish and itll be put together with even more ghee sugary syrup and a bit of lime hit it with a few more doses of chat masala and a tomato gravy music for texture fried crackers garnished with even more coriander then this highly concentrated flavor bomb is ready for action this is one of the only places in india where youre going to find something like this im going to try it out music oh thats the light bulb oh were doing a uturn its possible were causing a traffic jam but no worse than the cows lets talk about this very tomatoey but its not like a tomato sauce in this texture at all then theres crunchy elements in there theres some fresh elements because he put some herbs in there but lets be honest this is a heartburn factory right here so much tomato so much acidicness thats blended with a ton of masala spices and that really heavy heap theres pools of fat in here but they found a way to make it taste kind of balanced that is our final food for today i love it before departing varanasi i have one more order of business to attend to the ganges iconic holy inviting to all who seek it the new york times articles will tell you to steer clear writing the laundry list of afflictions that await you in these silty waters but these are the same people who tell you not to eat street food to live is to risk from the moment you wake up to the moment you nod off at night for me ill never be fulfilled telling myself that at least i played it safe at least i dodged a hypothetical calamity or some imagined outcome instead of certainty id rather have a story for life music music by the way the moment i stepped out of the ganges i slipped on the algae silk steps hit my leg and i couldnt walk for two weeks somehow this holy healing river

GT9k0i8CMMk,cost of living inflation hits 40year high as food prices rise,Food,the numbers have been climbing month by month now the trickle has turned into a flood of economic hardship and today inflation is the highest its been in four decades rising food costs have been a major driver just listen to whats happened to a bag of flour on average wheat is 160 it was already at about 210 before christmas invasion of ukraine its gone from 220 to 320 so thats been the biggest impact for us but on top of that you can see us behind flower bags all made of paper 50 increase weve had fuel 35 increase and all of that is having to be passed on to the end customer baker in this case the end customer though isnt just having to pay more for flour but everything else they buy too inflation is now its highest since 1982 hitting 91 percent and driving that rise the essentials food went up by 87 over the year to may road fuel prices are 328 higher than just 12 months ago high costs which economists say havent even peaked yet and pain which isnt been spread evenly the bank of england expects that inflation will exceed 11 in october but the poorest households are already experiencing doubledigit inflation according to the resolution foundation they spend more of their incomes on the essentials so an increase in food and fuel will have a much bigger impact so the wealthiest households right now are experiencing inflation of just over eight and a half percent the poorest are experiencing inflation of just under 10 and a half percent and thats now in shorts and sandals weather let alone before energy prices go up yet again in october very concerned about this winter because i know that the uh all the electricity bills are going to go up even more and people are not going to be able to cope we used to have treats for we cut them out we cut biscuits out you name it we tried to cut it all out for them though there is help on the way pensions will rise by almost 10 percent next april tomorrow more rail workers will strike again over demands for wage rises to fight the cost of living crisis which the chancellor said isnt possible today while defending pension hikes well its right that we reward our hardworking public sector workers with a pay rise but that needs to be proportionate and balanced with the need not to make the inflationary pressures worse and also to see whats affordable for the taxpayer now the slight difference with pensions is pensions are not an input cost into the cost of producing goods and services we all consume so they dont add to inflation in the same way public sector workers like teachers say a wage increase for them wont drive up prices and today the national education union demanded a 12 increase if youre in that middle income bracket are you feeling significantly worse off now than you were a year ago well the the key thing here is that real wages so adjusted for the effects of inflation they are falling overall were worse off the key thing is that the chancellor can decide who is made less worse off the chancellors cost of living package so far has reached 15 billion pounds directed at the households most in need but while the treasury deals with the politics of pay and pensions the nation struggles with prices and economic pain well economics reporter neil mcdonald is with me now neil any sign that this bad news might go away sometime soon im afraid no so the 91 figure were all talking about is uh inflation for consumers we also got figures today for inflation for companies if you like like the miller that we saw in pauls piece and those figures are equally uh startling the price of goods when theyre leaving the factory gate theyre rising at the fastest rate for 45 years the price of the raw materials going into those factories is rising at the fastest rate on record it seems inevitable that most of that is going to get passed on to us at some point soon theres always a bit of a row about pensions being protected against inflation but especially so now isnt that explain the controversy thats arisen here is about whats called the triple lock which is a policy the governments committed to and what this does is it says that the basic state pension should go up in line with inflation earnings or 25 percent whichever one is the highest and of course right now theres no prizes for guessing which one is the highest its inflation what that means is almost certainly next april basic state pension will go up by about 10 percent that protects pensioners from inflation thats a guarantee that very few workers have got and whats the justification for it well if you go back uh 25 years pensioners were more likely to be in poverty than working households but that is starting to change if you look here what these two lines show you are household incomes for those working age with children and pensioners 25 years ago pensioners trailing by about 3 800 pounds that gap has shrunk dramatically yeah now thats good news and of course there are still some pensioners who are in poverty but this does raise questions about how we should protect pensioners as a group going forward neil macdonald thanks very much indeed

VdLf4fihP78,fashion last week tonight with john oliver hbo,Fashion,fashion personality you can buy its what makes some people look fun and fabulous and what makes most men in their 20s wear variations of a plaid buttonup shirt every single day listen ive decided im not even gonna try im just gonna wear versions of this until im dead thats it we buy a lot of clothes in this country in 2013 americans purchased on average 64 items per person and were able to do that because clothing is incredibly cheap these days as you know if youve ever turned on your tv in the morning the price of this dress shocked a lot of people in our office 3999 lc by lauren conrad 35 thats our music this is a dress by norma kamali it is 24 get out get out seriously get out security get her out of here there is no way that dress is 24 go yourself you lied to me look for the consumer low prices are fantastic and nowadays those clothes will even look good because trendy clothing is cheaper than ever and cheap clothing is trendy than ever and this is largely thanks to the rise of socalled fastfashion retailers that produce stylish incredibly low cost clothing like hm zara and forever 21 the brand that enables midwestern tweens to dress like 40 something alcoholics attending the funeral over tel aviv nightclub owner its a powerful look and a big part of all these brands appeal is that theres always something new to buy just look at hm s rate of turnover stores are replenished daily from the streets to the runway the latest trends are scoured and can go from a sketch to the rack in little as three weeks we have new garments coming into the stores almost every day so if you go to an hm store today and come back to this later you will always find something new yes one day maybe you will find a shirt and it shares rising swag maybe next day youll find shirt with pardon my swag and make me next day after that you find cocaine dusted copy of nylon magazine in a fitting room something new at hm always always a to those prices are so competitive that a few years back they put out a dress that cost just 495 think about that that means you could take a five dollar bill scotch tape it over your genitals and youd be wearing a more expensive piece of clothing i went online and a jar of crickets food costs 5 a bunch of weird orange cubes you feed to a bug a worth five cents more than this dress that dress is only seven cents more than a dvd of the ghosts of girlfriends past inexpensive dvd raves variety and yes some how fast fashion companies are massively profitable the chairman of hm is the 28th richest person in the world and the cofounder of zara is the fourth richest person in the world that means people who own oil fields are worth less than a guy who makes distressed jean shorts buying clothes is cheaper and easier than ever and not just at fast fashion companies traditional retailers have lowered their prices as well which means the only way brands make money is through volume and thats why even basics like jeans now go through fashion cycles with the lifespan of mayflies obviously the big trend is skinny jeans so for spring forget about the skinny jean now its all about the flare jean jeans are the big thing for spring jonah is wearing the it jean of the season and that is the baggy jeans shes marrying these two trends that have been so controversial the culotte and the denim we got a denim culottes denim culottes finally an answer to the question what if an 18th century cabin boy was also canadian as great as all these stylish cheap clothes are at a certain point its hard not to look at those prices and wonder how does any clothing company make money although lets be honest you know the answer to that half of our clothing used to be made in the united states as recently as 1990 its remarkable and today 2 2 percent of the clothes we wear are made here thats right we produce clothes almost entirely overseas where its much cheaper and if 98 of your products could be made abroad you should really start changing your name to reflect that fact so american eagle should really become bangladeshi swan pen and banana republic should really become actually that one is fine they they got ahead of themselves there for once and and look i know you think youve heard this story before because you have if you remember in the 1990s sweatshops were a key point of outrage companies like gaap and nike were protested and then of course most famously there was this kathie lee gifford said she was shocked to learn that a clothing line bearing her name was manufactured at least in part in sweatshops and by underage workers yes kathie lees clothing line was caught using child labor which was surprising given how kindly shed always treated the small elderly boy who cohosted her show and the outcry over sweatshops wasnt just loud it got some results kathie lee even testified in front of congress we are now morally compelled to ask each of us what can we do to protect labor rights in factories around the world and right here in america and given that it was my own neglect that compelled us to ask this important moral question i say to you all you are welcome now lets start day drinking come on whats wrong with you people its 900 am cheers good morning but amazingly and i know this is hard to hear kathy lee did not solve everything in fact there has been a pattern of troubling behavior in the garment industry for the past 20 years just look at gap the nations number one supplier of polo shirts for frat guys to vomit on back in the 90s they were criticized for labor abuses of a factory making their clothes in el salvador in response they agreed to start an independent monitoring program which certainly pretty good to everyone besides they had that fun ad where idiots in illfitting khakis swing dance so we kind of forgot all about it until five years later when the bbc visited a factory making gap clothing in cambodia weve been told there were some children here making clothes for the gap this is son teeter shes 12 years old she told the factory shes 18 this is chance eater shes 14 she too lied to get the job monitors never questioned either of them oh come on that is no excuse if a child gained entry to a bar using a pinkberry punch card as a fake id its the bars fault oh it says here your middle name is one free topping cool middle name have fun in there in response gap revoked approval of that factory and enhanced their age verification requirements which sounded pretty good besides it was the year 2000 and they had that ad campaign wear pastel morons did the man bold so we kind of forgot all about it again until 7 years after that when a british newspaper visited a workshop in india according to a published report these children aged 10 to 13 were working as virtual slaves stitching embroidered shirts for gap kids okay stop having children make clothes for gap is bad enough having them make clothes for gap kids is somehow worse make a beautiful shirt thats exactly your size well ship it around the world will be worn once and thrown away now make a thousand more for me in response gaap said it didnt know its clothes were in that workshop and demanded its supplier make significant improvements to its oversight of subcontractors and everyone felt better especially because it was 2007 and gap had just had that mindblowingly cool holiday in your hood campaign with common fell into the gap day back in the hood seen peace in the streets when i look i know were talking about child labor but that may be the saddest that i felt so far then in 2010 a fire broke out at a factory in bangladesh that produced gap clothing killing 29 workers after that gap launched a building and fire safety plan which was great because it meant nothing alarming concerning gaps presence in bangladesh was ever going to happen again until 2013 when al jazeera found this theres no fire extinguisher no fire exit its just a shack in someones backyard how old how long have you been working here music luckily journal says old navy old navy is owned by gap inc yeah i guess at this point it seems sweatshops arent one of those 90s problems we got rid of like donnie wahlberg theyre more like one of those 90s problems were still very much dealing with like mark wahlberg now gap says those old navy jeans were rejected products sold without their knowledge and never ended up in their stores look all brands in the industry have problems gap is by no means the worst and if you ask gap as we did theyll point out theyve made real improvements and tried as hard as they can to fix all this but think about that that means a company trying as hard as it can has been not infrequently connected to labor violations in multiple countries over two decades and when you weigh all this up it seems the only situation in which gap could claim to be unambiguously helpful to people is when someone shits their pants directly outside one of their stores i never thought id say this but thank god gap is here to help you people are angels and one of the biggest problems with holding many brands accountable is that deniability seems to being stitched into the supply chain look at walmart they insist they hold their suppliers to high safety standards but cps visited a factory in bangladesh making clothes for walmart and found otherwise the boss at mondi apparels masa del hoc chowdhury showed us an evacuation map marking the location of 13 fire extinguishers but nearly all of them were missing well if theyre not there then thats not a map its an aspirational poster for fire safety but if that factory does not conform to walmart safety standards how were their clothes there the managers told us the factory hasnt been approved by walmart for production but they still had an order for a million walmart boxer shorts subcontracted to them by another factory i see so walmart sent it to an approved factory and that factory sent it to an unapproved factory without walmarts knowledge its just a crazy oneinamillion random accident that only happened multiple times over the past few years walmarts say their clothing suppliers in bangladesh were doing business with the factory without their knowledge one of its suppliers subcontracted part of the order to tessarin without their permission the order was placed with a troubled factory without its knowledge it had no idea of production ever happened there and this is not the first time walmart has been caught unaware no its not and they are losing the right to act surprised theyre like the characters in the hangover movies its its not an accident the third time boys its a pattern of reckless behavior which has to be addressed and look since the 90s weve sporadically cared about this including two years ago this week after the rana plaza building collapse five days after that deadly building collapse in bangladesh rescuers continue to pull survivors from the rubble new pictures overnight show dramatic rescue some using their bare hands to free those who are still trapped at least 360 people have been killed hundreds more still missing that building collapse ended up killing more than 1100 people everyone was justifiably horrified and that report aired on the today show so you know that everyone there heard it we then found out that brands like joe fresh and the childrens place had been made in rana plaza and we were horrified again and yet we get so blinded by low prices that just a few months later the today show was doing this this adorable sequined bag is from the childrens place i found it for under 10 wow want to spend a ton of money cuz youre gonna spill something on it i found this one which is a silk poly blend from joe fresh touch it 119 bucks get out get out get the felt of the studio and think about what youre doing because one of the ladies cooing over that 19 joe fresh blouse is kathie lee gifford and if she can forget the human cost of shockingly cheap clothing then that is not in that case actually thats surprising her brain is basically pickled in chardonnay at this point but it doesnt give you much hope for everyone else look this is going to keep happening as long as we let it so we need to show clothing brands not just that we care but why they should so we have a little surprise for the leaders of some of these companies im talking specifically about the heads of hmm of walmart of gap of joe fresh and of the childrens place i bought all of you lunch which will be turning up to your office tomorrow now full disclosure i do not know exactly how this food was made i told someone who may have told someone else to get the most food they could for the cheapest price and and they did that now i do have strict policies in place i told them not to spit on that food or to rub their balls on that food and ive trusted them to abide by that so i want you to look at the suspiciously cheap food that lands on your desks tomorrow i dont want you to king eat it and if you are thinking well i cant do that i dont know where it came from what if someone rubbed their balls on it then i dont know what to tell you other than now do you understand the importance of supply chain management but why am i telling you about your lunch when i can show you introducing the spring collection of your lunch tomorrow first please welcome dave is wearing an old navy shirt and shorts by his total outfit cost of 23 78 and hes carrying the frightening ly cheap sushi platter that will be arriving at your office tomorrow thank you dave lets move on to walmart christian is modeling both a summer maxi dress available for under 15 and dêtre a flautist that we got for just a dollar 75 each which is so close to being free its literally nauseating moving on to joe joe joe joe joe fresh and often is pairing a sweatshirt and casual pant that cost under 40 how is it so cheap its a mystery much like the contents of that gigantic pile of cheap dumplings that you will be eating tomorrow thank you austin lets move on to our hm collection we paired hailey sub 20 jeans and blouse with shrimp and salmon base 3 for 5 which will be genuinely arriving at your stockholm offices tomorrow im guessing that you will smell it before it gets into the room and finally thank you thank you finally please welcome to childrens place and say hello to elliot shes wearing an adorable white summer dress which cost less than 15 dollars and up whats that shes pulling that would be your lunch a selection of dirt cheap rotisserie chickens just to reiterate i have no idea where they came from or what might have happened to them along the way but elliot sure wants you to eat them isnt that right elliot exactly 88 them each this wagon of mystery chickens applause you
qPKHna_P9zE,biologist answers more biology questions from twitter  tech support  wired,Tech, ostoned asks bro how is coral an animal whats hits j oh hitting a joint so do you want me to say that im biologist and author thor hanson today ill be answering your questions from twitter this is biology support part two upbeat music paulrizzo28 asks wildearth do ostriches really hide their head in the sand no they dont its a myth and no ones quite sure where that myth came from although there are certain displays that male ostriches do during the breeding season where they get down on the ground and move their heads back and forth and sway and show off their amazing plumage but at no point do they actually burry their head in the sand icedancerben aks how do ticks latch on like that well if you ever get a chance to look closely at the mouth of a tick you will be horrified they have two little knife like blades that cut into the flesh and then something that looks like a tongue but with all of these barbs on it so that when its inserted it cannot be pulled out easily again and thats just the beginning the saliva of ticks includes an anticoagulant that prevents your blood from clotting it includes something to make your blood vessels expand so that more blood comes to the wound and it includes an analgesic a pain killer so that you wont feel a thing in fact the ability of ticks through their bite and their saliva to overcome our defenses is one of the reasons that so many diseases like lymes disease take advantage of ticks they are free loaders relying on the ways that ticks overcome our defenses and giving those disease organisms a free entry point into our bodies amandasmithsays weird biology question do female mammals get a monthly period or do they just get their periods during the mating season the answer is that most female mammals dont get a period at all menstruation as we know it in homosapiens is actually very rare in mammals known just from our species and mostly a few other primates and they have a cycle that is called estrus which can occur every few days in something like a mouse or only a few times a year in many of the larger mammals they reabsorb the uterine lining rather than shedding it ftblkwmn asks does salt really hurt slugs or is that some cartoon shit the answer is it really does hurt the slugs if youve ever left a salt shaker out in a humid environment you might have noticed that the salt tends to cake up thats because salt is very good at absorbing moisture and a slug is more or less like a bag of moisture so when you salt a slug the salt dehydrates the slug it draws the water out of the skin desiccates the slug and kills it harrywhoover asks how do murder hornets work do you just give them a list so murder hornets have been in the headlines lately because they are recently arrived in north america they are an asian species the asian giant hornet and its believed that they jumped over the pacific ocean not on their own wings but in shipping containers arriving probably in the port of vancouver in british columbia and over the border into the state of washington well i happen to have murder hornets right here in all three phases of their life cycle the larvae the pupae and the adult and we focus most of our attention on the adult because theyre large and scary and have a potent sting but in a lot of ways the trouble starts right here with the larvae because if you can imagine a nest a colony of murder hornets with hundreds or even thousands of these giant grubs that are hungry all the time its quite a job for the adults and they have developed then a particular strategy that sets them apart they target other social insects like honeybees or paper wasps where if they can succeed in overcoming the colony they can find a huge amount of food in one place to take back to feed to the kids back home and that strategy has led them to evolve this large body size with extremely thick exoskeletons that can withstand the stingers of the insects that theyre attacking so it really is the responsibility of the adults to feed the young that has driven their evolution to be so large and scary in the first place jakevig asks whats the weirdest animal platypus excluded in biology we dont necessarily think about animals as weird but we are very interested in the marvelous adaptations that some animals come up with so when were talking about finding strange ones we look in extreme places my favorite of these weird environments and odd creatures has to do with the carcasses of whales what we call whale falls when they sink to the bottom of the ocean and create their own little ecosystem and there are zombie worms that have evolved specifically to devour the bones of whales but they do so without mouths they excrete an acid that dissolves the bones of the whales and they live alongside bacteria that help transfer the nutrition from those dissolved bones inside the worm itself so in biology if you want to find strange creatures look in strange places ostoned asks bro how is coral an animal hits j so a coral is an animal a tiny animal with a mouth and with little tentacles that reach out and grab food from the water not all together dissimilar from something like a barnacle but where a barnacle lives alone corals live in colonies of thousands of clonelike individuals and they take on elaborate shapes to get themselves up off the ocean floor into the water column to feed but also to allow the dinoflagellates or algae that live alongside them to photosynthesize because the little coral polyps get some nutrition from the photosynthesis going on in their symbiotic algae and thats why many corals take on shapes that resemble plants theyre trying to increase the surface area of their structures so that more photosynthesis can take place and we all have a connection a surprising connection to corals and other shellmaking creatures in everyday life thats because when their shells break down in the ocean particularly in shallow tropical seas where corals and shellmakers are very very common those sediments harden into limestone which we then later mine to produce cement and you can track the course of the shell into the cement by looking for something called calcium carbonate which is the main component of shells and is found in cement as well and you can do so with the addition of hydrochloric acid which dissolves that calcium carbonate producing bubbles of carbon dioxide alongside water you can see it in the shell and you can see it in the cement which means of course that surprisingly enough even in our most built in environments were never really that far from a tropical beach kingkaiju8 asks botony biology question for all you plantcentric scientists are there any plants with pleasant common names but are instead deadly and or toxic the answer is yes and i happen to have the seeds of one of them right here these come from a plant pleasantly enough called the rosary pea and it is in the pea family and they do use these beautiful black and red seeds to make rosaries and other forms of jewelry but the plant is deadly deadly toxic one seed well chewed is enough to kill a person faunagrace asks do bulls really hate the color red the answer is no they dont hate the color red they cant even see the color red you could irritate a bull with a polka dot cape or a brown cape just as easily it is the motion that attracts their attention the color red was chosen one because its showy and it may please the audience and two for a more grizzly purpose it hides the blood stains that the injured bull might leave as it passes underneath jpetrou97 asks for viruses the goal is to continue to spread and manufacture by utilizing a host what good is a dead host therefore is there any reason to believe covid would mutate to be more deadly as opposed to more transmissible but less deadly well the short answer is yes we expect that a virus over its history in a population will eventually mutate into something less deadly and very transmissible because that is in the best interest of the virus itself but of course mutations are random events so there is still the chance that covid or other viruses particularly when theyre new in a population to have a mutation that produces something more severe hobvicore asks are the cells of an elephant bigger than the cells of a rat explain why or why not well the answer is no there are limits to how big a cell can grow whether its in a rat or an elephant because cells like any living thing they need fuel and they produce waste and the way that they get those things into and out of the cell is through a process called diffusion so if you get too large of a cell it becomes inefficient and you cant get the stuff all the way into the middle of the cell where it is required interestingly enough one of the only creatures out there to get around that limitation of diffusion is a particular group of very small organisms certain bacteria that have developed bubbles if you will within the cell called vacuoles that push all of the essential parts of the cell closer to that cell wall allowing the cell to grow larger and still be serviced by the process of diffusion from the outside so are the cells of an elephant larger than the cells of a rat the answer is no islandfangirl1 asks why will a mother bird abandon its chick if touched by a human well the answer is they dont thats a common myth many studies that use tagging of young birds rely on going to the nest applying a small tag to the bird and then of course returning it to the nest and allowing the mother to raise that bird to maturity now thats not to say we should all go out and start touching baby birds but it does point out that most birds have a very high loyalty to their eggs and to their chicks while theyre raising them and even if those nests are disturbed by us or by a potential predator or what have you the adult birds will most likely return and finish the job alamedamark asks question for biologists is there any other species that attacks its own species as frequently as humans do the answer is yes there are all sorts of species that attack members of their own species in nature consider the praying mantis where the female will happily decapitate the male after population and eat the male to provide a free meal and more energy for raising up her brood of eggs or consider lingcods and various fishes that are perfectly happy to eat smaller individuals of their own species they choose their meals by size not by whether or not theyre related but if we want to look for examples of planned attacks in nature it helps to look at one of our closest relatives the chimpanzees who are known to organize raids from one neighboring band to another neighboring band with the express purpose of finding isolated individuals and attacking them and even killing them that is a grizzly behavior but one that we can look upon with some familiarity because we see it in our own species elmostwitter asks question for biologists is it possible to bring back extinct species if so how bilogoy extinction really is for the most part forever that said there are efforts underway to bring back certain species that have dna preserved in a frozen state for example woolly mammoths where there is at least some recognizable dna in the carcasses that are still available in the frozen tundras of the far north so there is some sort of jurassic park style biology going on to bring back some of those species however there are situations where species go extinct in the wild but then can be reintroduced later after some sort of captive breeding project one of the most exciting to entomologists at least examples of this has to do with a creature called the tree lobster a giant stick insect found on lord howe island in the tasman sea and considered extinct for over a century until a few dozen individuals were found eeking out a tiny existence on a rocky spire just off the coast they were gathered they were bred in captivity and they now number in the thousands and biologists are just waiting for the day they can reintroduce them to lord howe island after they eradicate the rats that got them into trouble in the first place yourfriendtina asks why is wildlife conservation as a career kind of looking sexy rn well is it looking sexy thats great news for wildlife conservationists the field of wildlife conservation may appear sexy or may appear booming to you right now because its more important than ever before as wild areas and natural areas and biodiversity diminish the role of conserving whats left becomes more and more important and we do have some success stories to look to and to inspire us as well consider for example the california condor nearly extinct decades ago so rare that the last few individuals were trapped from the wild bread in

8roqqqaxW7c,the boys season 3 episode 1 recap  on set  entertainment weekly,Entertainment,hi there im anthony starr i play homelander on the boys this is going to be a pretty spoilerridden recap of certain episodes so if you dont want to have the show spoiled look away block your ears change the channel do whatever you got to do but do not watch the rest of you enjoy music the the show really starts with um pretty incredible piece of guest casting the charlize cameo came about by um following our usual pattern of cameos which is its the rigorous screening process of whoever returns seth rogens calls i think she you know talked to seth and evan they just made the long shot together talk about the definition of an incredible sport like shes like yeah ill do a favor for you and like great because its going to involve a superhero costume fitting coming out to simi valley for a full day shoot and reading the most ridiculous nazi dialogue ever with a straight face and totally nailing it and um and she was game for all of it so it was it was quite amazing there is uh uh theres actually an extended version of the charlize homelander scene um which will be on amazon xray uh when the first episode drops and theres even more ridiculous dialogue that we forced her to do so uh yeah tune in for that sadly we didnt get to we were never in the same spot at the same time we actually she shot her stuff in uh la and and we were up busy in toronto so uh so we were doing our stuff in toronto but youd never tell when you see it cut together and its just its its hysterical the whole setup and then it you know with homelanders coming in and talking to stormfront and youre sort of wondering whats going on and then turn around and uh the reveal of shelleys is is just hysterical and you know i mean shes such a great actor as well so its and she looks absurdly beautiful you know shes shelleys throne so its just such a uh surreal and its a its a cracking good opening to the show i thought it was so perfect because i also thought okay so shes being placed in this film thats also kind of a coverup for the fact that homelander fell for a nazi its one thing to be in a show with another actor and never meet them because you can have totally separate story lines that happened a lot during season one there were actors who like the boys i would never run into on set i would never see them it was like we were on a different show but this was we were all in the same scene as her and we never have even met her which is wild especially for anthony because he has an entire scene with her but it was hilarious and you know the funny thing is that we come in with these cheesy oneliners that also you know were were not actors were superheroes so we get to deliver them in a cheesier way than we would and to have license to do that is just kind of fun and to satirize like i dont know that whole world of studio films that are you know taking up the box office at this moment but it was great yeah i know its amazing i mean i saw i just saw doctor strange last week and when that cameo came up at the end i started giggling any time we can sort of inadvertently you know like duplicate whats happening in marvel im happy you know at the beginning of season three we find butcher in a pretty frustrated place there is a a real inertia uh that has transpired in his war against the seven and specifically homelander butcher feels like he is the only one who is actually acutely aware of the real position theyre in that everybody else is living in some kind of disneyland reality where butcher knows that theyre in a fight to the death and uh and and and playing by a set of rules that the other side arent going to adhere to is not in their best interest music hey theres a scene in episode one kimiko sees someone in at the party playing the piano and she sings and i think thats something uh the viewers will be surprised by because uh its the first time theyre hearing my voice and im actually singing um and it is a dream sequence but its what kimiko wants to be she wants to feel the connection with another human being so badly and communication is such a big part of that and currently she only has she only had it with kenji last season and then now she has it with frenchie but nobody else so that uh piano scene is um her longing to have a friend and her longing to be that girl on playing the piano my recollection is it was uh uh craig rosenberg who brought you such hits as dolphin through the windshield and plunging into the whale brought you um termite running up uh his lovers penis um its a very natural evolution um by the way because once you realize youre gonna do a tiny antman character you have to have that antman you know run up someones butt and then blow them up but then we realized that we already had blown up someones so its like theres only so many orifices a person can go in so its really by process of elimination stayed away from that set i didnt feel like that was something that i needed to uh to see and you know after working on the show for uh two seasons going into third season uh you come to uh build up a certain desensitization to to some of the more graphic content the termite scene is crazy because it happens all in the first 10 minutes of the show i think its before the credits and when to wear and i read this script we were just kind of blown away at how um how insane of a shot that was going to be they did such a wonderful job of like making it hilarious and also kind of tragic at the same time uh when termite sneezes and he explodes out of uh out of the guy he he has like this look of horror on his face and then frenchie comes in and hes like oh i didnt see anything im actually a little shocked how very little feedback we got from amazon on that one on the giant penis i think that i think weve worn them down and theyre and theyre just exhausted with us so its like easier to get things through they were totally cool with it i mean the the theres a standards rule which is actually quite amazing of like you know youre not supposed to show an erect penis so we had to be very careful with the design of the penis penis because we built it practically thats a real thats an 11 foot high 30 foot long penis built at great expense but if you look at it we had to design in all these wrinkles to make it clear that it wasnt erect so so anyway its exhibit 7023 why i love this job just the man who fell for the wrong woman uh for the wrong woman but out of i am very excited for everyone to meet the real me there is something wrong with homelander yeah homelanders mental state at the start of season three is is not good and i guess considering homelanders uh mental state generally is not very good its a its its a pretty its hes in a pretty bad place in season one pat oswald said anthony starr uh gives a smile like its a jump scare and that always that always feels that felt like a really apt description at the end of season two he really he really got dethroned i think everyones he felt very victimized and and ganged up on he lost the love what he perceived as the love of his life and maeve that hes got this very twisted relationship with but but i guess he sees her as an ally still turned on him and cahoots with starlight so hes really on the back foot having to do an apology tour and try and make up some ground for that pesky i went out for an i went out with a nazi thing thats been haunting him for uh well since since the end of season two which was a year before of course so hes in a really bad spot on the back foot and um desperately trying to claw his way to get some status back and really get back on his feet uh and then the delightful stan edgar presents a pretty big obstacle in that respect by by making starlight the cocaptain uh of the seven with him and thats something he never expected i dont have to tell you that our brand has been a bit tarnished since that nasty business last year but you have restored a wholesome trustworthy image to the company when we needed it the most which is why the board wants to make you music cocaptain of the seven what cocaptain my reaction to that moment when i read it in the script was this is gonna be fun because first of all i thought okay starlight is in for it because obviously homelander encompasses one of the concepts that weve drilled into this show which is that power corrupts and its corrupted him and hes gotten drunk on it and hes taken advantage of it and so my increase in power he sees as a threat to his own power and so while initially i take it as an opportunity to to uh you know maybe potentially seize more control in vaught maybe change things up a little bit maybe do some good you know i i really wanted homelander to feel like to borrow a metaphor from butcher scenes like a steam kettle starting to boil you know the most powerful man on the planet and hes like completely feels victimized all the time like certain former presidents but he finds a way to to turn it around you know that that old saying of keep your friends close and your enemies closer uh really rings true and so he flips it into a positive for himself and thinks right well if youre going to be right next to me then im going to make it the most uncomfortable experience of your potentially short life i realize i cant really do that because it has um ignited him and angered and provoked him so much that hes just manipulating me constantly has me under his thumb and i kind of feel at any moment hes about to laser me so its a kind of be careful what you wish for a moment no i didnt i didnt tell aya at the end of season two shed be coming back i think um we had to still sort of figure it out i mean we we very intentionally left her alive and wanted her to be a player in there you know um one way or another im not sure we totally knew how yet um but shes the best and you know i i id bring her back you know just to hang out with her yeah thats what that thats been the toughest ive been like oh no i having to stop myself revealing that because um its such a funny little uh cameo should we call it uh its its one of the stranger cameos that youll see uh i think on television basically shes ive been keeping her a little bit like boxing helena remember that movie um but shes basically she hasnt got any legs anymore shes got one good arm which she and i have found a way to use to uh release home release home lenders tensions uh which we do on screen and its it was actually one of the funniest days ive had shooting because they got a prosthetic in in place for her to use uh to get the motion right but i couldnt i kept laughing i could have kept breaking because it was i kept looking down and i couldnt look down so i was looking up and then and unable to look at what was going oh it was just so ridiculous the whole thing is so absurd but um you know it just goes to show what a beautiful deep connection they really had i think the nice thing about miles um i think the nice thing about him coming into the mix is that he represents the old annie and while i think that um the old annie to me is honestly fraught with lies because obviously my upbringing or what i believe to be my upbringing was totally dishonest in terms of what my mother told me and how i got my superpowers and the abandonment of my father but but i think that its always nice to have someone enter your life who knows you from before any type of notoriety or popularity or celebrity happened and i think that thats a reprieve for her to have someone from her hometown that knows the old annie you know and i think that while she did go through uh an identity crisis when she found out that her mom had lied to her um all of her life i think at the same time that old annie to a certain degree is her true self shes trying to be that old annie while also being the newly evolved annie and i think that he makes her feel a little safer in this chaotic environment music i really wanted to shoot a fight scene um this season and we spent about six weeks uh choreographing that fight so we came in every every week or so for a couple of hours and we rolled around on the floor um uh struggling and it was amazing and the entire team uh led by john kayama was just phenomenal and i had so much fun doing it i mean the actual night of the shoot im used to having blood on on me on this show now so im like that was nothing but we were very much uh rolling around on the floor and a lot of like fake blood was reaching my hair and so that at the end of that evening i was i left set with just like chunks of my hair ripped out of my head which all grew back on us and it looks great it was great but that was a that was an intense night temp v doesnt exist in the comic actually in the comic the boys really from the beginning like just all shoot up compound v and theyre just superheroes and seth evan and i really from day one one of the first choices we made was that we didnt want to do that because i think it takes something away from the underdog you know thing of of these like guys who are completely outmatched by literally super powered individuals but you have to figure out how to bring them down with your wits and we never wanted to lose that and so you know it was time to you know nod to that storyline in the comic in in in season three um but i you know i did it with a lot of handwringing i was worried i you know i i was like i dont im really nervous about you know with the dna of the show um and so through a lot of conversation we sort of landed on this you know temporary compound v that has its own side effects and is really unstable and you know costs so much to emotionally and physically to use it so then we could get into once we started talking about it as a drug metaphor and like a heroin metaphor and that i had an escape hatch that i could i could make them normal again when i needed it um you know then i kind of came around to the idea we had this really interesting scene take shape where where these guys that really hate each other but ultimately in a very twisted way uh very much need each other theyre both at the bottom theyre both on the bottom rung of their own personal ladders and they really need each other and just got those beats before of like you know carl really butcher really playing uh playing it cool even though hes got hes just hidden this v this uh temp v so hes actually bricking it but hes uh hes playing it cool and you can see homeland is sort of looking around at the hole that hes living in wow hes really hes really fallen from grace hes really you know hes really in a bad spot which i dont think he anticipated he had a hunch but seeing is believing you know theres going to be one of them left standing uh and you know again i just i just love the fact that everybody else is happy in the show but homelander and butcher and the fact that they conspire to uh to shake up the world and get things back on that a more chaotic track i just love that so hes very aware that hes hes getting squeezed and pushed into it into a corner and the only way out of that corner bizarrely for both of them is with william uh so he goes he turns up and um they have this very interesting little chat where they they kind of make a death pact ill inspire you you inspire me well get back to strength and then we will fight like cats and dogs well its almost like brothers you know they theyll have a a fight to the death blood and bone shock and all sort of thing and um that becomes i think for the characters um kind of at least for my character for homelander im not going to speak for carl but it becomes a driving force for the season music
4Ugl6ydSglA,art laffer this is moving in the wrong direction,Art,thats my riff joining me now with great pleasure we bring in art laffer former reagan advisor presidential dal medal recipient and author of taxes have consequences indeed they do steve moore committee for prosperity freedom works author of govzilla steve more i begin with you we have met the enemy and the enemy is us when you look at the numbers when you look at the numbers right now russia has recovered most of its oil production and we are still over a mill barrels short the energy information administration says we would be up to 13 14 15 million barrels gasoline production is down even gasoline inventories are down thats why i say we have met the enemy and the enemy is us steve moore i ask you why is biden still blaming putin i mean blame putin for a lot of things but energy the problem is here with the war against fossils  i will say it again that month that donald trump left office we actually were exporting we were a net exporter of oil and gas as you know larry we now have to actually import it it is really humiliating frankly we have to go to other countries like saudi arabia and beg them to increase their oil output i think you put it very well i cant improve what you said larry if anything you understate the issue when we were producing that 12 million barrels a day under trump the price of oil at that time was somewhere between 60 and 65 a barrel im looking on the screen right now i see the price is 120 a barrel this is incredibly price sensitive issue every time the price goes up they would increase drilling i think at the very minimum we would be at 15 million barrels a day we could be a lot higher than that just one last point do the math here if lets say the price of 100 a barrel and were lets say 2 million below where we should be were talking about billions and billions of dollars per week that were losing as a country because were not producing oil and gas were not consuming less it is just were not getting from texas oklahoma and alaska larry you know art laffer look we can blame putin for a lot of things lord knows the guy is a war criminal terrorist corrupt all the rest of it but art if terms of the world oil shortage that includes the gasoline shortage we are the problem we in the us are the problem as you always say tax something and you get less of it i just want to add to that regulate something and you get less of it overregulation of fossil fuels has created this shortage and high prices which are killing consumers and real wages  youre completely correct again but you know one thing that janet yellen made the comment about inflation is a worldwide phenomenon therefore it is not our problem the whole world community is operating here larry it is our problem the thing is were exporting this problem to other countries as well the oil crisis we precipitated prices of energy we have exported to all the other countries having horrible times as well it is not just us were doing damage to it is they too just to mention they talk about this waffle biden economy how were growing like mad do you realize today we have 800000 less jobs than we had in february of 2001 800000 less jobs were over five 12 million jobs below where we would have been had we stayed on trend the first quarters gdp was minus 1 12 this quarters gdp has been revised from 13 to now 9 you know all of this is moving in the wrong direction and we are the precipitators we are the problems here period larry art laffer by the by on that point go to steve moore on this seems very excited about it steve sorry core inflation core inflation is i dont know half in europe what it is here so that is a big difference europe has high inflation because they buy all their oil and gas pro russia i get that but core inflation is much lower in europe than it is here so that puts another lie to the biden arguments and by the by our fiscal stimulus this is from jason furman you know was a obamaclinton economist a smart guy straightshooter our fiscal stimulus was much more substantial than europes fiscal stimulus so even that argument breaks down basically every argument breaks down  yeah as ways mentioning to you earlier today larry im actually testifying before the house budget committee because arthur laffer wouldnt go i am taking his place larry who else wouldnt go in who else wouldnt go who else wouldnt go  democrats are having a hearing basically the theme of the hearing is that they think that its a celebration of the biden economy can you imagine this they want to celebrate how well bidens policies and his fiscal stimulus worked one other quick point i dont believe joe biden or the democrats or their leftwing enviros when they complain about high gas prices larry they want high gas prices they hate this industry they want them out of business remember the debate biden had with trump biden said i want to put this industry out of business if you want to do that a good way to shrink its out put larry shrink its out put there is better way supply side growth outlook outlined this trump tax cuts permanent broader simpler tax code simplification deregulate energy across the board everywhere go back to deregulation art freeze domestic spending protect king dollar wrap it up into a balanced budget plan that is bare bones type stuff but you can add to it you can subtract to it but to me this is the kind of plan that the senators and the house members and the gop should be running on  yeah theyre the five grand kingdoms of macro economics larry and you hit them there broad base low rate flat tax spending restraint sound money minimal regulations freer trade that is the package right there were looking at this i would love to see the trump tax cuts made permanent i dont think there is a chance in heck that happens i would love to see king dollar brought back there is not a chance they will happen with this fed larry we have a long slog you look at powell rest of the fed members they really dont know what theyre doing they have to be panicked today what did the rate go up 340 345 it is way too low it has to go a lot higher im with you 100 on the goals the dreams the north store but we have a long way to go to have the calvary bring it back home to rest hows that larry thats very good by the way  thank you larry steve makes important point stocks down almost 900 points stocks are getting clobbered right now okay that is a recession signal but usually at least lately when stocks go down the 10year interest rate goes down that is not happening the 10year interest rate popped way up to whatever it is 340 and stuff and inflation expectations in the tips market are looking the same steve im thinking these are signals of inflationary recession and i dont think we can get out of this without a recession but i think the real killer will be inflationary recession because of what art just said it is not likely let me ask you steve why not raise 100 basis points 100 basis points in june 100 basis points in july 100 basis points in september until we see these price indexes coming down now will the fed do that will they take that action  well you know im in full agreement with you and art laffer were on capitol hill today we were recommending exactly that you have to keep raising rates until you start  we cannot go forward with an 8 12 10 inflation rate it will kill economy kill family incomes were looking right now larry if this inflation continues at this pace well see the biggest decline in real family income in 21 and 22 weve seen in many many years because peoples wages cant keep pace tough do something about the supply side the thing that worries me the most people are in a panic consumer confidence is way way down small business confidence is down investor confidence is down and tell me one thing that joe biden has said over the last two months that is inspired confidence in this great economy of ours nothing larry two months two months how about 18 months  18 months larry where did you get two months you were on the hill too long today  the market melted down ways praying art laffer that he would pull a bill clinton but he is not doing it  no he is not doing it at all when you look at it it is just i dont see how we get out of it with biden there reagan said it correctly when you lose your job it is depression when the other spy loses his job it is recession when biden loses his job it will be prosperity that is the true picture we cant deal with these people they are incompetent larry but art last word to you i think it is important that the gop senate candidates house candidates i think they have to have a growth message not a root canal message in other words recession may be inevitable perhaps but i think you have to show a plan a strategy okay a blueprint that is progrowth and antiinflation at the same time  yes larry you get the last word  yeah i agree with you totally we just cant run against biden against democrats in congress we have to run for something what you said earlier low rate broadbased flat tax spending restraint impounding funds already authorized not been spent doing that sound money i dont know how we do that with this fed deregulation we can do that by the trump plans on that bring back oil all of that and lastly free trade larry youve always been the massive champion of free trade you and steve and are really big free traders i join you in that 100 larry im totally free trade dot dot dot except when it comes to china just going to make that point because china will never be reciprocal they will keep their trade barriers tough hammer them on general grounds economic and national security rest of free trade absolutely right we all opposed steel and aluminum tariffs that was not president trumps best policy i got to get out of here i just think we have to have a progrowth solution to this inflationary recession thats before us that is what the stock markets now telling us
5s4_cX3To8Y,jurgen klopp calls sadio mane a modernday liverpool icon as striker completes move to bayern munich,Sport,now sadie amane admits he didnt have to think twice when presented with the opportunity to leave liverpool for bayern munich after completing his 35 million pounds move he revealed that jurgen klopp wanted him to stay at anfield but couldnt persuade him because he wanted a new challenge after six years at the club he didnt even think twice i just accepted and for me like i said is i had offers my agent but i choose bayern because i think its the right club and i was really really and im still really happy to be part of this big club i think i spent of course six wonderful years in liverpool and with very very very nice people and very great friends and of course like i said of course i was not happy and but its a part of life in myself i i need and spend in probably in general last six eight years and a new new challenge and like i said now bayern was for me the right club yeah club is club you know him very good guy and of course he would love me to stay but of course i think like i said very very great guy he understand my institution like the club and they accept and yeah i wish of course all the best well mohamed salah tweeted tuitions former forward partner the very best by saying its been quite a ride thank you for all the good times and i wish you the best in your new adventure you will be missed by all of us well following confirmation of the deal jurgen klopp has also paid tribute to monet describing him as a legend but also a modern day liverpool icon well klopp said its a big moment theres no point in anyone trying to pretend otherwise one of liverpools greatest ever players is leaving and we must acknowledge how significant this is he leaves with our gratitude and our love the goals he scored the trophies he won a legend for sure but also a modern day liverpool icon i respect completely his decision and im sure our supporters do also if you love lfc you have to love sadio nonnegotiable it is possible to do this while accepting our losses bayerns game we wish him nothing but success in every match he plays in unless of course its against us his start will continue to rise i have no doubts well our senior reporter melissa reddy has joined me on set melissa nice to see you this evening all right whats his legacy then at liverpool i think he will be remembered as the first transformer of the jurgen klopp era the spark that started it all that spelled the change in liverpools playing style their desire to be back amongst the elite to be a domestic powerhouse and a european powerhouse he joined and got them back into champions league football scored incredibly vital goals on their route to winning the trophy in 2019 the first piece of silverware of the club era and then went on and won everything he possibly could win at the club so this fresh challenge makes a lot of sense i think when describing him though its not just about the goals he scored and the creative output he worked tirelessly off the pitch he was incredibly low maintenance very humble was always willing to be in the shadows or take a seat and allow somebody else to shine remember when he joined liverpool he played as the right attacker when mohamed salah joined because that was his favorite position he switched to the left and was remarkable there and then ended up exiting liverpool as their false nine their focal point and he was great there as well so jurgen klopp has called him a legend a modern day icon so what does this transfer say about liverpool i think the fact that he leaves in the height of his career still you know hes a ballon dor candidate hes done exceptionally well on the international stage as well hes going to a powerhouse in bayern munich and yet for all he contributed to liverpool and the affection that obviously the the coaching staff the players the supporters have for him this doesnt feel like the end of days it doesnt feel detrimental and thats a credit to liverpools quiet evolution of their forward line they dont want the players to age altogether so they brought in jota gradually then diaz and now darwin nunes and you know the front three have been really helpful in the fact that theyve set the standards theyve allowed these players to come in and and settle immediately because of what theyve managed to do these players are not under pressure because of the front three still being there and i just think liverpools recruitment staff have earned so much credit because of the way theyve handled the incomings and so such a significant outgoing jurgen klopps own words doesnt really feel that way theres another argument though isnt there liverpool played in three cup finals last season didnt score a goal theyve got this much vaunted front three or front five whatever you want to call them they scored fewer goals than the champions who played without a recognized striker so did liverpool actually have to make these changes and freshen things up i dont think the changes are necessitated by the three finals and not scoring a goal they contributed i think 58 shots in those three finals and all the analytics will tell you it was probably more likely to score 15 goals from that 58 from those specific 58 shots than it was to score zero so liverpool and we credit their recruitment stuff theyre not making massive decisions based on three games the evolution is natural because you have to stay a step ahead you have to keep transitioning you cannot have an old forward line especially with the demands clock places on them in a physical aspect and as great as that front three have been you cannot be sentimental about it the games changing you have to evolve and liverpool have gradually done that and ultimately youll see the fading away of roberta for mena we know mohamed salah has a year left of his contract he said hes staying the summer but perhaps next season he wants to leave on a free and so liverpool have to consider this theyve got remarkable service from those three and they have allowed as i said the new attackers to come in and have this incredible structure and template to work off but ultimately liverpool need to keep it moving and i think these decisions allowing him to leave with gratitude and best wishes and and rejigging that attack is just imperative to them staying in competition with like you say city who did so well without a recognized striker and now and got the the player we all expect to be the future ballon dor dominant force in that sure lets broaden this a little bit same most alar you say a year on his contract can you envisage a time when liverpool sell him to manchester united or to manchester city so what im saying is do the top premier league clubs have to sell to each other more i think that definitely has to happen in terms of premier league clubs doing more deals with each other especially rivals for players of office team and one of the examples well use is raheem sterling chelsea being very interested in him and manchester city having to think to themselves well we need to allow perhaps that departure because the fees these players are on and and the transfer figures they would command the rest of europe cannot compete with with premier league sides at present so those deals i think are going to become commonplace the salah situation in particular hes cant keep leaking that his preference is to stay in the premier league and and thats what it like now on liverpools end they see that very much as a negotiating tactic because if were being honest where could he possibly go that that meets these ambitions and stuff in the league city while i think clubs have to become better at selling to each other i dont think those two who see themselves a little bit separately from the rest they know they are each others real competitors they are the benchmark setters i dont think deals between these two happen but in general with leeds and arsenal as were seeing with the ruffinia interest but specifically with that sterling deal i think will trigger a state of play where premier league clubs just understand theyre going to get better at negotiating with each other so are you saying then that manchester city dont see chelsea as that much of a rival at the moment that they can sell one of their best players to them i think they know if they would allow sterling to exit to chelsea and we have to state actually that theres been no formal approach from chelsea yet and no concrete talks with the player or anything like that but hypothetically if they let sterling go to chelsea that strengthens chelsea right it closes the gap a little bit but still in saying that if chelsea are the only club seriously coming in for him because like we say the other european clubs cant afford the salary transfer fee cant really compete with their premier league counterparts then you know city have two way up do we keep him and let him go for free next summer like what is the winning scenario and so ultimately the teams have to become used to comfortable with and more acute at negotiations with their rivals intra transfer melissa reddy senior reporter thank you very much music
T-JVpKku5SI,the problem of education inequality  cnbc reports,Education,malcolm x once said that “education is the passport to the future” but what if some passports are better than others giving the holder access to better schools and teachers and in turn a more prosperous future these inequalities have been around long before covid19 and yet the pandemic has both exacerbated them and made them more visible while the standard of education varies greatly globally education inequality happens at the local level in all countries for example only four out of every 100 children in africa is expected to enter a graduate and postgraduate institution compared to 14 out of 100 in south and west asia and 36 out of 100 in latin america even in developed countries the quality of schooling can differ greatly whether rich or poor high national wealth then is no guarantee of high equality the uk germany and the us are among the richest countries in the world but all three rank poorly on an educational inequality league table of 41 of the world’s richest countries by the middle of secondary school educational inequalities are worse than in other countries with much smaller economies such as latvia spain and estonia however research has shown that child development is linked with income unsurprisingly the us and the uk have some of the highest levels of income inequality among oecd countries in the uk there has been a significant lack of social mobility since 1945 as wealth inequality has remained high there hasn’t been much change in how well british children are doing at school in a 2019 report by the education coalition fair education alliance pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds in the uk lag their peers by more than 8 months in reading writing and maths by age 11 children from persistently disadvantaged backgrounds are 22 months behind by the time they finish their school career small progress has been made in helping some children almost beat the odds and overcome the barriers that face them but the systemic underlying factors of our education system still remain which mean we’re not ever reaching the most persistently disadvantaged so what are the contributing factors of education inequality among children according to unicef a child’s educational progress is linked to their family background what kind of jobs the parents have or whether the child is a first generation immigrant can affect the likelihood of them continuing into higher education inequality between genders is also apparent from a young age and tends to grow as children get older reading abilities among girls are generally better than boys by the age of nine and in turn that discrepancy is more likely to continue in education beyond secondary school and finally which school you go to can have a significant impact on your academic performance in many countries the debate on inequality in education is seen through the prism of private schools versus state schools the uk is home to some very famous private schools like eton college and harrow school behind me of the 55 british prime ministers nearly half were educated at just these two schools along with prominent actors writers scientists and royalty from across the world to compare the entire state school education in england of a young person starting from nursery costs an average of around 96000 the annual school fees at harrow however cost around 56000 for just one year of a child’s tuition but even that is dwarfed by private schools in switzerland such as le rosey which costs more than 135000 per year many believe that private education is at the root of inequality and reduces the chances for those children who attend state schools the statistics tell us that educational privilege provides significant advantages and opens many doors in the uk nearly a third of members of parliament twothirds of the country’s top doctors and 74 of judges were privately educated the exam results also reflect the disparity in 2019 457 of students at private schools in the uk got a or as in their final year exams compared to the national average of 255 but there are some state funded schools that buck that trend this is mulberry school for girls in east london it’s located in one of the most disadvantaged areas in the city yet the exam performance of students here is well above national average vanessa ogden is the headteacher here and for the last 15 years has been instrumental in seeing many of her pupils overturn the odds as a headteacher how do you in your role help to tackle education inequality the first really important way is to have students leave with a really great set of qualifications and really great destinations to either university or apprenticeships and so that’s the driving force but of course inequality brings with it many structural difficulties in your life but while the pupils at mulberry school have outperformed their peers for many years the covid19 pandemic may have undone much of that work we know from the research that covid19 has disproportionately affected people of black asian and minority ethnic background and those are the families mainly that we serve and so not only has there been real difficulty around finance and resources but also real difficulty around health the very first thing that reared its head was period poverty female students not being able to get sanitary products we hadn’t realized that really in a way schools are the providers of some of those things stationery as well so if you don’t have money or if the shops are shut and you don’t have stationery in the home and we lent out all the devices that we could so that they could learn at home in terms of the reasons why covid19 has exacerbated the disadvantage gap one big reason is the digital divide but it’s also a resource divide in general so some families might not have access to laptops to access online learning they might not have a lot of space the little progress we have made over the last ten years is likely to have been reversed by lockdown so what was already a dire situation has been turned into quite a crisis the pandemic also highlighted another aspect of education inequality private tuition by midapril there were nationwide school closures in more than 190 countries affecting more than 15 billion learners this led to an unprecedented demand for online teaching some online tutoring platforms saw the number of daily users increase by 1125 in two weeks in singapore there have even been calls to ban the private tuition industry in an attempt to close the achievement gap the covid19 pandemic also impacted students in the uk progressing to university due to exams being canceled during the lockdown results were given based on an algorithm that critics claimed dragged dow highachieving pupils in lowachieving schools compounding the inequalities they face the department of education and the exam boards initially responded by claiming there was no bias whether on the grounds of deprivation gender or ethnicity however they eventually reversed their decision with grades instead estimated by the students’teachers so what can be done to reduce educational inequalities both here and around the world a former singaporean education minister said in 2018 that there should be a broader definition of merit to recognize a wider range of skills we should double up on meritocracy broaden its definition to embrace various talents and skills we should not cap achievement at the top but try harder work harder to lift the bottom the fair education alliance also believes there is too much reliance on exams and that education should be more holistic to include building aptitude and values we want an education system which develops skills and social and emotional competencies alongside academic attainment we want teachers and leaders to be rewarded for serving the most disadvantaged students we want to engage parents and communities from all backgrounds in the education system and we want to prepare young people for what comes after school education is a way out of difficult situations it’s also a means of moving yourself up the tree in terms of prosperity and not just financial prosperity but also your kind of spiritual and cultural prosperity as well it’s also the case that a policy that works in one country or region may not work in another economic inequality however is likely to grow due to the covid 19 pandemic this means that creating better education systems is increasingly important so that a child’s starting point in life doesn’t determine their future you have to be an optimist otherwise you’d pack up and go home in education you know you have to believe there is hope hi guys thanks for watching our video i’d like to know how your schooling has affected your future what are the education systems like in the country you live in comment below the video to let us know

4hEDKbUk03k,talking tech with google ceo sundar pichai,Tech,im so excited to be here with you when i first started my youtube channel before that i saw the movie the internship in like 2013 and my dream job was to work at google so this feels like a really full circle moment thank you so much well youre close to where the google headquarters is yeah crazy yeah we did a tour yesterday and we saw like all these incredible venues and like the mini kitchens this collaborative culture which i think was a really big thing precovered how have you guys kind of looked at being like the pioneer of like this hybrid work model because i think before code you guys were like the pioneer like youre it um and now youre getting back a little bit but what do you think the future is going to look like with work thats such a good question uh you know there are people who like i got an email from someone yesterday saying they went for a run around the same loop they always run and it felt so good to be back and you know i think people people do need those connections and and but what we are embracing is flexibility uh i think people have gotten used to a more flexible life and i think init is uh you know as google one of the things weve always weve trusted our employees weve given them a lot of agency and so we want to give them the flexibility so that youre not too stressed if you have a doctor appointment or you have to show up at your kids parents conference or whatever it is but we expect people to come you know three days a week and but you know well be flexible overall and i think its exciting so we can rethink our work spaces a bit make sure when people are coming together it is more meaningful youre actually coming to spend time and connect with people too so thats the opportunity are you in the office now like full time uh well not full time i also im taking advantage of the flexible thing which i announced so you know but im coming in about three days a week okay nice and so what do you think like what activities are good in person that you maybe cant replicate online oh i mean just going to the cafe yeah grabbing food and sitting outside and then suddenly somebody from some other team comes and joins and you know then talking to people about what theyre working or even their life i think that serendipitous uh meandering stuff which you end up discovering i think its so much tougher to do that over video for sure and also if youre rolling up your sleeves and brainstorming and working you know i think i think for sure i think theres like a huge intangible happiness increase by just being with people which we kind of experienced today at i o the first one back um what was that like for you like with the live audience being back in person yeah i mean i i got a bit surprised on stage the first time people i applaud it because then i you know because i i lost that sense for about two to three years and so you know it took me a while to kind of work my way through i felt like im readjusting back to the real world yeah its nice the energy you feel and you know i think many people feel that too and you can see people are enjoying being back uh so hopefully we all can build on it and keep moving forward yeah and so you got guys announced you give an early look at the pixel 7 and then we have the 6a the pixel watch i feel like were really moving towards like this bigger ecosystem build how do you look at googles building the ecosystem i feel like youre in a really unique spot with being like an android like giving android to a lot of other oems and theyre all building their own ecosystems how do you think google differentiates like the pixel ecosystem from like just android as a whole you know the power of android is people can take and take it in many different directions right and so it makes it flexible what im excited about google doing hardware is we get to express our view endtoend view on how we want that experience to work and you know if you if you think about our vision of we want to make sure devices kind of are seamlessly working together there to help you not get in the way so that youre not dealing with things trying to fix things to do that well you need to have an endtoend view and and thats what we are doing so for me this has been a long journey but to see a whole portfolio of products uh being able to put it together and make sure theyre all working together a phone a watch a tablet and and underneath all that is ai and working uh across and the fact we are investing all the way down to our own silicon which now will work across all our products wow i think i think you know its just a big big opportunity yeah so speaking of ai i think thats one of the things that youve really like brought to the forefront when you became ceo and one of the things i really admire about you is how youve done it in like a really ethical way and you kind of think about what the adverse effects could be of introducing ai there was so much ai today from like the google translate to the glasses that i think are gonna like change peoples lives they come to fruition with the live translate um what ai projects to you do you feel like arent covered enough but are like really exciting that youre um so to be working on at the core you know the essence of what youre seeing is making sure computers can like understand the world around the way humans do be able to see things look you know hear things and get context its hard for computers to do so thats what a lot of the ai work we are we are doing is we spoke a little bit about language models today and and you know and they are getting more capable we have a lot of important areas to work through uh but the potential of that is what we try to show right the fact that you in your hands can have access to something which is knowledgeable on any topic or can imagine with you learn new things uh i i think i think that there is so so much potential on that so you know thats something i think its not often talked about but its an exciting part of what were working on yeah i went to a press briefing with you guys a few weeks ago and it was talking a lot about like the flood detection and how many lives and like people that has really saved and i think when people think of google they think like search and android and docs and like all these things that really affect our lives but there are so many other things that you guys are working on even street view just had their 15year anniversary that project has completely changed the world is there something with maps and street view that youre still expanding with because today in the briefing you talked a little bit about africa yeah well two things first of all were bringing immersive view in maps so i think the real power of like thinking about a place seeing it as you would see it in real life including checking the inside of a hotel or a restaurant out anytime you want i think its going to be very powerful and again that in the context of a different form factor in the future is the real potential of what we are uh what we are building what do you mean like in the ar glasses having that access to a immersive view uh so that if youre looking at a place youre looking at a restaurant if you want to you can say what the inside of it looks like or you know what the menu is and you know i think shows the power of power of all this but you know you brought up an important point which is access you want to make sure this all works everywhere in the world which is why were mapping buildings in africa using ai to map it better yeah creating a data set opening up that data center including organizations like world bank and united nations so they can do important work with it so all that is part of the work we are doing how do you approach like what ai you like really work on and what doesnt maybe come to fruition because im sure people pitch you like a lot of different projects like magic eraser i think is one that like makes complete sense and its worked really well and then yesterday on our tour there was um google lens where we saw a robot in one of the spots were like what is this and it immediately came up how do you kind of figure out what projects are the most meaningful with the ai i mean we have i mean the test i use is is this if by creating a feature with this is it going to be helpful i think about it four dimensions is going to help people improve their knowledge success health or happiness okay if it fits one of those four attributes i think its good to do so thats thats kind of how i think about it and if i feel its not doing any of that you know i would question as to why we are adding that yeah but thats the bar with which we think about everything we do and i think globally too youve talked in the past about like your moonshot goal of being carbon free by 2030 how do you approach like climate change and all the other things thats like a giant corporation because and i watched an interview that you did with stanford and you were talking about how a lot of the times like youll approach a project if you think that google could be the right fit and kind of advance it how do you look at like being carbon frame oh you know its its the most important thing uh you know i think we could be working on i think your generation is going to hold all of us accountable yeah if you dont make progress there and and you know as a company we bet on wind and solar early and over 10 years its become more mainstream to really run 24 7 carbon free everywhere in the world yeah we have to solve this everywhere look at new sources of energy we now have a data center with geothermal we are looking at technologies like carbon capture and and so remember we cannot do it with offsets this is to say 24 7 every search you do every youtube video every gmail yeah you know works carbon free and and and so thats a big goal yeah but as a technologist im excited because that allows us to invest develop new technologies which can then make its way into the world and sustainability is something in which uh uh you know i think um we want to make sure were bringing all our resources as a company to make a difference yeah youre like just so incredibly impressive and todays google i o is amazing thank you so much for your time well thanks thanks for taking the time im inspired by your story keep doing what youre doing thank you thank you all right thanks jacqueline youre so great thank you music you

MutyT341KUo,astros vs mets game highlights 62822  mlb highlights,Game,thats got swept for the first time last week in houston with the astros taking both games and theyll be up against carlos carrasco who got shelled early against the astros in houston before leaving with lower back tightness well they jumped him for four runs in the first inning hes looking for a little redemption leading off and he checks his swing or does it yes he does says first base umpire chris siegel and altuve draws a walk on a check swing nobody out here is jeremy pena the shortstop right and battery chops one to short the door up with it shovels to second one mcneil the first got him double play six four three omar lopez says he may want to look at that one again and dusty baker is going to want them to look at this it looked like originally he was in there foot on the bag ball not yet in the back of the glove and that would tell you that hopefully here in new york they do overturn that as review the call is overturned the runner is saved houston retains her challenge so carrasco merely gets the first out of the night on the 64 fielders choice and the astros have a firstinning threat first and third and one out alex bregman in the fourth spot bregman lines one to right field pretty well hit martay on the move he wont get there jordan alvarez with a great read will get to third martay almost caught up with that line drive but jordan knew off the bat it was going to be down for a hit and goes first to third and bregman drives in the run to make it one nothing so far tonight three of the first four astros have reached and runners at the corners with one out for kyle tucker and tucker belts this one deep to right center field and you can kiss that one goodbye end of the mets bullpen a threerun home run for kyle tucker and the astros go up four to nothing the astros jump on carlos carrasco for a second straight time early on in the city of queens the king has shown up robert valdez

yankee stadium but start the opening game here in new york against the mets on the season a 290 era brandon nemo is going to lead off swing and a miss good morning good afternoon and good night brandon nemo got him on the cutter and there is one away martay drives one out to ryan and tucker will watch it go over his head off the base of the wall it sticks there for a moment and martine pulls into second base with a one out double two so alonso will be next slowly hit queued towards the middle of the diamond good play by pena the spin and throw in time pena makes a great play up the middle to get alonzo for the final out of the inning excellent play by penis showing off his reigns jeff mcneal will have a chance to lead off if neil had missed a handful of games because of hamstring tightness and he immediately hits one the other way for a base hit so jeff picks up right where he left off start of the day third in the national league hitting 327 and he has to that james mccann will be the banner now graviton short the astros can return the favor and they do pena to altuve to guriel and james mccann hits into a double play fromer can roll them up this pitch is deep center back onto myers onto the warning track and he makes the catch about 380 feet third walk of the game for carrasco gotta bring up mccormick runner goes pitches a strike throw down safe head first slide by tucker james mccann with that great arm behind the plate the catcher buck showalter says continue play so thats the 14th stolen base of the season for tucker in 15 attempts 22 pitch swinging a roller toward the left side handled by escobar with a belt high hop his throw to first is accurate to retire chas mccormick two outs holding at second base tucker the batter will be jake myers 20 pitches a line drive base hit to center field kyle tucker will score jake myers a twoout rbi single astros lead this game five to nothing two out rbis and suck the life out of a team its alonso the major leagues rbi leader 69 runs batted in hes got a chance with runner at second marte and the runner at first lindor ground ball right side altuve a diving stop hell get up to make the play and get alonzo at first base great diving play by jose altuve for the first half only play he had that was gorgeous by altuve he raised six steps to his left to come up with it into the grass yeah he was shaded up the middle its close to second base so had to go quite a ways to get to that now two in scoring position the infield back with a fivenothing lead and valdez will work out of the full windup to jd davis swing at a miss he got a big strikeout for proper valdez getting jd davis for the second out davis swung right over the top of it and for valdez thats strikeout number three escobar draws a walk the second of the inning issued by valdez marcano will have a chance the bases loaded and two outs as the mets trail five to nothing swings its a grounder to bregman at third a tough two hop and he goes to second for the force and thats going to do it for the mets thats now all for five with runners in scoring position penalty second with one out alvarez with three infielders to the right of second three home runs last week for alvarez against the mets and alvarez hits it in the air pretty deep to center going back on it is nimble on the warning track at the wall see you later youre done alvarez air your dog with number 23 sails one towards laguardia to give the astros a seven nothing lead is it 23 homers this year nine in the month of june alone four of them now against the mets so tucker reaches on the fielders choice and there are two away heres julie guriel who lined out to deep right as last time and uriel hits it pretty deep to left field going back on it is canna at the wall looking up see a ladder two two run home runs in the inning for the astros as yuli has found some life in the bat here in new york newly with a fivegame hitting streak at the big apple connecting on his sixth home run its now nine to nothing astros valdez is working on a streak of 11 consecutive quality starts which is the longest current streak in the majors hes certainly on pace to do that again tonight one out and one on for jd davis this one towards short could be too pain it to diaz and a led miss with the throw to first for the double play fromer has done it again his 13th double play behind him this year his second tonight from valdez back out there six shutout innings so far the astros nine runs on ten hits two away here in the seventh to two got him strike three on the pitch away and mcneal goes down on strikes a one two three for valdez valdez has gone seven scoreless innings and the mets get a two out base runner smith down goes dom smith robert valdez makes quick work of the pinch hitter one man left on base a smile on roberts base as he is through eight shutout innings lets see if somebody can get jordan alvarez out hes been on base four straight times today that ball is rope to center field hes on base for a fifth time jordan alvarez continuing to torment the mets three for three with two walks have yourself a knight now jj manichevik will take his turn thats lined and caught escobar with a beautiful play to take a base it away from matajevic and that ends the inning and the mets have two on with nobody out in the bottom of the ninth and over toward the left field line over is mccormick will he have room against the wall reaches into the seats and makes the catch tremendous play by mccormick he was leaping as that sidewall was angling upward he left against that sidewall reached into the seats and came up with the baseball thatll load up the bases here with two out and now james mccann comes to the plate three two coming and its high ball four and now the fans are happy the mets have scored a run the houston lead is cut to nine to one and the bases remain loaded as ender and ciarte will be the better ground ball weekly hit right side

-fizUVHGHsg,self confidence  morning motivation  motivational speech,Motivation,you see what happens is this then that an individual who all his life long  has played the social game then says well now ive done that i have assumed this role i have become identified  with tinker tailer soldier sailer whatever it was   but now who am i  really in order to find that out i have to go off by myself  why because   you have a role conception  a mask conception of yourself  because other people tell you who you are if belief is a construct than like any other construct  it can be manipulated and changed and at any moment  you can choose to believe something new about yourself now the weird thing about belief is  as soon as you change that belief it becomes true why that is i will never quite understand what weird quirk of human evolution has left us in a space where simply believing it makes it true if you think youre dumb guess what youre dumb and you will act in accordance with that belief  and that should scare the sht out of you so if you think about it people wake up in the morning they begin to think about their problems those problems are circuits memories in the brain each one of those memories are connected to people  and things at certain times and places and if the brain is a record of the past the moment they start their day theyre already thinking in the past  each one of those memories has emotions emotions are the end product of past experiences so the moment they recall those memories of their problems  they all of a sudden feel unhappy they feel sad they feel pain now how you think and how you  feel creates your state of being  so the persons entire state of being  when they start their days in the past so what does that mean the familiar past will sooner or later be predictable future so if you believe that your thoughts have something to do with your destiny and you cant think greater than how you feel  or feelings have become the means of thinking  by very definition of emotions youre thinking in the past   and for the most part youre going to keep creating the same life so then people grab their cell phone they check their whatsapp they check their texts they check their emails they check facebook they take a picture  they post it on facebook they tweet something they do instagram they check the news and now they feel really connected to everything thats known in their life and then they go through a series of routine behaviors they get out of bed on the same side they go to the toilet they get a cup of coffee  they take a shower they get dressed they drive to work the same way they do the same things they see the same people  that push the same emotional buttons and that becomes the routine and it becomes like a program so now theyve lost their free will to a program and theres no unseen hand doing it to them so when it comes time to change the redundancy of that cycle becomes a subconscious program so now 95 of who we are by the time were 35 years old  is a memorized set of behaviors emotional reactions unconscious habits hardwired  attitudes beliefs and perceptions that function like a computer program the mind  is the matrix in and of itself right now today in this moment i promise you the matrix has you if you guys know david foster wallaces concept of  “this is water”  to a fish water is so ubiquitous it ceases to exist now we all have that same thing  and it’s playing on us and it’s keeping us  from becoming who we want to become  that thing is our mindset  it’s our belief system it is so everpresent  it is so ingrained into the fabric of who you are  and the way that you process data  you don’t even notice it  you don’t even know that it’s real  this is the thing that impacts your life it is your inability to see that your  mindset controls everything  that it is water in and of itself when i heard this from shakespeare i realized  that once you become aware of the water  you can change everything  so then a person can say with their 5 of their conscious mind i want to be healthy i want to be happy i want to be free but the bodys on a whole different program so then how do you begin to make those changes well you have to get beyond  the analytical mind because  what separates the conscious mind  from the subconscious mind  is the analytical mind and thats where meditation comes in because you can teach people through practice how to change their brainwaves slow them down and when they do that properly they do enter the operating system where they can begin to make some really important changes so  most people then wait for crisis or trauma or disease or diagnosis they wait for loss some tragedy to make up their mind to change and my message is why wait and you can learn and change in a state of pain and suffering or you can learn and change in a state of joy and inspiration i think right now the cool thing is that people are waking up
4UXyPKCM7uI,liverpool agree 351m deal to sell sadio mane to bayern munich,Sport,yep uh simon in the past few minutes our colleagues at sky in germany have confirmed that bayern munich have indeed agreed a deal with liverpool to sign their forward sadio mane and the deal is worth 35 million pounds in total and it breaks down to an initial payment of 274 million pounds plus 5 million pounds based on appearances plus a further 26 million pounds based on individual and team achievements now this can be looked at as a really good deal for liverpool because theyre selling sardi omani for a deal worth around 35 million pounds and hes 30 years old eight years after they bought him as a 22 year old from southampton for less than what theyre getting from buying munich because the deal with southampton was worth around 335 million pounds and there was no sellon either so southampton wont be getting any further money from this deal so sky and germany are saying that the deal has been agreed between bayern munich and liverpool its worth around 35 million pounds remember in the past couple of weeks bayern munich went to liverpool with a couple of bids which were like rejected out of hand because some of the uh performancerelated addons simply werent achievable as far as liverpool were concerned but theyve gone back to the um negotiating table and theyve come across a deal that they are happy with which is worth 35 million pounds so the personal terms as well we think have been as good as agreed we think saudi aramania will need to do a medical before this deal is properly rubber stamped but as we were saying uh previously this afternoon it looks like a case of when and not if and it looks like now when saudi armani officially becomes a munich player because the deal between vine munich and liverpool has now been agreed so potentially its looking like a very good bit of business for liverpool and in terms of business theyre getting it done early arent they they seem to be getting all of their business done early that there could be a situation where liverpool come the start of preseason jurgen klopp could be very very happy with the squad that hes got and says this is the squad that were going to move forward with for the rest of the season while a lot of their rivals manchester city perhaps aside um are still trying to do business in this transfer window but if you look at what theyve done fabio cavallo has joined from fulham youve got darwin nunes is a potential club record transfer fee if he fulfills all the performance related addons that could be worth an 85 million pounds worth in transfer fee to benfica and calvin ramsey as well from aberdeen the right back to provide cover for trent alexander arnold that deal looks like its been agreed as well and because theyre well stocked now in that forward department they can afford to allow someone like sadio mane to find a new challenge at bayern munich i mean a couple of seasons ago i think the big question was with liverpool with the likes of sadio manes mohamed salah and roberto firmino all approaching 30 years of age plus i mean salahs just turned 30 years old this month the big question was how are they going to evolve that front three and within the last couple of seasons they brought in a player in his mid20s in diogo jota from wolves theyve brought in louis diaz in his mid20s in january and they brought in darwin nunes for close to 85 million pounds and hes in his early 20s from benfica so it looks like the evolution is complete and they can afford to allow the likes of sadio mane to leave the club but it looks like now it is a case of when and not if saudi armani will become a bayern munich player

it comes with a blue bag with an orange molded scarf pink shoes for tall and curvy barbies a pink camera a mask a neck pillow it has little cat ears on it a lavender visor yellow watch headphones gold colored glasses mine seem to have a little line on them sunblock and a passport these are a lot of items we already have in our collection in different colors the little paper board passport is a fun detail however i would have loved to have had a bag that we could put it in since this set seems to have a travel theme like maybe this type of bag it can easily fit the sunblock and passport this fashion pack was less than five dollars fabric made from recycled plastic excludes trim seriously my velcro is not attached hmm just a second heres the outfit on a classic barbie since this is a one size fits most fashion pack the shorts are a little big we have a red floral print top pink plastic choker and purple boots here it is on a curvy its more fitted to the body however i cant get the shoes to fit i picked up the barbie zoologist for 1499 on amazon i thought the pink shirt might be cute it does have a lot of printed details theres a little globe on her shoulder im not sure why the leaf is there but it velcros in the front she comes with khaki colored shorts tan boots and a brown hat there are also white binoculars a stethoscope little koalas a bottle and i dont think i have one in this color so thats cool and a clipboard we can take a little piece of paper and roll it put it in the bottle to make it look like theres something in it and we can move it to the other end when its upside down thats cool i did have to use tweezers to remove it so youve been warned i feel like i can rock this hat this summer i dont know what do yall think am i guilty of buying dolls just for their clothes yes yes i am but i totally prefer fashion packs ive been looking at this fashion pack for a minute its an oversized pink hoodie with a dinosaur graphic on the front puff sleeves more purple boots a blue hitbag or fanny pack pink bracelet purple plastic scrunchie and a green bag a green necklace and yellow visor here it is on a curvy am i taking the hangers off the fashion packs to use as doll hangers yes yes i am barbie fashionista number 186 i was really excited for this doll we just have a few issues lets see if we can just hide this one music i love the june face sculpt its just you know her face is a little shiny and super pixelated she has burgundy braids gold colored earrings wears a pink yellow and white dress that says love and comes with white shoes this is a curvy barbie if were trying to match her with a madetomove body here is the bmr 1959 curvy and the skin tone is off just a little the fashionista is a little warmer than the bmr doll if you dont mind going to a classic body type then fashionista 166 looks like a good match but i dont think im going to rebody her today maybe face app can clean it up a little lets see hurry up process the photo i mean thats better okay angelina loving your new dress where did these glasses come from oh i think this was from the jurassic world fashion pack speaking of fashion packs i got this on amazon for 999 so what do you think i dont know not sure its quite me but i would love to see it in like a solid color like black it comes with white sneakers a pink bracelet and a second outfit a polka dot top and a gingham print skirt here it is on a curvy i kind of like it paired with the jean shorts this isnt barbie but i bought it for my barbies it is a mini dessert stand i found at target i think it was like three dollars and i thought we could use it as a coffee table look at that i think it could work pretty good with a high couch and they came in different colors i actually bought a pink one as well but i cant find it sorry so unprofessional i found this at the front of the store in that value section i think its called bullseyes playground i could be wrong but it was three dollars and thats a pretty good deal ive bought these before at like craft stores and theyve been way more than three dollars we can use two to make a nice little photo backdrop and i got these palms for three dollars as well i dont have a room for them just yet but i will heres an accessory pack we have a blue gem purse it does open purple heels a belt brush pink lip purse a purple necklace red lipstick a bracelet pink headband silver necklace and a perfume bottle i wish we saw these more often and the belt is kind of cute i would love to see this in more colors like brown and black this fashion pack has a belt and a western kind of theme the bag is cute we have bronzy colored boots a cactus sling bag yellow necklace orange necklace red headband red bracelet green bracelet star glasses and a pink belt i thought this fashion pack looked kind of interesting it has a pink plaid skirt with an orange plaid top and a white hitbag these are two pieces we could easily mix and match with other items like the khaki shorts from the barbie zoologist huh who could that be barbie fashionista number 185 she arrived just in time for the video when i saw this doll online i thought she would make a great alternative for dolores from encanto the hair is already there bam and youre done but i dont know im just not loving the screening i mean is that what its called you know like the face paint its super shiny and pixelated on certain dolls you can totally get away with it like its not as bad on mikasa i mean you know abby but on this fashionista like even her freckles are like shining i think she is really cute i love the hair the head wrap her dress it kind of looks like bleached denim i like the boots overall an adorable doll and we could probably get good photos if we just turned her slightly away from the light this is a fashion pack i was very excited about i bought it on amazon it has a yellow top black sunflower dress yellow flower glasses the dress can be worn without the yellow shirt we can pair it with the included jean shorts and sheer sunflower top and little pink bag i think this is my favorite fashion pack of the day but wait theres more i picked up some clothes for the guys both of the fashion packs were about five dollars each this one is a complete outfit we have a yellow and green shirt faux denim shorts and white shoes its pretty much yellow in the back and i like the length of this shirt so yeah the second fashion pack has a top and shorts the top is orange it says love cali and the shorts have a graffiti print it also comes with a pair of sunglasses i bought several of these because i thought they could be fun new uniforms for the guys on the shelf heres jules donnie august wait a minute they are totally giving boyband vibes okay lets do this maybe we can switch their shorts to denim well you know printed denim and lets add a few more members this is ken from the barbie it takes two series from the camping collection he already has jeans but he needs a made to move body and i know we could just use that one but i like the hair color and paint on the it takes two one better so lets place them in a plastic bag then into hot water until they are soft enough to just be removed that was pretty easy go change into your outfit and welcome the newest member to the band i am also adding rafa from barbie big city big dreams we gave him a made to move body a while back it was the bmr 1959 doll with the green hair i wanted to add jyn from bts but only if he can fit a made to move body hmm its not working for me so here is the lineup lets put the it takes two jeans and put them on jewels with brown shoes for a robert inspired look i did a similar look for ken but his pants are rolled at the bottom and i gave him some different colored shoes for a jessie inspired look i gave doni rolled up ken shorts for a tae taehyung inspired look or we can just go with jyn from bts on his original body for august we gave him overalls brown shoes and a baseball cap from the barbie tiedye fashion pack i have quite a few of those around here for in aaron t inspired look for rafa we gave him jean shorts some brown boots and i used a red hair tie for a sweat band to create an aaron z inspired look completing our boy band inspired by four town from turning red totally not an exact match i took a lot of artistic liberties im not happy about jen not being made to move but those ken sweet orchard farm overalls are perfect and this is a fun addition to our turning red inspired dolls thank you for joining us while we had fun checking out some barbie

outfits we go to the rick owens fashion show at the palais de tokyo in paris to get our mind blown away do we need more action out of this world empresses muses on the roof throwing jasmine leaves a very very rare thing we have access to a fitting with rick owens we get a glimpse into one of the most creative and subversive and wise minds of fashion mr rick owens we talk about his legendary heels boundary breaking sense of style the access is all access this is exceptional this is not a video this is a privilege gothic dark like a lion hello im loic prigent you should definitely subscribe to my channel if you want to see the very best of the fashion scene leave a comment hit the notification bell binge on all my other videos today we have a meeting with the roi de iavantgarde rick owens  loïc  hi hes typing on his computer were back from the covid lockdowns back from the pause outside the paris fashion week is back beating hard the most voracious appetite for clothes im just doing a press release  youre doing it yourself  yes so this is what will be under the youtube video for example i read them religieusement its a fact rick owens uses the youtube medium to its best on his channel under each video of his shows… he writes himself in caps a text of intention a free explanation some patternmaking tricks the philosophical political emotional context of the season “after 4 covidera shows live streamed from my home on venezias lido beach returning bombastically at full blast to the palais de tokyo parvis seemed to ignore the humbling experience we all went through together and are still experiencing” we didnt know what was going to happen with covid i studied architecture i looked at everything art nouveau i got into a heavy art nouveau period we took acid we took mushrooms which i hadnt done for a long time and that was in the garden it was lovely the loveliest experience but it was like now is a good time maybe you need to check the silhouette no im not im just enjoying i dont need to check anything im just enjoying isnt that pretty and yes we get to film a fitting une séance de travail this is tyrone dylan susman model muse and today stylist then maybe we can stitch that  is it organza  no its tulle its a nylon tulle over black chiffon over black double face leather its heavy isnt it this is the day of the rick owens show were in september 2021 this is his first fashion show in paris since the beginning of the covid thing models are excited raya martigny is ready for her close up rick owens inspects his creations on the line up hes calling the models by number number one calling look number one and look number one will be no other than michèle lamy the alltime muse of the house a boom of white smoke on the palais de tokyo fountain ive always tried to do these shows in the palais de tokyo that were big and dramatic but they were elemental and they were not about building sets that would be thrown away michele lamy opens the show magistrale its not a train its like black smoke following her she walks on her radical high heels mysterious volumes forming an abstraction of a skirt unravelling mysterious necklace a brutalist necklace produced by goosens the chanel owned jewellery maker her body is sculpted by sport high priestess who comes in peace the kind of makeup that says i can heal you take mushrooms with me come with me to boxing practice she does a full tour of the fountain alone i enjoyed this walk it felt good to see lots of people again to be with friends and then the models start the spectacular demonstration de mode first silhouette is about sexy but not your sexy cliché reinventing this whole thing showing body wearing the highest cuissarde possible showing maximum skin without showing anything reinventing mystery how do you want them to walk on the runway sedately and not very fast and not ferociously but benevolently i dont want rich bitches i want nuns nuns nice nuns how are you going to walk on the catwalk its more of a confident zened not too powerful not too angry just chill because you usually go like fast angry fierce but today is zen walk like you walk in heaven what do you like about rick owens fashion i love the shoes i love the extraness im an extra girl so this is me and its all black so can never go wrong with that coming to paris i had some trepidation because i knew that everybody was going to “flex” as soon as everybody had the chance they were going to flex and i thought we can be as honourable and as noble as we want were going to look weak unless we flex back we have to flex too how do we do that in a thoughtful nondouchey way and you know im not sure i found the answer of course theres fog machines and we had a test yesterday and the fog is so big that it ends up being a big show like always shoes are high and taking a sharp 90 degrees turn is at your own risk a signature rick owens monster shoulder so big they could be a parody or camp but theyre actually cool by now a zipped bomber for a classic silhouette of the house a reference that is according to rick owens the female equivalent of le corbusiers modular man the human silhouette is supposed to be a standard for modern architecture here is a brisk logic to the pursuit of beauty above all else that has always appealed to me and the endless honing and refining of creative signatures in those that i have always admired a spider web knit with a wellplaced hole arms and hoods are removable depending on the mood and situation so that is matte paillette it has an amazing texture thats almost metallic like foil or something it could be bling bling yeah i dont mind bling we have some bling yeah we do bling sparingly and modestly because i believe in a very sedate aesthetic but there have to be moments of absolute ridiculousness there has to be a sense of humour there has to be flamboyance sometimes i mean we cant be too serious a solemn business suit that means business the lining is outside the complex structure is visible this is rick owens telling us hes a tailleur can we see art nouveau in this dont you think and also those skirts are very of that period theyre kind of these mermaid skirts that flare out and drag and you know i never know if its really all that literal and the idea is that you dont want to take your influences and make them literal you want to blend them in so that they become something else train like dark smoke behind the model muslin creating a fog and the collection is called fogachine the fog machines the body is revealed with almost lingerie effects many fabrics cottons denims are gots certified the highest organic textile standard backstage the creation never stops scissors cutting through a skirt pins added to control what will be revealed above the building of the musée dart moderne temple of modern art muses on the roof are throwing jasmine can you explain what the women on the roof were doing they were throwing leaves these were jasmine leaves from the lido from the lido not really but its almost the same thats the story the jasmine is supposed to come from rick owens own lido terrace near venise as a reference to the four shows he did from the lido through 2020 and 2021 the promesse is mixing glam and thoughtfulness making us look at the paris sky make us think about the wind about hedonism… the coat is sleeveless ripped rough cut but a sophisticated rough cut of course nothing is rough about this cut the armhole is exaggerated the tailoring visible the platform shoes are an event they are thigh high sliced redesigning the leg a mix of sex and sparta youre wearing the same heel actually i always wear these now yeah this has become like my uniform as i get older and especially after covid we need to step it up we need to be a little bit more formal i need to bring a little bit more ceremony to the situations im in elevate them more a little bit thats what im in the mood for formal in my mind means conservative you know conservative isnt the worst thing i mean conservative in its best expressions its about being polite and being respectful of other people but then other times conservatism can be about bigotry definitely but a little bit of formality presenting yourself at your best to other people and being polite im crazy about that thats great thats the kind of formality im talking about she wears her gown as a mask a visual reference may be aubrey beardsley the art nouveau illustrator who drew lots of erotic salomés in great voluminous robes giving sophistication out of this world not touching anything without a ceremony the gloves are high a colour effect that rick owens calls a soft bleeding dégradé the collection goes orange and the last numbers are full orange a crepuscule the main thing is to be as honest and as signature with what i do and to make it the most rick owens things that are not available anywhere else or that nobody else wants to do the models disappear swallowed by the white fog and rick owens taking down the stairs with the same heels as his models taking the same risk but he looks comfortable a smile a wave and he goes back to his world where apparently were all invited voilà this was my report about the rick owens summer collection for 2022 subscribe yes subscribe to my channel if you want to see the fashion the extra the beyondness leave a comment like they spread jasmine leaves on the runway binge on all my other fun videos cheers now you can go train with your super high heels

rid of demons and blood on your walls you know how to call im realizing now i should have read some reviews it started out relaxing then turned into cleaning up satanic rituals and corpses and weird

2IYOLx_yNII,eating pen15 soup in manila exotic china town street food tour,Food,this is soft shell turtle and actually this is not a very common food in the philippines at all i dont know what it is maybe its a hip bone music good morning and welcome to the second channel twice the fun half the effort today we are in the philippines in the city of manila but more important than that we are in chinatown its called pinondo this is the worlds oldest chinatown what i love about chinese folks is almost anywhere you go around the world you can find a china town which is great if youre chinese but honestly its great even if youre not chinese because chinese food is awesome its gonna be a fun day full of interesting foods im not sure what there is in store i want to bring you with me lets go lets do it right now were just walking around getting the lay of the land theres chinese restaurants everywhere theres street food and then i saw this this is the mecca of awful wiring looking at that gives me anxiety i fear that that is what my neurons in my brain look like you have to wonder how many of those are actually active five percent over 30 years this place has been here theyre making something called lumpia now ive had lumpia in the philippines before but i just had the small crispy crunchy fried version but here they have something called fresh lupia music so look at that its just like a giant roll this is an egg and flour wrapper thats on here lets try it out and see whats inside music that is the most interesting unique combination of flavors right away you taste a cabbage you taste the carrots and then youre like is that sugar and peanuts together the sugar is really throwing me off i can feel the grains as im chewing through them so this is like a lumpia sweet sauce you know folks in the philippines love their thick sauces i mean look at that its like a fouryearold just sneezed its like my lumpia has covered sweet syrupy and super thick it certainly has chinese roots and then i believe the recipe is probably altered to soup the palette here in the philippines 95 pesos thats roughly two dollars for a big long breakfast one of my favorite parts about going to any chinatown or even the real china itself is when you go to the market you always find something unexpected something a little unusual theres some tofu i think this is another variation of tofu and then you have this this is a sea cucumber the only type of cucumber im okay with eating it is music very jiggly but then here i was trying to figure out what is this is it shark fin is it jellyfish also its not that it is im told pork nerves do they have just big chunks of nerves music weve come to our second food right here this restaurant is called dont bake dumplings they have a huge assortment of dumplings and it is so busy you can see the people behind me right now about 25 people online you order you actually have to take a number and they tell you to come back down in five minutes in 30 or 45 or an hour these are dumplings this is a type of chinese chive theres also pork inside oh this must have been hanging around a little too long we didnt time it right coming back because theyre all sticking together now theyve kind of steamed together to form one giant masterful dumpling oh man the wrapper is so doughy its salty and then just super strong taste of chives which is so excellent porky juicy and just a wonderful wrapper on the outside maybe even a hint of msg im not sure music right now were in the restaurant known as ki now i was here about six seven years ago my first trip that i did for the main channel i went to the philippines in search of soup number five this is the famed beef penis soup okay lets do this the flavor is actually good the texture i want to see how is the soup number five now have i matured a little bit can i eat a penis without making a penis joke here we can see they have all types of noodle dishes uh pancit lomi miki bihon canton im just reading words i dont know what they mean luckily they have a lot of pictures so im gonna point to what i want i know how to communicate that i want soup number five so were gonna get that and a couple other things and ill meet you guys at the dinner table here it is about lunchtime on a saturday and it is packed people want their penis and other assorted chinese food in the middle we have shumai that is one of the more sad chumais ive ever seen the shumai is not on its a game today it looks like me a little bit hungover but its doing its best and so online my favorite part here is a chili oil it ravages my intestinal tract but i love it anyway fairly meaty little shrimpy flavor chili oil is yummy its tickling the back of my throat it looks like a wreck but inside its a very nice person you dont want to judge the shumai by its cover here we have the black chicken in a dark sultry broth even the meat inside the skin everything is super dark ive eaten black chicken a few different times usually they dont put any flavor to it but i suspect since were in the philippines people like salt they like flavor this is going to have a lot of punch to it lets see i knew it its very savory very delicious lets try it the meat interesting boiling it kind of releases all the fats and dries it out just a little bit and so its soft and tender but certainly not juicy but the broth is juicy this one is just a treasure trove look how big that piece is theyre not going subtle or small with anything in here look at how gelatinous and jiggly it is im gonna build up to that piece in the meantime testicles when i ate this last time in the philippines it was probably my first time wrapping my mouth around any type of testicle itll take some getting used to i didnt know how to take it but now ive had an uncountable amount of balls in my mouth of every animal of every species theres a genuine culinary merit here so i think this should be no big deal for me now kind of a yolky consistency like when you have a hardboiled egg it actually even tastes a little bit eggy itself actually in the philippines theyll even call it eggs like bro you dont have the eggs to mess with me i like it oh heres a piece of beef braised for days soft and tender it is time for this right here the unexciting thing to do would be to take a small bite of this i think i just have to take the whole thing down like a real man and enjoy it ive grown and matured a lot over these last six seven years its time to show it on camera its a big big big bite real big and the flavor is good and you know what it tastes like it just tastes like tenderness its gelatinous is sticky probably i would take smaller bites if i was just me on my own time not recording this video for you guys to see but overall i find it to be quite delicious next time someone tells you to eat dick come here music weve just stumbled into a meat shop here theyre making an interesting combination that i havent seen anywhere in china in the philippines anywhere until right now theyve actually taken the foot theyve taken all the bones out of it theyve processed some meat put the meat inside they sewn it shut and they call it pata ham so hes gonna cut off a piece for me to try thank you so much its like all the ankle skin plus it smells hammy in the middle music its a bit sweet a cross between ham and a sweet chinese sausage oh its really good a thick skin on the outside really chewy skin this is like a scientific breakthrough in ham technology he says the recipe comes from taiwan originally very cool to see here in chinatown even though taiwan says sovereign nation fantastic music this is a street side place where you can pick up food for takeout theyve got some nice fried breads and just a ton of different snack options including the steamed buns behind me and this over here which is what im mainly interested in if you take a look at this this is a lotus leaf wrapped around some rice and then theres different options of meat that could be inside im gonna open it up and see whats inside its like christmas eve morning christmas eve you get to open one gift in my household today im going with this some have a red string some have a green string and that indicates what is inside this one is packed with the most stuff thats why i got it registering means theres chicken pork and theres mushrooms too oh its looking messy on the inside wow so the rice is brown i thought it might be white and it is sticky this looks wild i mean would you take a look at that this is a huge energy packed meal you got in a fight with your wife and she didnt pack you lunch last night no worries just pick this up on the way to work for a little bit over two dollars oh it even has bones inside who would make such a creation with bones oh the flavor is so good a little bit of mushroom and then a big glob of that rice the rice has been soaked in some kind of a soy sauce base so every bite has a ton of flavor lets try out this mushroom super salty sticky and satisfying i like that you kind of have to feel around figure out what it is this is i think some pork oh thats good i like that a lot the flavors are good plus some little surprises mixed in you dont know if youre gonna get chicken or pork or mushroom or a collectible beanie baby anything anything could be inside weve come down the sidewalk i noticed this restaurant right here no place is good if you see a lot of people eating there ive heard theres turtle i heard theres a sea cucumber and a few other surprises were gonna go inside right now and check it out here we have the chinese turotoro which means point point you can point and then kind of just choose what you want on the spot they have a lot of unique menu items here it has a pork tongue here it is an orangey liquid can i have the tongue music and can i have the turtle yes wow i just get the whole plate look at all this stuff and then one more thing sir could i have some sea cucumber please these are some unique dishes i did not expect to see here today lets just go from this side to this side because i think it just keeps getting more interesting as we go along this way ending with the turtle here this is a full tongue of a pig music you know they offered to slice this up about 30 times so i just kept saying no because i wanted to do this music i was just thinking about what it would be like if a pig was alive and i put a song on my mouth but its not alive it cant hurt me its not here if you dont have a warped and twisted mind like me the tongue is actually very enjoyable it is super salty savory soft it is a completely different texture than any other part of meat thats why i would even have a pork tongue over a pork chop to be honest but you do have to control your thoughts while you eat it next we are moving on to the sea cucumber now i feel like it was destiny earlier in one of the alleyways we saw a big tub of sea cucumbers and then here they have the cooked version she was telling me about the process of making these it is so intense it is about boiling and boiling and soaking when i had it in korea it is so hard to chew through it is like cartilage its like impossible to chew through oh i did it not a ton of flavor its just briny like the ocean im gonna see if this is different lets try it out wow it makes me feel uncomfortable a little bit like when someone ends a sentence with an upward intonation when someones like i went to the mall music and youre like end and then they never finish you cant chew through it it doesnt chew apart it just splits apart it reminds me of eating jellyfish is that a helpful example is that relatable no see like theres nothing to compare it to the sauce on there is delicious just like a savory gravy the more i eat it the more i like it this is probably my favorite version of sea cucumber ever and i think its because of all the time and care that they put into it right here our third and final food this is soft shell turtle and actually this is not a very common food in the philippines at all what makes it kind of special or unique is that its cooked adobo style with the addition of some chinese spices so that is a really famous filipino way of cooking where youre grazing meat in vinegar and soy sauce for a long time until it kind of falls apart and becomes soft and tender oh its an edge piece of shell the edges where its soft becomes like a skin and then this is still like a bone otherwise these big pieces it could be joints shoulders elbows knees toes turtle adobo lets go for it music very jelly like fatty gelatinous spices are interesting it tastes like adobo but with a chinese five spices its very aromatic all right lets try this i dont know what it is maybe its a hip bone music really soft wow incredibly tender im conflicted im distraught im very clamped does that mean something i didnt graduate college any of the three times i i tried then its so soft and tender its been braised so much that the meat is falling apart its savory and you just taste the cinnamon and they start anise and the different chinese spices that they put inside to mask any of the turtley gaminess is pretty dang good thats what im trying to tell you it kind of is blowing my mind i cant believe it im not a huge fan of turtle overall but if i had to root for one turtle it would be the one on this plate way to go buddy oh that is the end of the video i hope that you enjoyed a little flavor of chinatown here in manila it is a completely different place from any other chinatown ive been to especially i love the fact that theres a fusion between chinese roots and filipino ingredients and methods of cooking we just showed you just a tiny tiny fraction of what is available but we did try to find some of the most unique dishes and i believe today we have succeeded in doing that guys that is it for this video thank you so much for watching i will see you next

ten here so you guys are gonna be the first team eliminated i am sorry already one team is down congratulations everybody else on making it to round two in level two things get a little harder each team will be provided with a plot in 30 minutes to create a mini performance and whoever has the worst performance is a limiting there are three doors i need everybody to choose one now oh cars cars lets go we got cars lets go thats like my favorite movie you guys have 30 minutes go oh we gotta go we gotta go oh my god all right guys we have 30 minutes to basically build whatever we want and since we chose cars we gotta have good skins and we gotta actually use cars for our performance all right so right now were pretty much halfway done with our build were actually making really good progress i think theres 19 minutes left i think we got this in the back all right so our first performance here is toy story show me what you guys got all right so this looks like in the movie when the toys were hiding in the cone which is pretty creative i do like that so they got to go across the road for sure yeah looks like theyre just trying to make it past these cars that are getting launched that is really creative really interesting oh and it looks like theyre going to big als toy barn i remember him from the movie all right so theyre up to the toy barn whats gonna happen here we definitely have buzz and woody hey that is so sick and i think this is jesse so this is definitely toy story too that was executed pretty well i love the creativity the scenery is awesome good execution i do like buzz i like woody i like jesse the skins are really clean i think im gonna give you guys a solid seven out of ten all right so we have the cars team here this is pretty sick looking already we got lightning mcqueen chick hicks and the dynaco guy all right its now our turn we have to make this perfect or were gonna lose go come on come on come on so it looks like this is

really sick and it looks like lightning mcqueens out in front so these guys are oh oh i know whats gonna happen dude so the dyna guy guy hes out in the water lightning mcqueen stopped at the finish line the chick hicks wins of course hes probably celebrating over there hes excited but lightning mcqueen the nice guy that he is hes going to be pushing the dinoco guy all the way to the finish line this is probably the best part of the movie so this is pretty freaking cool were doing the infamous scene where lightning mcqueen pushes the blue car in wow we gotta keep going i think we executed it pretty well i hope he caught the idea of the blue car flying in the air and crashing i think we got this i dont know and hes got the lightning on his backlink too that is so sick i like this one a little bit better than the other yeah i think im gonna give this one an eight out of ten this one was really good guys i really did like and last we have finding nemo lets see how this goes follow this fish stick here hey dory lets go to that submarine okay so nemo and dory going to the submarine these look dangerous so were in the minefield right now i do remember this part of the movie thats

meeting the shark oh theyre meeting bruce thats a good part of the movie too for sure so these guys are gonna keep going through the minefield now play hide and seek this is a good scene from the movie its a pretty creative one you guys have built a pretty darn good scene bruce is looking for the fish he smells blood oh i remember this part yeah so now hes gonna try and kill the fish no but theyre friends not food buddy what are you doing so he makes it to this cage here hes just running around and dorys coming in dory what are you doing he trapped him perfect takes the l on him okay

wBEAjjioZFI,game theory fnaf the clue that almost solves everything fnaf security breach,Game,today we end the horror today we solve fnaf wait didnt we say this exact same thing seven years ago music applause music hello internet welcome to game theory the show that reminds me that if you click the like button hard enough itll summon dj music man to your neighborhood for a block party go ahead try it hit that like button didnt work have you have you tried clicking subscribe i hear that sometimes works too i guess you must not be clicking hard enough i dont know what to tell you speaking of not working hard enough arent you tired of just plain boring merch the kind that you buy and sure it looks cool but it just sits there on your body not doing anything interesting well what if your merch was actually a puzzle introducing the worlds first quest jacket i know what youre thinking a denim jacket isnt anything revolutionary and youd largely be right except youd also be missing one of the most crucial details those patches theyre not just any old dnd style patches theyre clues to help you solve a much bigger puzzle that exists inside of this thing its not just a jacket its the worlds first arg jacket you heard that right a world first its not every day that you create like the first of something but to all my research i dont think a product like this has ever existed weve actually been working for the past two years to make something like this happen working with garment manufacturers to sew secrets into places that theyve never even thought about before obviously i dont want to give too much away because part of the fun is letting you guys solve this for yourself but we pulled out all the stops to give you a piece of clothing that you can actually experience this thing is premium to the max and if you manage to solve it you get a special final patch to show that you are truly the puzzle master so go ahead head on down to the description and be a part of history grab yourself the first ever piece of airg clothing and what will be the first in our series of quest jackets roll an investigation check to see if youve got what it takes today we finish milking i mean covering the major mysteries of security breach and you know what i think i solved it or at least i think ive solved most of it seven years ago i made this video the clue that solves five nights at freddys where we put together all the pieces to support dream theory the concept that the first four games of the series were all a collection of nightmares happening inside the mind of a child in that episode there were lots of points of evidence but ultimately the conclusion hinged on one key design detail the alarm that brought each night to a close at six oclock am a grandfather clock for three games and a digital clock for number four three games in the crying childs house where we see a grandfather clock the fourth in a hospital right before he dies which ironically enough is the one whose gameplay is happening in a recreation of the house oh theres a reason this series is so difficult to talk about anyway the reason i bring that video up is because todays theory works largely in the same way over the past few half episodes ive been trying to make heads or tales of security breach pulling at what to me felt like the strongest thread gregory as the crying child reborn in a robot body him reuniting with his brother michael in the form of glam rock freddy and his sister elizabeth in the form of vanessa and weve covered a lot of evidence trying to support that claim the characters design colors the ice cream the voice lines robotic eyes the satisfying narrative arc that it provides the games threestar ending i mean its a lot there are two episodes that are jampacked full of discussion around exactly this but today i finally have my smoking gun the clue that takes it from just a controversial theory to at least in my mind largely proven fact just like with the clocks and the dream theory its the one clue that is so specific so intentional that it confirms that this was the main intent of the game until of course they decided to retcon it all due to bad audience feedback to keep the franchise going for another seven years sorry guys i hate to say it but i think im unfortunately right this time gregory is a robot and hes the crying child reborn and by the end of today i think youre gonna be convinced and then from there were gonna talk about how all of that factors into the games narrative and its final mystery patient 46 it all begins here the postit room this is unexpected after exploring the sewers to decommission chica gregory winds up here a room full of glowing staff bot heads and lots of postit reminders on literally every surface i mean this thing is a flashing neon sign that says important lore here and yet in online discussions its been largely overlooked because its kind of sandwiched in the middle of the game overshadowed by the animatronic spaghetti monster ending and even though i knew that something had to be hidden in here trying to figure it out was like finding a needle in a haystack so what is this what are we looking at here i think its pretty obvious yeah is it obvious matt what what is it you get to a certain age uhhuh and you just you got to start taking notes postit notes yeah you just leave them around okay but also theres um robot heads so with that incredible insight i spent literal hours off camera trying to look at every single postit note to make sure that i had the full picture and the answer i got was dont do not do that learn from my mistakes it took me so long so long only to discover that the game files had been dug up and the postit textures were just there in three simple images thanks to just x fought for uploading these to github flush those hours of my life down the toilet when you study these posted textures you actually realize that there are three phases to the postit notes one thats barely legible another where the spelling and drawing improve slightly and the final where they become nearly perfect it looks like someone is trying to learn how to write and draw slowly getting better over time and it all begins here with a note written in binary when you first enter the room theres a cardboard box in the middle which if i were to guess is steel wool trying to draw our attention to the most important postit clues in what otherwise is a very crowded and busy looking room on it we get this binary string which translates to why is i thats it the grammar i think is intentionally bad because this is a computer coming into consciousness asking the question why am i alive and doing it written in binary the language of machines computers robots elsewhere in the room is more binary that translates to hide whatever this thing is its scared and its confused it hides until it can better understand what or who its meant to be the other illegible phase 1 notes here are random flashing thoughts the sky kids love random glimpses of memories coming into focus the phrase i can feel it is this creature coming into consciousness and this right here you are something family which looks like afton family but its pretty unclear in short it appears to be a machine that started speaking in binary but as more and more memories start to take hold it begins to write in normal alphabetic characters when you dive into the notes from phases 2 and 3 though things start to get much clearer its mainly images and text revolving around birthday parties happy place birthday time family a pile of presents some cake lets get snack fun fun fun friends forever pizza time nothing particularly earth shattering for a series about pizza restaurants but then theres one posted in the phase three notes that really stands out the one clue that truly brings together the last two months of research this thing is the linchpin its our smoking gun my friends and it all boils down to a present alongside three simple words all for me the party was all for me does that mean anything to you because it certainly does for me you see in the fnaf survival logbook a seemingly innocuous workbook full of pizzeriathemed activities you have three voices speaking through the pages michael afton writing his answers in red pen the vengeful spirit cassidy using lightly faded text and the crying child altering the physical text of the book one conversation that happens between cassidy and the crying child plays out like this cassidy says the party was for you and the crying child responds it was for me all for me suddenly all the party imagery makes sense the balloons the cake the kids this is the bite victim the crying child coming into consciousness and remembering the birthday party that took his life and using this context suddenly everything in these notes takes on a whole new meaning in the first phase of notes we see a crudely drawn house with a set of arrows pointing towards what looks to be a strange set of doors maybe another building which admittedly doesnt make much sense unless this is the crying child who in fnf4 would walk down and to the right and then back up to go to freddys with his brother every single day in the phase three notes we see this closeup of a bear which would have been the last thing that the crying child saw before his head got chomped blue yellow green and red those are the flashing lights above the fredbear stage as he gets bit or you know maybe its the balloons on the nearby table for someone who cant tell the difference between blue and purple even things like hide and know hide relate to the crying childs behavior throughout fnaf 4 he hides under tables and he is constantly made fun of for it throughout the game we also see a lot of dialogue about running away just like on the postits digging deeper we also start to see other patterns emerging the number 7 shows up repeatedly as both a set of tally marks as well as a set of six faces with a smaller seventh one off to the side this ties us directly back to fnaf vr where we had a glitching purple gravestone for afton in the middle of seven normal gravestones five missing children charlie the puppet and the smaller face watching on the crying child as he says in other notes all my friends theres also repeated use of the number three three faces three kids words repeated three times like home home home and fun fun fun three slices of pizza three presents even just counting to the number three so what would that mean well think about it weve seen a lot of references to a house and family throughout these postits seems to me like its a reference to the three afton kids michael elizabeth and the crying child himself and the thing that brings all of it together isnt a postit note but instead the table higher up in the room where we see the staff bots arranged like a family at dinner a mother and a father alongside their three kids one redheaded pigtail girl one boy and a kid with his head bit off and just to hammer it all home in the middle of the table the collectible is a poster for fredbears family diner the place of the bite the place where all of this began it looks like the robot finally figured out who he was and he started to recreate his family the robot is the crying child which by proxy then has to be gregory and if you need further proof of humanoid robots in the game ili becky and reddit caught this detail from sister location humanoid heads ones that look very similar to gregorys face oh and a last thing much to everyones excitement theres actually a new book series coming out later this year a new season of fazbear frights called tales from the pizzaplex obviously referencing the location and security breach the cover of the first book in the new series robot kid there it is which leads us then to the last puzzle of security breach the retro cds for those of you dont know there are 16 cds around the map that you can only find once youve upgraded freddies eyes from there you take the cds to a hidden room designed to look exactly like mikes room from sister location these cds seem to be recordings of the therapy sessions for two patients patient 71 who we mentioned last time is clearly vanessa and patient 46 who we never get to hear speak and over the course of the various sessions 46 and 71 are set up to be direct opposites of each other vanessa likes flowers patient 46 does not oh you like those the janitor on this floor has a garden and has been putting bouquets in the offices here for years whats the problem oh the flowers ill move them vanessa likes blue skies and doesnt like dark basements 46 prefers it dark i like the blue sky i dont like dark basements oh right too bright when the shades pulled it feels like were in a cubby hole or a cave yeah vanessa doesnt like candy 46 does would you like a candy no thank you those have 35 calories a piece sure you can have a candy clearly were meant to see these characters as opposites which is why so many people online consider that patient 46 might actually be vani vanessas alter ego possessed by glitch trap or even more extreme vanessas evil twin sister considering the fire ending shows us a dead vani on the ground and vanessa looking down from the burning buildings roof but lets quickly talk about those two interpretations first of all vanessa and vani are the same person they have to be all the evidence leading up to this game in places like fnaf special delivery have pointed to a woman named vanessa a getting mind hacked by afton and reluctantly following his orders and in this game we still have pieces of evidence for instance in the cds we learned that vanessa is buying fake fur to make the vanity costume on your brakes it looks like you were shopping for a costume you purchased some fake fur material what are you gonna make if shes not the one wearing it why would she be making it to me the fire ending here is meant to be symbolic we havent beaten princess quest yet so vanessas spirit is still trapped inside that burning building but her body has died she is one person but could the persona of vani actually be patient 46 again the evidence just doesnt seem to add up to that throughout their sessions we get multiple indications that the therapist is speaking to a child the way they speak to patient 46 here you dont want me to get in trouble do you i could be put in the corner for a time out yeah you think thats funny huh and again here tragedy always leads to a feeling of loss its a hole that feels funny right the way they explain simple words and im surprised by your knowledge of computers youre something of a phenom do you know what that word means it means you have unusual skill like haka the way they point out that 46 doesnt fit into the chair that chair doesnt really fit you does it they even mention the fact that they specifically work with children you know i work with people of all ages from little kids to the very elderly i understand that therapists would want to treat alters as they see themselves but this just doesnt seem to fit at no point do we get an indication that vani sees herself as a child but now lets go back to what we assume we know about 46 theyre a kid they like the dark they like candy theyre really good with computers in fact theyre a bit robotic themselves answering questions in cold detached ways when i read your account of what happened it came across as well more of an objective rather than a subjective narrative oh sorry you dont know what that means do you here again we get another example of the therapist having to explain a relatively simple word now look at our postit room its a dark cave underground outright labeled as this is my home on the central cardboard box is a drawing of candy and a robot would be emotionally detached and would also be great at hacking heck the therapist does tell patient 46 to write down their feelings i suggested you write down exactly what made you so sad and scared and if this room isnt an example of that i dont know what is taking it one step further if im right in saying that gregory is indeed the robot that came into consciousness here thats why he doesnt fit into the chair hes a kid thats also the reason steel wool couldnt let us hear 46s voice throughout these therapists tapes it would give away the game it would immediately take away the mystery of who 46 is since we hear gregory talk so much but why would gregory a robot kid hiding out in the pizzaplex actively be seeking out therapy hes not in a school of any kind and hes not employed so it wouldnt be mandated what is going on here well over the course of the 16 cds we listen as both patient 46 and vanessa visit a total of five therapists all of whom are implied to have been mangled to death by machinery but the deaths here arent arbitrary if you track the tapes each therapist ends up getting killed off immediately after they start asking vanessa about encrypted messages that shes been receiving from a mysterious figure your performance reviews are good but a routine check of your online history has revealed that you spent quite a bit of time with someone in an encrypted conversation we have transcripts and ive read them dead the next session the messages youre getting seem very manipulative in nature you know who im talking about why wont you open up about it these files are full of details about your life again dead the next session when the encrypted messages get brought up to 46 same thing when i saw some of your recent encrypted conversation logs at first i thought i was looking at more examples of you just talking with yourself then i realized it was different when i study this it sounds like there is someone else responding to you a third therapist bites the dust the therapists cover all sorts of topics bad childhoods work history one therapist even confronts patient 46 with all the other dead therapists nothing no response its only once the encrypted messages come up that theyre suddenly marked for death we also know that its 46 doing the killing here the dead therapists are a complete surprise to vanessa hi go ahead sit down i dont know you what happened to oh well get to know each other in no time but to 46 just business as usual why did you lie why dont we come back to this another day youre shaking your head as though thats not going to happen hes shaking his head because he knows that now she is also marked for death to me all of this screams of 46 keeping tabs on vanessa hes going to therapy not for himself but rather to follow her actions making sure that shes not saying anything that she shouldnt about these encrypted messages and when the therapists do get too close to the truth theyre bumped off we learn in one of the last cds that patient 46 isnt being manipulated but is instead the one doing the manipulation i dont think youre being manipulated here i think youre the one doing the manipulating no comment huh putting two and two together would tell us that patient 46 is the one communicating with vanessa hes controlling her life for some reason in fact 46 appears to be the reason vanessa is working at the pizzaplex in the first place one odd detail of the ingame messages is that vanessa was not supposed to get the security job in the message marked for deletion we see that vanessas lack of security experience gets the interviewer to not recommend her for the job and yet shes hired anyway despite as it says in another message no prior qualifications in both messages were told that its an internal reference coming from the top that got her the job someone has brought vanessa here for a specific purpose and who better than a hacker thats clearly established to be in the pizzaplexs emails patient 46 gregory in short it looks like gregory is manipulating the situation determined to get vanessa to work at the pizzaplex following her to all her mandated therapy sessions and ultimately killing off anyone that gets too close to the truth i mean after all gregory is not opposed to using a bit of violence to get what he wants we have to get these we can upgrade you hes also not opposed to lying about it this upgrade it was chicas please be honest how did you get it when i was in the kitchen earlier she fell into some sort of garbage smasher is she okay well shes still functional but why why is he going to all of this effort well combine it with what we saw in the postit room theres a family reunion scene multiple postits referring to family the three siblings their house remember what i said earlier a robot has come into consciousness and is trying to reclaim what he lost his family he wants the family back together and so hes doing everything in his power to make that happen using his hacking skills hes managed to break into staff files so he knows that theres something off about vanessa maybe he even knows that his dads consciousness is inside of her hes also got his brother and freddie and his dad in the basement the family in this game is truly coming together again reclaiming what crying child once lost and thats it thats the whole theory done there are definitely no holes or flaws to anything i just said dont look any deeper than everything i just told you all right fine there might be a few ittybitty holes to all of this explanation namely some of the info that we get from the last two cds if patient 46 is gregory then why is he glitching the system to make all the animatronics scarier if he lured vanessa to the pizzaplex then why would he then be avoiding her throughout the game why would he be surprised to see afton in the basement if hes trying to bring the family all together theres also the mystery of the whole parent story 46 is said to have good parents none of what you said in your file about your parents was true the truth is you had great parents a great childhood why did you lie but how would records of good parenting exist for a robot who presumably had no parents or the crying child whose records presumably would say that he was dead or even if you dont believe those theories if 46 is gregory and gregorys just a homeless kid that doesnt sound like he would have had a great childhood or any sort of home life but the kicker the one to me that makes this really difficult to explain is this email that i had long forgotten about from fnaf ar strap in for this one friends hey ness i hope things are good i saw you ordered three lifelike human male rubber masks and i was dying to ask what theyre for sounds to me like a robot kid is confirmed but it also sounds to me like vanessa built it or gave rise to this robot kid if so then i ask again why would gregory be avoiding her throughout the game i mean the best i could come up with is that somehow gregory escaped and is now convinced that vanessa is trying to shut him down because of his rogue programming i mean its not a bad idea but then why would he be luring her to the pizza plex its like one half of each explanation works but then when you try to connect it back with like the other half of the theory they end up contradicting each other which is really frustrating there are two other options first the robot kit from the postit room is entirely brand new or the second option is its someone that we never see in the game baby now the first option of a brand new character yeah its cool i guess i cant really speculate about that it could literally go anywhere and solve everything as for option two baby just like with gregory there are certain things that fit and other things that just dont baby like gregory could want to put the family back together baby has always wanted to make daddy proud so shed be quite happy to kill off therapists that got too close to the truth just like we see with 46 and she would willingly spread the afton virus to make the animatronics scary in order to bring daddy back if shes using illusion discs or if she acts like she does in the books then its possible that shed be able to take the form of a child and make up a backstory shes also a character that canonically loves disguises just like patient 46 it reminds you of a mask like a disguise yeah i can see that you like the idea of being disguised disguises let you be sort of invisible dont they theres also a line about the therapist being able to see patient 46s eyes thats better on this side of the desk i can see your eyes and we know that babys eye color has always been an important detail in the past but as with gregory there are still a number of holes with this line of thinking baby slash elizabeth likes flowers patient 46 doesnt we also know baby hates being in the basement of sister location so then why as patient 46 would she prefer to live in a cave rather than blue sky in short as i wrap up my overall coverage of security breach i guess i gotta summarize it like this this game is frustrating from a lore standpoint smaller questions like glam rock bonnie and golden freddy yeah those are pretty easy to answer but when it comes to what this game was actually about no one theory actually solves it all in a clean way there are references to every corner of the fnaf universe in here but as a result nothing fits cleanly together to solve everything there are pieces that always dangle or always contradict something else do i think the crying child is here based on the postit room yes absolutely is he gregory i mean right now i think that hes our best option is he also patient 46 seems like hes trying to be but there are just a lot of holes there and there are holes in the baby theory too and that honestly just leaves the option of a mysterious third party pulling the strings behind the scenes which on one hand would be welcome id love to see a new character inserted into this lore but on the other hand it also feels unsatisfying because its like well that came out of nowhere this franchise has never operated like that so it feels weird for it to start acting that way now individually small pieces of the mystery make sense but when you take a step back and look at the wider lore of the series how it connects to other games how it connects to the wider story arc thats been created thats when things start to fall apart and i think that is what is so frustrating with this title so thats what im left with let me know what your thoughts are are you seeing things that im not hopefully at least sparked some ideas in your head and hey if it did you can let me know live right now i am officially live with other members of team theorists other fnaf tubers all of us covering things about this game my hot takes on the security breach lore other theories that we havent covered yet and of course just generally chatting about what we thought of the game where we think the franchise is going and what we predict will be the upcoming dlc nothing is off the table friends so if you have fnaf theories yourself throw them out there and we can discuss them live link is down in

united or brentford thats right a significant 24 hours in the future of christian ericsson good morning hayley great to see you this is a really fascinating story at the moment because christian eriksen is quite simply deciding on two options one is manchester united the second is brentford quite amazing to think that ten years ago manchester united were challenging for premier league titles ten years ago brentford were in league one preparing for their first game of the season which was against berry theyre now competing in the same market to sign the same player and i for one am really intrigued as to how this one plays out so both offers are fair respectful and decent christian eriksen is very aware that manchester united are a huge club and have offered him a really good strong deal the same with brentford and it really is a head and a heart situation you can almost weigh up the pros and cons for him deciding to go to either manchester united or brentford of course he worked with thomas frank as a youngster he just had a hugely successful spell there keeping the side in the premier league he was the heartbeat of that brentford midfield from january right through to the end of the season i think if you speak to most brentford fans they would say without christian eriksen we possibly could have gone down thats how influential and important he was for us at the back end of last season it was thomas frank and brentford that gave him the opportunity off the back of everything that had happened with him so therefore theres a loyalty there to the football club but then you call of course youve got manchester united one of the biggest clubs in world football revitalizing that squad that midfield and youve got eric tenharg who was someone that allowed him to train with iax off the back of what happened in the euros so theres a really nice connection there as well youve got christian eriksens family who was settled in london doesnt necessarily want to move anywhere outside of of london so thats important for him money is no motivating factor in this deal so its purely for football reasons and hes got these two huge opportunities um so its going to be fascinating as to how this one plays out theres no rush or time scale on the decision christian erickson is very relaxed at this moment in time he knows hes got options on the table and playing football and being in the right place is key now something you mentioned to me earlier on actually was was gary neville now gary neville has actually been tweeting as well take a look at this because i think this is this is really interesting now ive got my glasses on hayley so youre going to have to read that for me okay with it with a squint and a look yeah he said thats why dividends have to stop for a period every penny has to go back into the club until it becomes attractive again this cup has become a graveyard for players culturally for owners to take money out of poorly performing business is a demoralizing and this is of course um an article that sky sports have posted on their website about the fact that these dividends are going to be taken out of the club theyre looking at the finances of things and using christian ericsson as an example of the type of player that that theyre going for and gary neville just really unhappy with the whole situation with regards to i guess everything in the way that the club is being run yeah so allegedly um there are dividends being taken out of the football club going to board members today which is something that happens at football clubs but what gary neville is referencing there is that why should money be going out of manchester united when were trying to rebuild this site regenerate old trafford and invest in the academy the infrastructure and rebuild this fantastic club into the great club that it once was and how are manchester united competing with brentford and thats no disrespect to brentford um but for for a player that of course has a lot of quality but but should that be the situation and should money be going at the club in that way so really really interesting we know that gary neville was hugely passionate about manchester united and is always honest about manchester united as well so yeah well keep our our eyes and ears to the ground on this one christian erickson with a straight shootout decision between united and brentford things would be a bit easier if they got the big bucks for paul pogba but gone on a free they get absolutely nothing for this possibly the worst bit of business ever done of course twice for paul pogba going to juventus whens this deal going to be completed well were expecting some movement on this deal in the next 24 hours today could be a really significant day for the future of the 29 year old midfielder what do we know we know that theres an agreement in place between juventus and paul pogba sky in italy are reporting its a three plus one year deal or four year deal on the table for him and this contract is due to start at the beginning of july and like you say after six years at manchester united he is a free agent to decide his future and i was looking at paul pogbas success at juventus when he was there before as a youngster hugely successful um won a whole host of of silverware including four syria titles at manchester united in six years just two trophies the europa league and the efl cup um arguably paul pogbas biggest success at manchester united wasnt actually for manchester united it was winning the world cup in 2018 with france so i think this this whole scenario is coming to an end and ive been talking about paul pogba during transfer windows for about six years it almost feels like immediately after we joined manchester united theres speculation about him leaving and every single window theres been onoff talks about any potential departure but i get the feeling that genuinely and wholeheartedly this might be the last day we talk about paul pogba making a move in a transfer window so were expecting some movement today but all eyes pointing towards juventus music

that same combo the pink is a little iffy but i gotta respect that back bling matching with the whole skin so beautiful ah that does not match it could be better what do you think about that yes or no

backplane hes going skiing thats from like the mogul masters if im not mistaken yep no green passes cypher rocking the candy cane and the candy cane pickaxes so thats a similar combo i think that goes with that actual skin it does so it doesnt oh okay and then hes got a nice back bling no green at all very actually you know what thats a really good matching combo the red of the the backlink matches with the candy cane the white matches and then overall the black in the red with the pickaxe to the skin looks really good thank you its all different sets too good youre good good thats a christmasy

take it harley quinn fighting potato man i have no idea what this is maybe i just gotta watch harley quinn is there something im missing there were gonna come back to you devito pc dub so thor using

was messing up oh god im ready yeah okay so hes throwing the bottle he didnt land it though so hes upset and he turns into the hulk the gauntlet on the back is pretty good it matches the whole theme i like that its pretty different too because i think most people went with the iron man thor that kind of thing but this is a different approach with marvel so i respect that and a little different too it doesnt even tell a story of something that happened but just hulks getting upset she never used the gauntlet though she tried to take it from thanos but she ended up failing just like you did sir im sorry batman hes crying because thats his mom thats his dad and you got the roses on the back thats pretty dang creative okay good job guys we got what two people eliminated that round so you guys came up with some pretty good stories and the next theme is going to be the best looking meal so a food theme something super super simple should be fairly quick best looking meal chun li hey no no no no no no no no okay something to know about this first thing lets see who comes out i think second and third whoever comes out second and third are gonna have like some kind of bonus points in a way what would you do for the pickaxe chun li with the cake backlink listen i dont want to get eliminated here if it goes over nicks head you know bt dizzy came out second so we still have a third slot whoever won okay dad came out oh hes dead in cypher i think oh thats a tough one its between dead and cipher lets go here we go see this is not hes not going to win first thing we have dead hes got man cake right hes got the backlink that matches though yeah its all one combo so thats gonna be judged pretty harshly we got dizzy gingerbread i dont know how the gingerbread matches with the cake though thats i guess youre you could put gingerbread on cakes i guess we got pc dub gingerbread as well with chicken and a smoothie cipher pk honestly out of everyone so far so while it doesnt really like match color wise its really good with a meal so you got the the hamburger up front you got the fries on the side and then chicken thats like a good meal i feel like everybody will eat that everyone else so far kind of has you know nothing too too crazy when it comes to variety so lets see what else we got moon it so hes a hamburger hot dog youre having a bbq with a shake thats actually really good too cant go wrong with that on the grill tomato man summoning a tomato thats thats all you got it youre having cereal with tomatoes thats disgusting bread kill him okay original step forward towards the center right here and dead step forward towards the center right here chad were going to vote who gets eliminated right now they both need to get eliminated with you dad okay everybodys saying dad dad im sorry any final words this facial expression has changed gg fair enough man of respect all right erin jim you made it this round youre lucky tomato cereal were going to be asking the most expensive skin combo you have the thing is im not going to be judging it based on i had to buy a whole xbox one bonus points and this is gonna be no exceptions ill give you guys a heads up at 30 seconds oh the balenciaga one is definitely like its expensive theoretically you know 17 this is it so were gonna go through them all ill tell you guys what i know this is um i feel like a nintendo switch skin if im not mistaken its got those nintendo switch colors too this is a ps4 uh skin back in the day it might be even ps5 as well this is the halo when halo the master chief skin came out if you went on xbox you could easily unlock that thats balenciaga and then the red knight is a battle pass skin as well i feel like thats just a skin oh okay thats just a skin from the store if im not mistaken right so i think you have to pay 600 500 or something im gonna go through them again guys if you see anything can we get a price so nintendo switch its probably just one of those actual physical copies of fortnite you buy which is what like 40 bucks 30 bucks same thing with this ps3 one or ps4 its the exact same price master chief xbox one x you have to have the xbox one x oh so you had to buy an xbox okay so thats another 10 like 530 lets just go away i mean i think moon it i think you lost bro out of everyone this is really expensive its a samsung phone i think theres actually two separate phones here that he had to buy am i right about that not not yeah yeah yeah its either between moon it pc dub or dizzy were gonna be dying guys if you could step forward moon it dub and dizzy i think dizzy and dub are the same price so we might eliminate two people here all right munito what do we think about dobb and dizzy fake i think they can make it to the next round i think they make it to the next round okay were getting into the top four guys this is gonna be super super intense now we are gonna try to go with cipher pk locker bundle youre standing next to cyber pk so if you dont have his bundle thats disrespect so you gotta get eliminated im sorry theres an oni mask backlink all right guys you guys should be big fans of cypress you should have the locker already set up saved in that bundle and therefore were going to put 30 seconds on the clock i think everyones actually oh no dub is still in there okay 25 seconds uh so unfortunately dizzy does not have the manic skates he picked the season three skin sorry dizzy oh no way dub you dont have it either its gonna be a 1v1 after this weve got cypher oh wait oh yeah that is that is actually a different variant i havent seen that in a good minute i think that was one they recently added to very cool hes got the nice backbling as well everything matches even the pickaxe and oh thats a different theme too we also got a reindeer nothing too too crazy but i actually like that red knight backlink so we are in the final 1v1 it is cypherpk and orindium its gonna be the first of three so whoever gets three points first is gonna be the winner i want you guys to start it off with something lighthearted the ugliest skin you have and the stipulation with these ones our chat is going to vote so theres no bias no nothing im not going to be the one to vote im going to go off based uh a poll in the chat mincemeat whats a pickaxe thats ugly chat gotta be something thats like really bad i dont know i thought i had it with the backlink but its not oh dude i mean thats thats almost matching though thats ugly like that is just straight up ugly the pickaxe whats an emo thats annoying lets see what we got ugliest looking skin oh you know what when i thought of ugly i was thinking almost of like the thickest skin the biggest skin big chug its that monster even thats a pretty hideous looking skin its got flies even around it backling hes got a dead head with the flies kind of going above him kind of matches that theme of it being old the pickaxes yeah theyre definitely pretty hideous also not even matching left to right over here with orindium weve got chicken and the polar peak monster with the back bling being i dont know what skull this is from but its not up to me i just kind of described it a team chat there is currently a poll were gonna do a vote who wins cyberpk or indium right now theyre sixty percent fifty eight percent for origium 43 for cipher pk oh 48 to 52 percent 49 percent for cyber vk no way no way 55 percent for cyber vk 45 for oh lets go cyber did you send your community over no i didnt say anything i really didnt cyber bk takes this one guys 56 percent to 44 okay so its 10 for cypher in her engine this next one guys is going to be interesting i want you guys to step in your locker right now i want you to pick your best looking skin combo the most visually appealing whatever it is your favorite there is 30 seconds on the clock that im gonna add in two seconds and when the time runs out if youre not out you automatically lose that round starting now 25 24 15 14 13 12 11 ten nine eight seven original sets out six five four cyphers out okay here we go were gonna start with the ring jim i think it goes uh of course the color matches which is super nice very very nice aesthetic there visually appealing no doubt i do like blue so im a little biased over here cypher coming in with the flame version of the renegade raider nothing og or anything like that but he does match with the wings which is a different combo and hes even got an emote at it on top original didnt even think of the emote so we gotta give him there and hes got the ghost rider pickaxe so three separate bundles you could say and they all match so with all that knowledge being said can we put another poll in the chat a team and you guys are going to vote cypher at 200 votes original at 365 oh theres currently 36 percent to 64 percent for orindium theyre turning on me cyber pk making a comeback theres about 30 seconds left in the poll its 593 votes to 808 looks like oringium is going to take this one one to one one to one right now i want you guys to create a a person thats gonna be most likely featured in an upcoming film if you think of something thats releasing at the end of this year next year what is a character marvel dc thats going to have a movie batman has been in blue right yeah he he is he is mainly blue youre right whoever enters first of course will be the favorite going into the vote both players still in the outfit okay orindium steps on out cypher pk checking out all possible outcomes for a potential movie coming out in 2021 2022 45 seconds on the clock right now starting now 43 wheres the web oh there it is five seconds on the clock timer is officially up there it is perfect okay we all know what movie this is like i already know and thats how you know its a good skin combo so we have a reindeer hes fighting crime spider oh spiderman oh avengers he made it pretty obvious and i totally missed that i gotta be honest though and this is not even being biased this is pretty creative when it comes to spiderman hes even got the back bling and the only thing thats questionable is the pick x but it is actually a webbed one i know its a halloween themed web one but you gotta remember origium was the first one to come out so he he was a little quicker cypher took a little more time but no doubt the time was

9vD0BYBh5c4,covid19 how tech will transform your kids education  the economist,Education,for centuries this is what school for most kids looked like but in 2020 all that changed the covid19 pandemic created the largest disruption to education in modern history as teachers scrambled to get their classes online and parents developed a newfound respect for their kids’ teachers no that’s not a “t” that’s an “x” no this is an “x” but out of the disruption has come a realisation of technology’s potential… to transform one of the most important sectors for the future of the world summer camp has long been a tradition for american kids wholesome weeks away in nature to focus on sports or science or even space this summer though there’s a new camp the covid catchup camp for students like these when the pandemic hit their classes switched to online which wasn’t easy my pandemic school year was chaotic i could just like kind of do whatever i wanted because like the teachers couldn’t see me so like i’ll be eating in class sometimes falling asleep you know i have to share like the living room with my sister and her class was extra loud i did not like zoom some schools in san francisco were closed for inperson learning for more than a year and so the city decided to lay on extra  summer classes for all publicschool children our children particularly our very poor and lowincome families all had a very difficult time with distance learning not because they didn’t have the technology or the equipment but because they didn’t have the support to stay engaged in distance learning nor the structure at home to provide that support for them and so as a result we very quickly came together and created the summer together initiative last year was a year of loss and this summer we were determined for this summer to be a year of recovery by midapril 2020 14bn students were out of school and university across 190 countries by the start of 2021 schools had been wholly or partly closed for about twothirds of an academic year while office workers transitioned to remote working fairly easily it was a different story in schools tamara gilkes borr is the economist’s us policy correspondent but she used to be a teacher when i heard that schools were shutting down with maybe a day of notice i just couldn’t even imagine how i would have picked up the pieces so quickly and continue to teach my students we barely had enough working computers when i was a teacher while new technologies transformed working life in many sectors education has been notoriously slow to digitise classrooms today looked the same as they did decades ago even though parents often say that they want an innovative new type of education for their children when they walk into the classroom they often want to see the things that they saw when they were children so there’s often pushback against a new kind of education and there was pushback from teachers too many of whom were sceptical about technology that didn’t centre on facetoface learning in general education doesn’t change much because there’s a high cost to being wrong why change something up when the alternative could be so much worse but the pandemic sparked a techceleration in education as schools rushed online 24m learners in america were given emergency internet access the british government handed out more than 1m devices to students some schools even put wifi boosters on buses and drove them around towns as demand rocketed the edtech sector responded designing apps and software to aid teachers rather than replace them once teachers had to suddenly become virtual there was an appetite to get better technology in the classroom and then edtech had an opportunity not only to serve those customers but then they were able to get even better user data and improve their products for a unique subset which is teachers in the classroom the amount of money spent on edtech globally is expected to double… from almost 200bn in 2019 to more than 400bn in 2025 okay so today we are going to be focusing on maths these students are getting a personalisedlearning experience… thanks to an app on their laptops the software is called century it was created by priya lakhani a former barrister turned tech entrepreneur so century is a blend of artificial intelligence and machinelearning technology with neuroscience and learning science the idea is that it can personalise and differentiate for every student no matter what age what course what language and it can then use big data analytics and provide educators with instant insights deep intervention insights as to what they need to do at the point of time to help to increase a student’s outcome on a teacher dashboard it will allow us to see the children where they’re at how many nuggets they’ve completed and their average score once we‘ve done that we can then go into it a bit deeper and find out what the nugget is they’re doing how they’ve done on it what questions they’ve got right where they’re struggling at if they’ve skipped any questions  so we can really analyse that data priya created century as a way of addressing the problems she saw in the education sector we were still delivering a very onesizefits all education every child deserves a personalised differentiated experience but that’s really really difficult nearly impossible to provide in every educational setting the second issue was that teachers spent more than half of their time 60 of their time micromarking microassessing  trying to do the admin that was related to the children and not actually spending most of the time teaching before we would have to spend hours and hours marking we don’t have to do that now it shows us the data and we can see whether it’s green amber red we can see where the children are working at and we can then pick up on those points to help the children with children in britain already spending on average almost four hours a day online… some may worry about increased use of technology in the classroom… but laurie davis reckons it’s crucial although all children have a laptop we are not on it all day everyday we manage what we are doing and we implement it into our learning in a blendedlearning approach at the end of day every job out there now is using some sort of computer so we need to lay those foundations and if that is how ai develops to give those children a better future then i’m excited about that journey tech is also being used in an attempt to revolutionise how teachers teach so today you are going to be talking with a group of five students these trainees at the university of virginia are practising their lessons not on children but on avatars when you’re a teacher the first time is really high stakes you’re working with real kids and you don’t often get a second chance to explain a complicated maths concept and so what these simulations help us do is give our beginning teachers the chance to actually practise that and then do it again once they’ve gotten feedback i saw you use a lot of talk moves in probing the students’ thinking and this is a pretty advanced kind of discussion skill the software is designed by tech company mursion behind the scenes a digital puppetmaster plays the role of the children that’s a good question um you know what i’m going to say fruit loops i’d eat fruit loops everyday but the developers of the software hope that in future the avatars can be programmed to think for themselves the pandemic has also raised questions about whether children need to be taught in a classroom at all for twins julia and colin mecey technology has helped give them an altogether different learning experience they attend a virtual public school are you taking british and world literature which provides them with the equipment they need to learn remotely so i’m taking a fine arts course so in my box i have clay and some paintbrushes and then some acrylic coloured paint julia moved to fulltime remotelearning during the pandemic  but colin was a trailblazer switching to eeducation in 2019 the environment of a oneonone in comparison to oneon30 is just a lot nicer i have a lot more contact with my teachers and the classes that are offered is just so much more than what is offered at normal public school like computer science for example i’ve been able to take more classes that interest me i think my grades have been better so i probably will have a better chance of getting into my dream colleges a recent survey found that nearly a third of american parents  say it’s likely their child will continue with remotelearning indefinitely it’s unclear to what extent fear of covid has influenced this decision but roughly 20 of districts in america are planning to offer some form of virtual learning even after the pandemic we can all agree that most students do better when they’re in the classroom but for some students having to do school remotely was a positive some students have anxiety issues and it was easier to work from home for example for dad mike the technology also allows him to keep better tabs on his kids’ progress then you actually start on wednesday normal classes during the pandemic many teachers told me that this is the first time  they’ve seen so much parent engagement and a lot of that is because parents are home listening to the lessons but also because they are engaging technology that makes it easier for parents to be up to speed not all students can afford the space and internet connection needed to study online which means increased use of remotelearning risks widening the digital divide ultimately the barrier to success for all edtech not just eeducation is financial for edtech to be successful there needs to be investment in the schools that currently are underresourced there needs to be a push to make sure that these schools have the proper internet access the facilities and everything else they need to be able to properly function with edtech if that doesn’t happen then we will see  inequities develop in the classroom and across schools the technology that education deserves should be technology that is as advanced if not more advanced than the technology that is applied to the banking sector and if you want that sort of technology in the education sector then you’re going to have to create a model that investors have an appetite for the pandemic has made clear the vital role played by teachers for many students the best place to learn is in the classroom but technology can and will play a vital role in aiding education teachers are seeing the benefit of being able to have a hybrid classroom and most importantly they’re seeing the skills their students are gaining that they wouldn’t have had otherwise and these are skills that i think we all agree these students will need for the future if you are interested in learning more about covid and education click on the link thank you

M2Aa16laoE8,se chat with pappu  papa  episode 01  masturbation  se education,Education,papa what is masturbation pappu pappu you forgot your bat why dont you go get it now whats he going to ask me yes father ahem ahem have you picked up your mother yet no father i spoke to mom shell reach home on her own what do you mean you didnt go to the station to pick her up no i had to pick pappu up from cricket club so aye aye if the ball lands here again youre not getting it back you dont care for your mother at all what if she gets lost why would she get lost shes come here so often what are you trying to say that she keeps landing up like an unwanted guest all the time why do you have to misunderstand everything i say considering the state shireen is in i have to be more responsible for pappu these days yes mr responsible father  go fulfill your responsibilities like no one else has ever experienced fatherhood before hello father hello mom have you reached yes im already with shireen you sound really upset what happened did you speak to mogambo yeah why is he like this mom how did you put up with him all these years dont talk like that hes your father thats the problem hes always been a father never a papa thats why id decided that ill never be a father ill be a papa a friend to my child good that youre not like your father ill talk to you later then papa tell me no what is masturbation see where being a papa got you now be a father like me dont be a father be a papa dont be a father where did you hear this word son yesterday on the tv someone was saying its intellectual masturbation oh phew ok thank god ok so ill tell you what intellectual means  son intellectual people are those  that i know i want to know the meaning of masturbation dont tell him scold him and shut him up yes son its umm its playing playing with yourself oh playing i also want to play masturbationmasturbation no son this is not an outdoor game its an indoor game its something grownups play how many people play this game this hmm you play it alone son alone wheres the fun in that hummmmmmmmmmmmmm but if he asks i have to tell him tell him what had you asked me that question id have scolded and shooed you away i knew that thats why i asked birju instead of you birju our househelp yes if i dont give pappu the right answer today he might go off and ask someone else but what did birju tell you dont ask dont ask what where are you lost pappu you remember the poem about jack and jill yes jack and jill went up the hill to fetch a pail of water now ill tell you a different story about jack and jill jack loved playing cricket just like you he had a little bat too he would bat and jill would bowl whenever they would meet they would play this game jack loved playing this game he wouldnt stop playing until he scored a hundred runs and got exhausted but papa thats two people no yes the story isnt over yet son one day jill went away somewhere and jack was left all alone and jill had even taken her cricket ball with her then what did jack do jack was very bored without jill he was very sad then he met a friend  johnny but even he only had a bat his friend ginny had taken his ball and left but he was happy he would never get bored how thats the trick that johnny taught jack when you dont have a ball you can imagine that your friend is with you and bat just think that your friend is with you and bowling at you from then on jack could bat whenever he wanted sometimes he would play a test match other times a oneday or a 2020 match he would play different strokes and be happy very well explained now be quiet he must have understood by now how can he understand anything from that i havent even gotten to the actual subject but papa this is imaginary cricket not masturbation yes i was just giving you an example now just assume that your male organ is your bat simple you mean my nunnu hi son its not called a nunnu it is the male sex organ or penis the female sex organ is called a vagina see males and females are partners just like mummy and papa are partners their sex organs are also partners if these partners are unable to meet each other for a few days for some reason they start feeling tense by playing with them ie by masturbation this tension can be reduced a little  so even girls masturbate  yes just like jack can imagine jill bowling jill can also imagine jack batting this is wrong this is not wrong this is not wrong or bad but its something that should be done in private why because this involves your private parts and you should only do this when you really feel a need to so when mama is on a business tour you also do this see got stuck in your own trap thats what you get for being a papa er if i feel the need to yes and grandpa is in pune right now and his jill is here so that means even he  dont tell him dont say it its a question of my mummy dad how are babies born pappu are you also expecting a baby uncle now imagine the usb chord is my male organ so thin do you want to kill us masturbation doesnt cause blindness hairfall or hairgrowth on palms masturbation cant damage your genitals unless you are iron man you will not go to hell if you masturbate masturbation cant get you pregnant you can literally not run out of sperm if you masturbate we swear women also masturbate and its okay too in fact some doctors say masturbation in moderation is actually good for health to find out whats intellectual masturbation tune in to news hour at 9 or goaskyourdad if you dont like share and subscribe to this episode i will

XEqNLHCa8l4,the boys cast celebrates emmys nominations and season 3 premiere  entertainment weekly,Entertainment,like anything in life when youre standing on the edge of that precipice and you have to make that choice it defines who you are and certainly for these for all of these characters they all get faced with that choice what i love about the show is i open up every script and at least once i say to myself ive never seen that before in my life i think one of the main themes that i get out of season three is um be careful what you wish for you just might get it he put some stuff in that script and hes hes written this character in a way that uh i had to call him and be like wait what do you want me to do how does this has this play in the i cant do that man when you have jensen ackles on board and you push him to a zone where he is so uncomfortable that hes making phone calls that youre in the right space laughter i did it anyway but you know thats what being on the boys is for i knew it was gonna be exciting i knew uh that this was gonna be something that uh this was gonna be he you know he was gonna kind of uncage me as well and he stretched it pretty i mean he we we broke some uh some barriers i think on supernatural early on certainly with with some of the gore that we had some of the horror aspects uh that television hadnt necessarily seen before so i think hes always looking to push the envelope um thats definitely his mo and now we get actual proof of that theres something that happens in the first episode that i cant say but i think like sets this once you see it youll know this kind of sets the stage for whats to come we find butcher in a very uh frustrated place you know hes really trying to juggle his responsibility to the promise that he made with becker to look after ryan and he has a pretty clear objective to get homeland so theres kind of a bit of an internal war going on there and to which way hes going to go you know every time we get a script im like i have no idea whats coming and every time i think theyve gone too far hashtag spearing a whale with a with a speedboat um it becomes you know something of a like like an iconic scene for the show or something incredibly memorable and they pull it off so so what do i you know im just an actor what do we know music i mean the big difference with between soulja boy and some of these other soups on the show is um this guy is not a hes not a polished uh performer in the sense that i think a lot of the soups are nowadays uh hes old school hes hes the original superhero you know hes hes from an era that is that is being close to forgotten uh a time a time passed you know he he was world war ii he you know partied with hefner the the playboy mansion like this is just a different type of uh of character and he he certainly represents i think a lot of that toxic masculinity that is that is so deeply rooted in in a lot of of what our society feels and so erics had a lot of fun with with that music music you hope it doesnt really involve you and you kind of do hope it involves you um but you open up the script and youre like what does eric kripke have for me today this is gonna be so exciting i dont even know if i can scoop i swear but you can bleep it okay the ethical and moral debate that is prompted for all of the characters this season is how far are you willing to go where is the line at what point do you become the thing that you are trying to destroy um and of course you know in making that choice youre either on this side or that side its impossible to wrap your head around uh around the current social and political situation in america its just bananas so its not it you know we we cherry pick the the elements that we want to involve uh the character and and theyre sure really i mean its you just cant cover you simply cant cover everything and one character cant represent everything so as i say that im thinking about things that are in season three and i cant wait for you to see but the fun thing about this season is that it really pushes all the characters to the limit like you have to make a choice which side are you on you know and as far as butcher butcher is concerned this season everybody else thinks theyre in a knife fight and he knows theyre in a gunfight and hes like come on wake up so there was a lot theres certainly a lot to pull from and it was interesting kind of mingling that history with this new idea of what a superhero is um you know i was saying im saying to somebody its it was interesting being the new kid on the block but playing the guy whos been there the longest you know having me nominations and and that sort of acclaim its crazy the thing that i liked about it the most was that the clip they showed for the emmy nomination was literally us driving a speedboat into a whale i love that shes like now the final nominations for best drama series the boys and it immediately cuts to me screaming uh going into a whale and then after that he goes the crown and i died i was like this is the most appropriate clip um to show for our show getting nominated for best drama theres all these serious categories going on and then its like was a bit of an outsider so um it was nice to be included in such a prestigious event were doing something really messed up and and something that makes us very um very happy in how delightfully uh picked up it is but to have to be recognized in that way was so cool my relationship to the show doesnt change because of what amy voters might think i think the material is the material and it has been since day one and you know its one of the things that im proud of about the show is that it doesnt pull punches and uh and its not shy about what the subject matter that it wants to tackle to a certain extent is really kind of beyond our immediate area of concern were just focused on making the best show we can and push the limits and continuing to deliver something to the audience that they havent seen before but thats the exciting thing about working with kripke is he pushes your comfort levels and and i i enjoy that as as a as a performer and i also enjoy that as an audience member um he takes risks and he expects his his characters and and his actors to go along with him somehow that mans mind manages to create new levels of homicidal maniac the boy season 3 is the most insane season of tv i think ever filmed im trying not to be hyperbolic but it is really really truly insane if youd like to play it safe then hes definitely not a showrunner you want to be you want to be in business with music you
IeOd4_6kI30,the ultimate xbox mystery tech,Tech, oh my god grunts  is that a cyber quad crowd cheering thud sound  ooh laughing thud sound  ken so this is not the real cyber quad this is like the we went to toysrus and found like the miniature version  rest in peace  ken but tesla still sells it msrp 1900  oh my god i dont think i can get this up by myself  matt i believe in you  i dont  matt to rephrase i believe in watching you struggle  ken yes that  ready and okay i cant im just gonna open the box just that im gonna open the box  matt what if we have to return it  im opening the box all right one cyber quad has been assembled  how fast is this supposed to go  ken 10 miles an hour okay  oh oh okay it has lights thats cool all right onward quad electric motor sound wait this is gonna be squeaking noises door opening  ken oh he is really going for it beeping sound there he goes explosion sound effect accelerating sound excited laughter  oh oh oh oh oh oh oh okay warped voices  austin how does 10 miles an hour feel huh chill music  hows it going getting some cardio in laughs chill music rewind tape sound  josh can you pop a wheelie  ken do you want to  i cant do a wheelie but i can definitely put it sideways  oh oh ohhh  austin keep it going  josh wow  i believe in myself  yo if you just got the power of friendship and belief you can do anything thats what anime has taught me  austin good advice ken ill race you  feels very weird on my body shouting gibberish  vroom vroom mother beep laughing breathing heavily  hello and welcome friends to austin catching boxes for the first time in his life oh oh this is my item thanks all right so this is something that i backed on indiegogo i think a year ago so the xbox series s is a great little console but you know whats missing portability which is where the xscreen comes in do you remember the ps one with the display that you attached to the top yeah its that same idea for the series s however while this is not an officially licensed microsoft product from what ive seen from the many many indiegogo backer updates ive gotten over email the last year they put a lot of serious time and effort into developing something which will actually make sense  ken serious time  serious development now ill be honest i backed this long enough ago that i dont remember how much i spent on it kaching you plugged this into the series s it takes advantage of the hdmi and the usb however you are gonna be losing your second usb as well as your ethernet i guess its fair enough but you do still have access to your storage expansion and your power and to be fair you still do have an additional usb port on the front so you can charge your controller and whatnot  yeah thats just not lining up right mm  matt if you get a running start im sure you could  oh i got it i got it okay took a little bit of persuasion first thing the color match is very close but not perfect this i would say is a very tiny shade of white off its a touch more sort of beige versus white how does it look when you close it i mean that actually  ken thats really good  thats not bad  ken i like that  whats the stand for so open the xscreen flat lift front of xbox and attach feet ohhh so its like this  matt yeah so you can  thats thats cool  matt it gets to eye level  im now much more convinced that this is totally cool  ken oh that is awesome its like a little kiosk  matt you are blowing hot air directly into your face but  ah thats fine dude the series s its warm air all right does this fit in here altogether  ken i would hope so  it does nicely actually and then i guess you could put your extra power cables and whatnot here  ken oh that is that is a cool package whoa  all right lets turn on the xbox i mean i will say the viewing angles are not bad also its a its a matte display its not glossy i havent played the game yet im looking i think this is this this this is feeling like a good product to me right now  2jz you cant go wrong  game character turn around if it is safe to do so  ken ooh the sound an 116 inch display completely will mask any of the deficiencies in the performance of the series s because 1080p on a display thats this small is gonna look super super sharp  ken the pixel density is way high on this  yeah i will say this layout does blow hot air towards you i actually didnt think it was that noticeable but when you have the series s directly facing towards you you do notice it  huh  okay hang on lets try it in the standard configuration huhhh the series s laptop racing car engine  im not used to playing games like this close so it actually feels a little bit weird it does work though  ken but its good the screen its good that the screen will go back a little more yeah  yeah i could definitely like lean it back and honestly the fact that its anti glare especially here in the studio where we have so many studio lights actually does help quite a bit supposedly if i close this screen and if ive set it up correctly it will turn off the xbox so theres the only way to find out right and power off sound  oh thats cool this video is sponsored by kamikoto living life

6oIlGhTgaKo,moms basement upgrade  intel 5000 extreme tech upgrade,Tech, ooh whoa now i wont say that chase is a gamer nerd who lives in his mothers basement cause thats a a mean hurtful stereotype but hes not really leaving me a lot of choices i mean look at him this is your parents house chase  yeah it is i couldnt move out because of covid so you know im stuck in here for a little bit longer  yeah all i hear is unintelligible mocking  im not trying to pay rent upbeat music  i got to say as far as basement man caves go its looking pretty good we got the mini fridge we got the tv with the playstation 4 im lovin the decor in here and of course chase already has an absolutely sick gaming setup which sort of raises the question what are we going to do to transform this space  we are going to be upgrading the computer its already pretty good but you know it can always be better we got some even better hardware than i currently have and were going to be putting in some new furniture and rearranging it so its going to be kind of a big change but its not just the computer its a lot of other little things as well  lets check out the setup here so youre rocking the 2080 super  wow youve got like dominator platinum memory what the hell are we even upgrading about this thing  i dont know how to describe it every once in a while the graphics driver does like to crash in fact it happened last night but i have a feeling that it had more to do with cold war being a little jank sometimes than the computer itself  now something you guys might not know about chase is that while here at linus tech tips were were gamers chase is a gamer unless your name is david or edzel or luke hes probably gonna make you look stupid in pretty much any game so i have two agendas here one is to help him reach his peak gamer potential and number two is to maybe find some way to sabotage him a little bit for the next time we play hows he going to bungie that  thats my only mouse at the moment so dont break it linus  thats okay you got lots of controllers rocking the playstation 2 rocking the other more different playstation 2 you lied you do have another mouse this is how we sabotage him now lets have a look at what were going to be doing in terms of upgrades okay some things are going to be legit upgrades this is intel extreme tech upgrade which is obviously brought to you by intel and were going to be going full bore with a core i9 11900k processor so were going one of those and rtx 3080 this is going to be among the fastest gaming machines money can buy but were also doing some stuff thats more tailored to chases personal preference like this sony trinitron 20 inch crt tv chase yeah 20 inch  20 inches wow thats like some big donger crt at least you know from the side  were going to be upgrading some of the furniture i dont have a tv stand so were going to be changing out the coffee table for this tv stand here linus i see some rugs  yeah were going to get some rugs unfortunately i dont have one in the room at the moment the monitor as well thats like a 27 inch i think its like 200 something hertz so thats a bit of an upgrade its going to be really nice were putting in some nanoleaf light bulbs so thatll be sick and were doing a bit of a retro mod on the ps2 so were going to be putting a hard drive in it and then you can use this memory card to rip your games to write to the hard drive and play them off of that so no more no more of a need for cds  that is sick for those of you who are new to the series intel is providing 5000 us dollar budgets for tech makeovers for my staff and chase hes getting a lot of bang for the buck here and we havent even talked about the desk yet man were going to have to haul a ton of stuff out of there better get started chase i had considered going with a automatic adjusting desk but they were just hella expensive so i didnt want to spend that  if it doesnt give more fps its not making its way into this setup ill set up to build here then and what are we doing i noticed we have a new case but you mentioned reusing that one  the plan right now is were going to take most of the guts out of this computer put them in the new case take all the new parts and put them back in this case were going to leave in the storage and the aio cause it fits really nicely i dont want to touch it at the moment  so basically you hate me and you want me to have to build two computers instead of just one  its two for the price of one so you know its pretty good  at least i dont have to paint the wall okay  you just need the computer right so  i guess yeah crashing oh god what just  i didnt screw in the side panel  i see that wow did dbrand just send you a bunch of sticker bomb wrap chase yeah i had to cut it myself linus yeah i see that chase if you dont look too closely it looks really good linus yeah about that do you have the chocolate power supply from tech showdown chase i have a receipt  you got a receipt huh chase yeah or i had  had  the plan for the second computer is im probably going to put unwrite on it and im going to run some game servers and possibly a windows vm and figure out something else to do with it  not your fault you already had a decent computer  im not going to water cool it i feel like i would not maintain it very well knowing me  i mean your machines in far better condition than davids was chase thankfully my dogs are maltese so they dont really shed that much i had to get a usb 30 header adapter because the cable that comes with the case doesnt fit with the sleds for the ssd there  its really tight i cant get it off oh everything is totally under control your computer will be all in one piece when were done  well we got two of them so as long as one of them works were good  there we go hey boards coming out does the dope special edition ram stay on this board chase no we got an extra ram and i definitely have a receipt for that linus yeah i was going to say this looks its from the office too do you have any specific rationale behind the choices here like 11900k thats pretty obvious you just wanted more fps but what about like the tuf z590 motherboard for example  i didnt feel like spending any more money than what the tuf was worth even as part of the upgrade so thats why i went with that one and the 3080 because its the 3080 and i didnt want to buy a 3090  okay fair enough and i guess as far as ftw3 ultra goes it was the one we could get chase it was the one we could get  thats typically the story with these intel extreme tech upgrades thanks evg because at msrp you know these will fit in a 5000 upgrade at scalper prices his is the 5000 upgrade chase may not care about them but a couple of really great features from my point of view are the inclusion of 25 gig ethernet thats going to be more relevant in the future especially if hes going to be running an unraid nas separately in the house and he wants to have really quick access to those files and of course support for pci express gen four storage today your storage doesnt make a huge difference to the gaming experience but give it a little bit of time with microsofts direct storage and all of a sudden the gpu could need high speed access to your storage drive and thats going to enable that now ive got to scavenge the m2 ssd from the old board i actually dont know what hes running so well see if its gen four or not  wish i had a drill but this is fine  we got the old ssd out the good news is 660p one terabyte good drive solid drive the bad news is its not pci express gen four so what were going to do is were going to install it in one of the two pci express gen three slots and we will leave this open for a future gen four upgrade how do you have so many standoffs and none of them are the right one  i dont know it could have been for this cooler but im not sure  no i dont think so  i clearly gave someone the wrong hardware but it mustve worked out cause they never contacted me  this is a little awkward chase i know that you spent probably a lot of money on this special edition dominator platinum and you had intended to keep using it in the gaming rig this vengeance lpx is substantially faster this is 3600 cl14 chase throw that in there then  you also dont need more than 16 gigs of ram in your gaming rig and this is like a 32 gig kit so that goes into the server i think chase no problem  dominator platinum home server with unraid  i got a good deal on it i didnt actually spend that much on the ram  well its not that fast its just fancy looking so its fine yeah you got all flash you got no dash but now youve got dash too that moment when you buy the fanciest most specialist ram and then you swap it out for some basic vengeance lpx  im just installing the cable management tray i think its a little short so might have to drill holes might not well see  well you might not have any mounting hardware but at least we can kind of jam the motherboard in here just gotta just gotta kind of oop finangle it a little dont worry chase itll be fine he looks like the nervous expectant father while his wifes delivering her baby  i know for a fact youre going to have a hard time plugging in the power cable thats for the cpu specifically  i promise you i will have that in in 30 seconds okay timer go theres half theres the other half chase im glad youre building the computer and im not  i did cheat a little bit the motherboards not really screwed in so theres some wiggle room man so far this is the easiest extreme tech upgrade yet  all right we did it its good enough its really just to hold some cables so its a little jank but i dont care that much so one of the things that were doing to the playstation 2 i have is were going to install a hard drive now the problem is the new hard drives that are sata dont connect to the old network adapter that you can get so we had to get a third little mini board and we got to install it to this install that to the ps2 plug in the memory card and then were good to go  im just waiting for logistics to bring me the mounting hardware that i need for the cpu and then i am good to throw the graphics card in oh actually and one other thing chase is going for a live gamer duo capture card which will presumably allow chase do you stream chase i do stream a bit linus this has two hdmi inputs which allows you to have your camera as well as an external device such as a game console plugged in so nintendo switch goes in here camera goes in here and boom the pc can do all the streaming i mean he talked about doing a dual pc streaming setup or something like that but they can be a bit of a pain in the butt nice capture card does up to 240 fps 1080p input one supports 4k and the other one does not at all and then it does pass through 4k 60 if you really to  hdmi one is going to be yeah any of the retro game consoles or like the ps4 and then the second one will just be my camera input im currently using a webcam if you can see over there on the desk and im going to be upgrading to a camera  whats your twitch username then  toomuchcontra no spaces no caps  can you really ever have too much contra  i finally got the cover off i had a couple more screws that were really small but after that it popped right off not the ones on the back those are actually for screwing it into the playstation 2 but now i got to remove this little daughterboard that they have i guess thats what you would call it so thatll take a couple more screws and hopefully it pops right off  oh okay oh thats super cool not as cool as this 3080 im about to install though chase its pretty powerful  good flex chase you just unplug them all just like that cause we dont need it anymore this one board will take over both functions because it uses the power and then i guess thats for the data so its a pretty cool mod i just realized after taking this one out this board actually has a ribbon for us so i have to take the ribbon out of the main board so were going to do that in a moment seems fine that looks like thats how you install it so were going to go with that i dont think im supposed to slide it into place  so they pop out and then you push them into lock  oh okay  yep no problem so this needs to come off this is the only one  no no its good thats what we want to keep that  oh okay this one stays yeah thats a free tech tip all right lets get this graphics card gasps i think itll be okay though because these hard drive cages shouldnt interfere there we go all right chase chase yup  how married to this case are you im a little concerned about cooling this is a solid front panel case this is an rtx 3080 i dont know if its going to be up to the task chase if its not its not  okay well find out soon enough  i do really like the case i had a really hope that we can use the computer in there but if its too powerful too much heat well have to swap it but you know thats a risk im willing to take at the moment the board has been swapped im just putting the metal plate back on im going to put in the rest of the screws and we should be good to go  now we can throw this puppy on here thermal paste is already on and i have confirmed these are correct which means were pretty much done its on there pretty good i think this rig might actually be ready to boot up  the network adapters installed and the hard drive is inside so all we got to do is plug in this memory card and boot it up and we should find out if its going to work or not  aw that is sweet pc gaming first all right lets see if it fires up look at that rgb boys ridiculous hey there it is nice okay weve got the m2 weve got the two sata ssds weve got the hard drive weve got our 16 gigs of ram everything looks like it is behaving as we would expect  lets try the ps2 next its actually good that you plugged in the computer because we do need to power the retro tank actually  ayyy  free mcboot there we go  free mcboot  we gotta get a game to install it right  sure  all right disney extreme skate adventure well thats a top priority why dont we just chase that is 100 a top priority linus why dont we put this one on  i heard that transferring hard drive games can actually take a while if you do it directly on the ps2 so we could be we could just let it sit for a while  so can you just pop the hard drive throw it in the computer transfer everything and then put it back in there  yeah you can totally do that i think thats what most people do linus time left 388140 hours i mean what even is that chase its just an estimation dont worry about it  44 years so chase by the time youre my age it might have ripped chase nice  ow i stabbed my finger may i ask why you provided me with all of these pure wings 2 120mm fans chase can you put them in the top  i can chase yes  all right i think im only going to be able to put two in the top but thats already going to be five fans in a meshify case i dont know how effective this top exhaust is going to be its right next to an intake and im going to move these 140s down i think this plastic piece right here just yeah there we go pops out since this machine is going to be running unraid its obviously going to have some hard drives in it were going to want to make sure they get some cooling so were just going to take this fan and give it a little one of those  i just need to make a little bit more room for myself over here so i can get the desk upright and take it apart a little bit before we haul it out of here  oookay  perfect all right  cool  and i will disassemble some of it so  yeah do you remember when ikea furniture was like this is a sick rig in its own rights sheesh remind me to be your little brother growing up cause like youre hand me downs man the couch goes here now its no less ugly at least its the first thing you see when you walk in the room  we lost one of the feet  whoops here hold on let me whoa no no wait  whoa whoa  hold on hold on let me  i cant game if i lose my finger  yeah dont worry i got you fam wait you cant game if you lose your fingers  oh bleep  oh here here we go down it comes okay  yeah it has to come up a bit but  i was going to say its a little linus sized chase yeah it can go higher perfect you know you got the tv got your main desk got the other desk  yeah its frickin awesome i mean you might even be able to stream and like game on your playstation or whatever on the main tv  just tilt this bit yeah  wait why do all the consoles live over here how do these go cconnect to the thing  well actually the switch might move  you mean you might switch up its location you know you dont have to laugh at my jokes  to give you credit i didnt laugh at any of the others so far laughter  not sure if supposed to make me feel better or  look at that  the system works  were a little high  yeah a little high  yeah actually i think that ones good  which one  the one that youre doing right now  yeah okay ahh this is going to be a nightmare to level  right now im installing the back plates on the monitors because we have like a two a dual monitor mounting arm so i can put that on the back of the desk and i dont have to use traditional stands it was a fairly cheap one off amazon but it should do the job we made sure that it was rated for the weight of the monitor  if we dont have the little slidey mount things one option is to just 3d print them option number two we take this mesh cable management thing down here and we just jam it in there chase how about we do that  ah hey chase im good were good  oh crap the cable managements on this side chase yeah well well spin the desk around later i just realized that because we put the desk in wrong we can actually attach the monitor arm before we flip it around so were were actually good to go in this aspect  im on the stairmaster chase trying to slide it on and it doesnt want to go this kind of juts out just enough take this off put it on first put the monitor on then screw it in how about you screw in the monitor and ill hold it in place right  brought my own ltt store screwdriver  not yet coming soon  whoa  oop  no no we good hey rock on  nice  cool this is great  okay we got to get the peels off im sorry andy  sorry andy how much was this 50 bucks  not even which could come back to haunt me in the future  oh yeah for sure  at the end of the day it was under budget so thats what had to happen bring it forward a bit  scooch it in  yeah thats fine  okay  i probably cause you know im gaming ill bring it pretty far forward  yeah you got to go all pro  why do you think my back posture is so bad  now im all selfconscious about it too okay i got the shoulders back right you like the thin mouse pad eh  do you know where that one came from  the office i assume  yes i had an exact same version of that and the middle had started to worn out i just ended up getting the exact same one linus but stolen from work  no we were giving them away  uh huh its amazing how many things i give away without knowing about it chase this is sick the desktop is way cleaner than it used to be  oh yeah for sure wheres the power adapter for the samsung wow thats a big power brick what the bleep chase well i got rid of two so ill take it  this is a hundred watt power adapter ah oh that was really close to falling on my face chase it did  no no it missed chase oh okay  if youre going to have the computer in the corner here we need this leveled chase all right give me one second yo dog i heard you wanted a level so i got you a level linus wow you leveled my level so i can level while i level get on my level chase you know what its not far off actually it could be different from one side of the table to the other this one has to come up for sure theres some weight on the top of it isnt there chase yeah  thats fine i can yeah there we go okay so is it level now chase still looks a little off linus okay oi  no its all good i just knocked something  watch your feet this thing will break your foot muscles oh god  i think you broke the front you know whats funny they warned us about that when we picked it up they said the front can break really easily  oh im sorry chase this thing is super old im really not that concerned i think thats the only thing youve broken and its not as bad as the bed so im happy linus hup metal clanging yelling andy linus did you just break my bed  so i almost forgot we have to remount a few things i have the camera were going to use as a webcam and then the thing you place it on its the sony alpha 5100 its clean hdmi and i can use a dummy battery thats all i need something about it being mirrorless too but im not a camera guy so i found it in a closet somewhere and i was like hey i could use this this cable management tray is doing wonders linus i know right  yeah linus so much stuff jammed in there it looks so clean under the desk and youll never accidentally kick anything and knock it over or whatever chase oh is that for the monitor  yeah its a usb 3b but its got this giant housing on it chase thank you samsung  we leave it like this forever i win our next gaming match  hold up hold up hold up  everyones happy  whats going on  thats so much better you can still see a little bit of jello though you can still see this one is a touch faster  at least one of the light bulbs is burnt out so i figured id just get some smart bulbs and replace them and get some rgb going if its not in the computer itll be the entire room we have nano leaf essentials here a19 or e26 they definitely fit in those sockets so no problem i think it was 35 each or something  35 each this is a hundred dollars in light bulbs per fixture  you got to go big for the upgrade so here we are  oh i think i got it  yep yep how many lmg employees does it take to screw in a light bulb linus you had a gamersnexus modmat the whole time and we didnt use it for a build surface  i like to live dangerously another piece of equipment straight from amazon super cheap not sure if its worth it basically it has four inputs and two outputs but the outputs is duplicated so the idea is that one always goes to the crt and then one always goes to the capture card so its just kind of a handy way to do that and you can have four consoles  and we have no idea what the av quality of this thing is  i didnt want to spend a lot on it i just wanted to see if it would work is that working  nope thats just the tv chase oh you know what i know why i didnt plug in the audio to the back its in the back of the tv  got you fam okay where is it at ow chase well its under the desk now  i see that  oh god  oh wow thats really loud its kind of like an inverse color thing you got going on the bottom right corner how much did i pay for this again chase like 150  the gamer vibe is real now  this is looking pretty good were getting what 70 fps  yeah considering that youre running like ray tracing ultimate  do we want to turn it off and see what it goes to  its probably worthwhile yeah  yeah all right linus there we go  yeah 120 thats pretty good considering this game really just seems to cap out in like a low hundreds this is cool you want to give it a shot  this is the part where we gain a greater appreciation for how good chase is as we watch me try to do it where are you boys at theres one  ooh no he was hiding all right that was pretty good  chase didnt even mention that part of the plan here is to have space for vr hes even got the headset already this is awesome this is way better and we didnt put the displates on the wall these look awesome  yeah not bad  not bad at all we mightve gone a little late on the shoot today the blueness of the shot is not just from the rgb lighting its also getting kind of dark outside but i love this setup its gaming essentials and anything goes you love your console gaming you love your pc gaming your modern gaming your retro gaming chase has pretty much got you freaking covered so thank you very much intel for sponsoring this 5000 extreme tech upgrade thanks to you guys for watching if youre looking for another video to watch hey maybe check out one of our previous intel extreme tech upgrades we alluded to that i had broken furniture on one of the previous ones maybe check out andys extreme tech upgrade

little hot i dont know if its the cheese they use the cheese blend or like more cheese flavor the sausage flavor is good the dough itself is cooked actually pretty well and then for their specialty pizza weve got keep forgetting the name were just gonna call it the powerful pepperoni there we go this one is better than this one and i know why like i said two little cheese it tastes like marinara sauce on some bread with a little bit of cheese this added the flavor if you need it at the kick the spice the extra saltiness this one was better dominoes overall first to the door and you know the good service and stuff with the little box im gonna give dominos a b that might change that might change im filming b dominos pizza youre a bee oh my god all right look at all this pizza that we got but next up were going to go with papa dollars ive had over 40 pizzas again another pizza restaurant that doesnt have a featured pizza right now but we went with music this is the epic stuffed crust one topping pizza well that is the specialty pizza and this should be the large cheese pizza right here we go no cheese pool i dont i i dont expect to get cheese pools in any of these pizzas today same thickness um here we go papa johns oh were getting deep into the pizza all these peaches are actually significantly different which is totally interesting thats a heavy boy while the crust is super super thick the actual pizza itself is actually looks more like a thin crust all right here we go epic stuff crush its kind of gross but look at that cross section i want to say thats a little even undercooked not to be gross but that is not the cheese yeah ill pull into the cheese that is the cheese its a little more brittle the hard part is this is the best part of the pizzas huh all right all right so papa johns dude all right okay it had like the opposite problem as dominos definitely that saltiness the cheese was more in your face more flavorful and stuff the sauce is like sweet its a very sweet marinara sauce i i dont like it im im not a fan of the flavor and if memory serves me right this is gonna be the same situation with pizza hut i think well find out papa johns i think is gonna go into a seat here yes i wouldnt i wouldnt order that again all right so little caesars here we go all right so on your right weve got a standard cheese pizza and then on your left my right weve got the uh batman calizoni its called the calzone okay so first up slice of cheese cross section this ones looking like its got a little less substance to it than dominoes and papa johns all right here we go little caesars all right were gonna move on to the batman calzone we have our first cheese full epic hey thats not how bad and thats what those are supposed to look like papa john we got the specialty pizza for variety i gotta be partial to the control group which is the cheese this was the worst pizza so far this was nothing special whatsoever this though the specialty pizza was good oh i know im going bias into this one should i get some crowd participation for this tier list im torn its between b and c too just let me know let me know what you think about the calzone oh my god its so good thats pretty good little caesars is coming up with an upset were going beats here that feels wrong that feels wrong because this alone id say d tier thats my gut feeling little caesars beat round table off the bat this ones looking distinctly different this looks like a pizza that i know this was their stuffed crust with crispy mini pepperoni oh interesting okay so were getting more than one stuffed crust today and also bonus points this is the first pizza that came with tables alright well first up here we go standard cheese the control group im just looking at some of this cross section and im not liking it im worried it looks very just like bready i dont think thats what pizzas crosssection should look like normally wheres the sauce theres like no sauce on this oh no all right and then this one is the stuffed crust mini pepperoni which also let me just say that structurally the way that popping down to their stuffed crust this looks like they just made a giant pizza and folded it over a couple times oh my gosh i need sauce theres like no sauce on these pizzas just it tastes like a cheesy bread round table what the heck i put round table at a deep i was expecting more out of it because i remember round two pizza being good back in the day the round table was so cool they also had like a little arcade section too and everything you could play games and stuff there no all right five pizzas down three more to go i guess well go in order of delivery pizza hut okay visually this is looking good this one is the spicy lovers i think its called the spicy lovers pizza no one else pizzas the hut all right well find out about that real quick before we dive in uneven cutting thats probably the most unevenly cut pizza of the day look at that if you order this pizza for a group of people some people are gonna be sad all right well im gonna go for the big slice because you know cause thats what everybody online expects me to do music im gonna grab a domino slice i gotta compare this back to bad all right take a look at these two different slices of pizza dominos versus pizza thats kind of what crust is more supposed to look like its got a little burn to it a little crisp you know this ones a little flappy i dont know if cam is picking it up but pizza is definitely the more oily thats dominoes that pizza music pizza its better i always thought of the dominoes over pizza person dominos is lacking cheese pizza hut has the cheese and actually i didnt even take it by the crust the crust is crusty all right before i get my verdict going for the specialty the spicy lovers the pepperoni chili peppers tons of pepper flakes spicy sauce so spicier than remember music this ones a game changer this is changing everything right now first first update that needs to happen this little caesars going to see here see the problem though with this situation though this is better than this is better than domino so they cant both be in beats here but to say that the dominoes is equal to papa johns i cant justify that i cant move costco to s here to make that up to space and round table i dont think its enough tier music oh no were going to move pizza hut to beetier dominos is moving down to seats here and little caesars for whatever reason i dont know why dont ask me i cant i cant make up my mind but little caesars are moving back to b tier what i dont know i moved it down the seats here and now it moved back to beat here because that calzone was damn good okay were moving on im excited now we are down to two more franchises and one ive never tried who behind the camera right now has had hungry however ive never heard of this brand but apparently they have over 500 locations so here is oh no dont judge the pizza bites crust this is their flatbread and we went with their three cheeser pepperoni pleaser wheres the pepperoni theres no pepperoni in the three cheese pepperoni pleaser oh my god cheese pizza control group going down the hatchet okay cheese pizza tons of sauce cheese is all right dont felt a little undercooked but it still is already a little bit crunchy on the outside like on the crushed crust part but before you grate it you got the three cheese flatbread music okay hungry howie yeah easy answer hungry house without a doubt cetera solid seeker the cheese has the right flavor but it was just too much sauce the breading felt cheap i think so i wasnt a huge fan of this one but this flat bread is actually pretty good we havent got much crunch today and that was crunch but because of the missing pepperoni false advertising without a doubt sea tear and last but not least we have california pizza kitchen before we even open the box the first part to note is these peaches are significantly smaller uh what do we got okay visually i feel like were getting into territory that wouldnt be considered fashionable traditionally like this is some good looking pizza so this one right here is what they call a traditional cheese pizza this one is the five cheese and fresh okay first up trying to control the cheese its definitely like a ricotta cheese yeah it tastes like ricotta ill go into detail later its the most stand out thing the biggest difference between the fast food pizza and i dont even know if these are handmade but they look handmade the crust you cant fabricate a good pizza crust and then here we go we got the um the five cheese and fresh can i just eat the crust dude this crust is so sad its just that nice chewiness its just so good okay california pizza kitchen this ones tough pardon me feels like shouldnt really be on this list not that its like mindblowing compared to everything else here but just it just feels like its like a different its a different category of pizza but we ate it it is on this list its going on this list and im going to give california pizza kitchen i have to give it an especially after saying what i just said california pizza kitchen is going to go eight here if we are doing a t list with more pizzas like this like going around the country the pizza spots that ive enjoyed or something or places like best pizza in the town type of places then this would definitely not be 18 that is all eight pizza joints that we got pizza from the big question is i need to redo money i kind of feel like i do i think i need to try the big three pizza dominos papa johns i think i need to blind taste test the big three right now ive got pizza height of beets here dominos at sea tier and papa johns a seat here am i tripping lets find out music all right here are three mini slices of pizza for the blind taste thats papa johns uh dominos and then pizza all right here we go okay i feel like i know this one is my smell i feel like a domino oh god next slice smells more burnt you have your thoughts um im gonna say my opinion for the um direct comparison im gonna figure this out ah last one all right im pretty sure i know which ones what if im correct and which one is what nothing changes id say the first two had the alternating problems the first one was lacking sauce it was just cheesy bread for the most part the second one is a sauce explosion would burn in my mouth honestly if that was papa johns the sauce wasnt as sweet as i was complaining about earlier on being a baby about it i guess um sauce wasnt bad and then the last one was a nice balance i think first one was dominos second one was papa johns and third one was pizza yep yeah lets go i mean at the end of the day selfexplanatory i think the big note or just california pizza kitchen didnt feel so much like a fast food pizza it definitely was an outlier little caesars got lucky today thank god for their batman calzone the pizza hut i think was the best out of the big three papa johns dominos hungry howies to me like seemed like a chucky cheese pizza and round table what happened dude used to always get around to it it was like a celebration at the end of like soccer season or something and the coach would buy everybody roundtable and youd play arcade games and street fighter and stuff and it was so cool its so fun but i guess the pizza wasnt so hot a lot of thought went into this cheerless so hopefully its uh decent so if you like stuff like this let me know im not going to become a tear lister whatever its fun for me and apparently its fun for you guys too a huge thanks to honey for sponsoring this video if you havent already tried honey out what are you doing go to joinhoneycom to download for honey for free today and start saving some money all right guys thanks for watching ill catch you guys in the next food challenge the batman cow zoney which is interesting if i if i had to make if i had to preguess by the preguess i would anticipate little caesars as the bottom of the tier list yes um but we had some surprises last time too it was like wendys or something that was a surprise last time with a little baby chicken sandwich it actually made sense

supply chain and youll find an oil palm tree likely here in indonesia the worlds biggest producer over the last decade vast areas of jungle have been cleared to make way for plantations the tradeoff was the promise of economic development but this joint bbc investigation has found palm oil producers supplying major global brands are depriving local communities of their share in the profits oil palm firms are failing to fully comply with promises and regulations that require them to share their plantations with local farmers as a result indigenous communities across the country are losing out on millions of dollars each year suta minha this joint investigation by the bbc the gecko project and by reveals the scale of the problem that sparked protests across the palm country tainted by this issue has flooded into the supply chains of major consumer goods firms like kelloggs johnson and johnson and mondelez music traces the path of the river his spear ready to strike today like most days he hasnt caught anything baby music one of the last nomadic tribes in indonesia for generations theyve lived off the sumatran jungle now his tribe lives here in these tents in a sea of oil palm trees according to his tribe when a palm oil company arrived here nearly 30 years ago they came with promises of prosperity they would take control of the communitys ancestral land but return more than half of it back now planted with oil palms a socalled plasma plantation the tribe would be able to harvest a wonder crop in growing demand across the globe but that hasnt happened the company that controls the plantation is part of the salim group one of indonesias biggest corporations the salim group and their subsidiaries turned down our interview requests but the indonesian palm oil association theyre part of denies theres a problem um in 2015 the plantation company on the orangurimbas ancestral land did sign this new written agreement in it they commit to providing the tribe with 1400 hectares of oil palms but by 2017 it still hadnt happened by then the orangumba had been waiting two decades frustrated some in the community including lina decided to occupy the palm oil plantation soon music the next night arm police raided the community rounding up anyone accused of taking part in the protest that had turned violent lena and 40 there they say they were assaulted by the police who did not respond to our calls palm oil from the salim group has been bought by companies including johnson and johnson and kelloggs they turned down our requests for an interview but in response to our findings johnson and johnson wrote that they take these allegations very seriously and have initiated their grievance process kellogg said the company would investigate the allegations and coordinate with their suppliers to determine the next steps parliamentarian daniel johan who tried to intervene on behalf of the orangumba says their case is not an isolated one our investigation found that on average over the last six years protests by communities claiming they have been exploited by palm oil firms have taken place every month when the palm oil industry began to rapidly grow in the 1980s companies taking part in government plantation schemes were encouraged to provide up to eighty percent of their plantation for local farmers so called plasma plantations by 2007 a new rule required all palm oil companies to provide a much smaller area for local farmers only 20 of their total plantation where the scheme worked it helped lift rural communities out of poverty giving them their own stake in an industry worth more than 50 billion us dollars each year globally but government figures obtained by our reporting team show across the country companies are failing to fully comply with the regulations consequences to get a sense of the scale of the problem we analyze government data we found that in just one province central kalimantan on the island of borneo companies have failed to provide a hundred thousand hectares of legally required community plantations or plasma thats almost the size of los angeles using conservative figures for the profits available from palm oil communities there are being deprived of an estimated 90 million dollars each year available government data suggests the picture is similar across the country the indonesian government turned down our interview requests but in a text message a senior official from the ministry of agriculture admitted that theres a problem that theres low levels of fulfillment of community plantation obligations rita de hallas from the dayak tribe on the island of borneo decided to take matters into his own hands back in 2009 a palm oil company called palmdale arrived in his region of west kalimantan with a partnership offer around 900 farmers entered a plasma contract with the company and handed over their land but as the years went by the community says they havent received any profits from the plantation the tandoori music music in 2007 rita blocked one of the plantations main roads stopping a truck loaded with palm oil from leaving he was jailed for six months from behind bars he and four other farmers decided to sue the company for breach of contract in august last year they won their case in the supreme court the judges ruled that palmdale was in breach of its contract by failing to pay rita and the others their promise share of the plantations profits say palmdale did not respond to our interview requests music palm oil from their plantations has been bought by a number of multinational companies including mondelez the maker of cadbury and oreo products in response to our findings they said they have a goal of no exploitation of local communities and are speaking with partners and experts to understand the issues better and how they should address them indonesias super rich list is stacked with palm oil billionaires and companies have seen their profits soar as global prices reach record highs but for the orang rimba the weight for their cut of the fortune goes on music to feed her children orange elda city menina collects oil palm beds left over after a harvest sometimes selling these can earn her just enough to buy rice music theyve been cut out of the palm oil boom hello music after our investigation was released in indonesia the

6DYgImG1CKo,biological anthropologist answers love questions from twitter   tech support  wired,Tech, the human brain is not built to deal with more than about five to nine options after that the brain just spaces out you choose nobody hi im dr helen fisher im a biological anthropologist i study love and this is love support upbeat music this person calls herself ruth bader love at first sight is probably bull beep right wrong love at first sight is extremely easy to explain this is a brain system its like the fear system or the anger system and it can be triggered instantly you gotta be ready for it and we all carry in our head what i call a love map an unconscious and conscious list of what youre looking for in a partner but the moment comes youre ready to fall in love you see somebody from across the crowded room or wherever they fit within your love map you go over and you speak to them they smile sweetly at you they say something thats funny or charming or interesting and boom instantly triggered that brain circuitry for romantic love attachment that other brain system grows slowly you have to get to know somebody to begin to feel attachment but romantic love can be instant yes this is from issyleen who created love this shit is too much to handle well love evolved for millions of years we have formed partnerships pair bonding or monogamy mono means one and gamy means spouse one spouse thats all it means to scientists people are also adulterous but they form partnerships 97 of mammals do not pair up to rear their young people do its a hallmark of the human animal and along with the evolution of pair bonding came the evolution of the human brain systems for the sex drive romantic love and feelings of deep attachment i and my colleagues have put 15 people into a brain scanner who had just been rejected in love and the brain goes just the wiring just goes crazy i mean when youre madly in love with somebody and youve been dumped its one of the worst experiences i mean people pine for love they live for love they kill for love and they die for love and i do think that it is an addiction because we found activity in a particular brain region its called the nucleus accumbens that particular brain region is active in all of the addictions all the substance addictions all the behavioral addictions like gambling and it becomes just as active when youve been rejected in love and when this person says this shit is too much to handle well we all do handle it the vast majority of us do get over it and ive been able to prove in the brain that time does heal because it is our survival it is a survival mechanism it evolved millions of years ago and it will be with us millions of years from now romantic love is primordial its adaptable and its eternal so this shit will always be too much to handle but will do it anyway this person is skzismyuniverse how to try and fall in love during a pandemic dating apps arent really doing it theyre doing it for a lot of people about 40 of singles in america said that they met their last first date on the internet the two mistakes that they make perhaps this person is making them to first mistake is they binge the human brain is not built to deal with more than about five to nine options after that the brain just spaces out you choose nobody so the first thing that youve got to do is after youve met nine people and thats what this person needs to do get off the internet site get off of it and get to know at least one of these people better the more you get to know somebody the better you tend to like them so number one dont binge number two think of reasons to say yes instead of no we have this big brain region linked with negativity bias were built to remember the negative and when you have just met somebody you know so little about them that you overweight those few things that you know and so youll say oh i dont know she likes cats i like dogs never gonna work get over it think of reasons to say yes i call it positive illusions the ability to overlook what you dont like about somebody and focus on what you do this is from somebody called theejenbunny2 can you truly be in love and cheat alas you can you know these are different brain systems sex drive and romantic love or different brain systems and you can be mad madly in love with somebody and also sleep around as a matter of fact i do think that the brain is unfortunately built for both ive looked at adultery in 40 cultures and you see it everywhere in the world even in places where you could get your head chopped off for it we seem to have the ability to be madly in love with some person and deeply attached to that person and also sneak around i call it a dual human reproductive strategy a tremendous drive to fall in love form a partnership and have your babies and also to cheat next up is from rodneyjgavino google search how does attraction work why him why her why do you fall in love with one person rather than another theres all kinds of cultural reasons we tend to fall in love when the timing is right we tend to fall in love with somebody whos around proximity is important we tend to fall in love with somebody from the same ethnic and socioeconomic background somebody of the same level of education and theres four basic brain systems that each one of them is associated with a constellation a suite a group of personality traits dopamine serotonin testosterone and estrogen systems i created a questionnaire to see to what degree you express the traits in all four of these basic brain systems its now been taken by over 15 million people in 40 countries and im able to watch whos naturally drawn to whom if youre very high on the traits in the dopamine system risk taking novelty seeking curious creative you tend to be drawn to people like yourself if you are very high on the traits of the serotonin system you tend to be traditional conventional follow the rules respect authority detail oriented rather than theoretical youre also drawn to people like yourself so if youre very high testosterone you tend to be analytical logical direct decisive good at things like math engineering computers music musics very structural and youre drawn to your opposite high estrogen people and this is men as well as women many more are women in that category they tend to see the big picture they think long term theyre very imaginative very good at reading posture gesture tone of voice we all express all four systems this is what the problem is with most personality questionnaires today they put you in one bucket or another we express all four brain systems and the traits in each but we express some more than others now theres all kinds of circumstances where people are drawn to their opposite in ways because they had a bad love affair theyve been running around all their lives and now they want something more stable so they go for the traditional even if theyre very risk taking thats human variety but the bottom line is theres patterns to culture theres patterns to nature and theres patterns to personality this is from sadshortfriend2 how does someone know if theyre feeling romantic or platonic attraction theres a real list of traits that are associated with feelings of romantic love and they are not associated with platonic attraction the first thing that happens when you fall in love is somebody takes on special meaning everything about them becomes special the car they drive looks different from every other car in the parking lot the house that they live in the street that they live on the music that they like when its a platonic attraction not everything is special about this human being you like them i mean youre attracted to them you find them amusing or funny or interesting but youre not obsessed with them but if you had to think about one just one trait that is most distinctive between the two when youre madly in love with somebody in a romantic attraction you are obsessed and in a platonic attraction you dont think about them night and day this person is reprogramcoach is online dating killing romance it cant kill romance this is a basic brain system it evolved millions of years ago its like hunger or thirst or anger or fear you cant kill romance my next up is from nitabeater i wonder whats actually going on through our bodies when we think were in love like what chemicals are enhanced i and my colleagues have put over 100 people into a brain scanner who were madly in love the first group were people who were happily in love the second were a group of people who were rejected in love and the third was a group of people who were in love long term so we put these people in the brain scanner we had them look at a photograph of their sweetheart and also a neutral photograph so we could compare the brain under both circumstances and we were able to find that everybody whos madly in love rejected in love or in love long term begins to have activity in a tiny little factory near the base of the brain called the ventral tegmental area its way at the base of the brain and that brain region actually makes dopamine and sends dopamine to many brain regions giving you that focus the motivation the obsession the craving of intense romantic love and whats interesting to me is that little factory the vta lies right next to the factory that orchestrates thirst and hunger thirst and hunger keep you alive today romantic love enables you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time and start the mating process and send your dna into tomorrow this is from catchmyfly do you believe in soulmates if so do you believe you can have more than one yes and yes i do believe in soulmates i do not believe you can have more than one at a time so now what is a soulmate i think what this person means is somebody who its a true love youre not gonna sleep with other people youre not thinking of going anywhere you might even consider dying for him or her it is a very deep genuine attachment intense feeling of romantic love and i think that this is summed up best by a poet from the 15th century in india named kabir the lane of love is narrow theres room for only one and indeed when youre madly in love its with only one person i do believe you can have a soulmate i think that you may have a series of soulmates but i dont think you can have more than one soulmate at a time from somebody called dancewithvoices why dont people associate love with the heart why not the penis or the sternum there may be a physiological reason why it has been associated with love and that is theres a lot of characteristics a lot of things happen when you fall madly in love and one of them is the heart can really pound when youre really nervous about something i mean when youre madly in love not only do you feel that ecstasy euphoria sleeplessness loss of appetite obsessive thinking about the person craving for emotional union but also all kinds of physiological responses weak knees maybe a pounding heart it really started in the 1300s with giotto in a painting prior to that there were a lot of uses of the shape of the heart in fact as early as 5000 years ago in the indus valley they were drawing things that looked like the shape of a heart and at that point it was the seed of a form of parsley plant or an ivy leaf but it became associated with romantic love probably with the painting by giotto in 1309 this is from jay at 53k1 i lust hard and lose interest quick how does that work well youre not ready to fall in love weve evolved three distinctly different brain systems for mating and reproduction one is the sex drive linked with testosterone in both men and women the second is romantic love weve been able to prove this is linked with the dopamine system in both men and women thats what gives you the focus the motivation the obsession and the third brain system is attachment that sense of calm and security you can feel with a longterm partner and this individual hes in the lust stage hes not ready to fall in love you know you have to be ready to fall in love to actually do it and hes just experiencing a different brain system the lust system this question is from gertig its a very interesting question any good data out there on divorce rates for couples that meet via online dating sites apparently if you met somebody online as opposed to offline youre less likely to divorce just by a little but you are less likely to divorce people who date online are more likely to be fully employed more likely to have higher education and more likely to be interested in a committed partnership this is from rakia rae how can you be in love with somebody and jealous of them easily when youre madly in love with somebody its called mate guarding other animals do it too and if you see your partner beginning to flirt with other individuals you could lose that partner you could lose your children you could lose your house you could lose your friends you could lose your money i mean you know the game of love matters this is from lamattina10 question of the day this person writes couples that do the this together have 20 more love hormones its not dirty well i dont know what this person has in mind but i would say play when you play with somebody youre driving up the dopamine system in the brain and that gives you focus motivation energy and optimism play with somebody stay with somebody oh thats it thats all the questions i enjoyed answering them thank you for joining me til next time

u53NWioihto,break your negative thinking  wake up positive motivational video,Motivation,i i truly believe that thoughts are the greatest vehicle to change power and success in the world everything begins with thoughts your words become your reality you are where you are today in part because of what youve been saying about yourself words are like seeds when you speak something out you give life to what youre saying if you continue to say it eventually that can become a reality whether you realize it or not you are prophesying your future this is great when were saying things like im blessed im strong i will accomplish my dreams im coming out of debt thats not just being positive you are prophesying victory prophesying success prophesying new levels your life will move in the direction of your words but too many people go around prophesying just the opposite i never get any good breaks ill never get back in shape business is slow ill probably get laid off flu season is here i always get it they dont realize they are prophesying defeat its just like theyre calling in bad breaks mediocrity lack you cant talk defeat and expect to have victory you cant talk lack not enough cant afford it never get ahead and expect to have abundance if you have a poor mouth youre going to have a poor life if you dont like what youre seeing start sewing some different seeds music so the first thing you have to do is you have to become conscious of your unconscious thoughts you have to notice your automatic habits and behaviors you have to become aware of your emotions that keep you anchored to the past and if you can become so conscious of the one unconscious states of mind and body that they would never slip by your conscious awareness again youre becoming familiar with the old self so you dont return then if you begin to think about new ways of being being defined by a vision plan your behaviors review them in your mind now if you keep doing that over and over again you begin to become familiar with the new state of mind at the same time if you can emotionally cultivate your inspiration your joy your enthusiasm ahead of the experience by repeating that over and over again cultivating that state its going to begin to become familiar to you so then the process of change then requires unlearning and relearning breaking the habit of the old self reinventing a new self unmemorizing emotions that are stored in the body then heres the key reconditioning the body to a new mind into a new emotion its literally moving from your past to your future its losing your mind and creating a new one and so then when you begin to understand that in the in that process its going to feel a little bit unfamiliar uncomfortable and if you can relax into that instead of going back to the past continuously invest in your future sooner or later itll begin to become easier and easier and easier and all of a sudden when you least expect it something amazing is going to happen in your life and when that event begins to occur youre going to pay attention to what you did inside of you now to produce the effect outside of you and thats called human empowerment and there isnt a person in the world thats excluded from this equation someones watching this and they have a thing that something they want to change um and its not its not sticking then maybe its not its the environment maybe you could check about your habits but maybe its your beliefs and your values some people will not get themselves to read every day because they dont value reading every single day right some people wont work lets say the behavior they want to change is you know we did a podcast on how to remember names i could teach them step by step on how to remember the name of most people that they meet yet they wont do it because they dont value it or because thats not important to them or they dont believe that they can right just like we talked about earlier saying your brain is like a super computer and you know your selftalk is a programmer runs if you tell yourself not go to memory names you will not remember the name the next person you meet because you program a super computer not to they dont have a belief that enables that so when i say all behavior is belief driven if you want to do this behavior whatever it is journal whatever it is then you need a belief that allows that to happen because you thats the program that allows that so how do you get that belief because youre going to feel like youre faking it right thats where most people stop right they they think okay i get it i hear what jim is saying that if i am able to shift my belief then i can get a different behavior but i dont believe it so now im just sort of faking it how do you help people overcome that right and so you i mean so some people approach it like they you know this quote where they fake it so they make it right um so my my thing with belief is like when i do trainings in groups or online my my favorite way of changing a belief is getting them to do something they never thought they could do because it opens up another possibility right so so for example in 1954 roger bannister he broke the form in a mile right and so which is amazing right throughout human history nobody can run a mile in less than four minutes now if you if you look into it how he was able to do it is he would visualize himself crossing the finish line looking at the clock and it says 359 because he knew that success is an inside out process that first it had to happen in here in order for happening out there right um dr wayne dyer has a famous phrase where its not oh ill believe it when i see it its like ill see it when i believe it because its the opposite right and so i i always like modeling the outliers where most people kind of just like kind of dismiss them i was like well whats going on there that allows this person to get this kind of result right and so with roger bannister he saw it in here be able to produce it outside just like any innovator or inventor or writer or any creator right but what was interesting is after that would happen nobody could do it from the beginning of humanity all of a sudden one person does it what happens after that everybody yeah everyone starts doing it and so thats the thing now what what happened was there a big change that year and you know training methodology and nutrition or no it was a change of belief right because the belief back then was if you ran a mile less than four minutes not only would you die it was your heart would explode in your chest and like think about like that would and im a runner right that would keep me not just running that wouldnt keep me from running forward that would keep me from running period right right and so my thing is like that was a change of a reference i was just shook up a belief so my goal with people when it comes to learning is get themselves to do something they never thought they could do and then it opens up another possibility it literally opens up their their nervous system for something what else could be possible when i grew up i you know we didnt have any we had no money right i had no education because that was a very learning challenge i didnt know any anybody right so i feel like its not when people are thats where theyll go though when they when they when theres a gap stop gap between where they are and where they want to be theyll say oh i dont have the money right on the education or on the intelligence out of the network or anything else like that and you know what you know as for all incredible success youve had and the value youve created for the world is that its not about resources right because we know a lot of people who who didnt have any resources that were able to impact the world its about our internal resources and what im saying is optimizing our environment optimizing our behaviors our capabilities our beliefs and our values and our identity right that at the highest level our identity because you cant just change your belief or your values or your behavior even if you dont believe youre that kind of person you know thats why i kind of always go to the superhero mythos because i want people that to claim that identity i call it the superhero you that version of ourselves that were not waiting for superman or batman or wonder woman its like you are wonder woman you are a batman you are superman its just we we have to commit ourselves to be able to unleashing just starting there and being able to reflect and observe the different voices inside of us is a great place to start your selfawareness because the biggest challenge is that most of us dont know what were listening to and we dont most of us dont even know that there are more than one voice inside of us just getting over that line is a huge win because now at least youre trying to differentiate in what youre hearing and thats going to help you make better decisions in the future music there are many ways to get the things that we want for ourselves in our lives but basically it all begins with how we choose to think as you think so shall you be seven little words that i think are perhaps the most important things that we can learn and master in our lives this old proverb notion that i become what i think about all day long and once you know that what you think about is what expands you start getting real careful about what you think about you dont allow your thoughts to be on anything that you dont want or that you wouldnt want to have manifest or show up for you in your life music let me tell you something how many of you have things when you want to go achieve them and this part of your voice goes oh its not going to happen or forget it im going to go to voice that sometimes interrupts that good pattern say i what you want to do is train a new one so starting when i was 17 i started doing incantations not affirmations affirmation you go im happy im happy im happy im happy im heavy whats the problem you havent changed your what youre what physiology if you dont change your physiology you wont get anything so an incantation is not only you speak it but you embody what youre saying with all the intensity you can and you do it with enough repetitions that it sticks in your head like its a small world now the conversation your head is always the same and it gives you what you want so use your body and your voice so 17 years ago i started doing things i was working for jim rohn this speaker and i was 17 years old i had long hair minestrone soup acne on my face i was trying to call on bear stearns type of people and convince them why they should go to this mans seminar be more successful i was driving a 1968 volkswagen that i had earned at 40 a week as a janitor the only way i did it was park far from the building and then go in and i love people i believe but i put myself in state and i was able to influence people that were far more successful than i was at the time i would do something that i still do backstage and have done for 23 years because i dont hope im going to be in a good state i demand it so i do an incantation using my whole body id say i now command my subconscious mind to direct me in helping as many peoples possible life today to better their lives by giving me the strength the emotion the persuasion the humor the brevity whatever it takes to show these people and get these people to change their lives now i would do that literally driving in my volkswagen to a meeting in la on the freeway for 40 minutes people are looking im screaming the top of my lungs theyre going i know hes a serial killer i know he is by the time i entered that room when two people meet if theres rapport the person whos most certain will always influence the other person and i was totally certain and they were trying to get revved up to certainty do you agree with this yes or no i do another one because i was poor i changed my mindset i kept doing things but i never got beyond it id say gods wealth is circulating in my life as well flows to me and avalanches of abundance all my needs desires and goals are met instantaneously by infinite intelligence where im one with god and god is everything and i would imagine the abundance in my life and i would feel so grateful and a year later i went for making 38 thousand dollars a year to make a million dollars a year in one year
LFQ3LkVF5sM,build a pc while you still can,Tech, this is not the future of the pc this is if the enthusiast in you screams that no you cant just replace gpus and cpus with integrated socs i am here to tell you that apple silicon go brrr apple obviously knows it and make no mistake intel amd and nvidia all know it too the writing is on the wall and now its just a matter of time pcs need to change and im gonna tell you how and why right after i tell you about our sponsor  glasswire glasswire lets you see past and present network activity detect malware on your pc or android device and block its connections to prevent things from getting worse use offer code linus for 25 off at the link below upbeat music  a lot of you really liked our how to build a pc the last guide youll ever need and im really glad that you do because it took so much effort to make but look at that run time and it could have been even longer think about how many components go into a typical pc build and then look at this unassuming little box the mac studio in our testing the m1 ultra variant pulled a grand total of 2234 watts from the wall under the heaviest load that we could give it and the m1 max version didnt even break three digits if we ignore the rosetta results they achieved 88 and 61 respectively of the core i9 12900k and the rtx 3090 benches overall performance in our productivity testing at just 34 and 15 of the total system power at most the 12900k the cpu alone can draw more power than the whole m1 ultra mac studio and developers are still figuring out how to optimize for apple silicon now look at that pc and all its components again all the raw materials that go into making it what it is its wasteful right in almost every way except economically its not that x86 is inherently bad but it has limitations that even intel have tried to overcome themselves with projects like itanium while extensions have given it more life its complex instruction set design is at its core an old one that dates back to the late 1970s literally every x86 base cpu boots up in 8086 compatibility mode and can in theory run software made for the og ibm pc precious dye space and transistors are used for supporting instructions and modes that might be redundant or not even remotely useful today but must be there to maintain compatibility with the architecture and now if im intel or amd looking at my options im sweating a little and weighing a switch to arm while neither currently sells an arm cpu both hold arm licenses and amd is on record saying that theyre willing and able to do it it wasnt that long ago even that intel had their own reduced instructions set cpu called the i860 and i960 and youd be kidding yourself if you thought that they werent prototyping stuff on the side like apple was when they were suffering through 14 nm  a change in the pc industry would of course have a teething period like apple silicon is currently experiencing but it could eventually be a good thing and not just for efficiency think about it intel and amd are alone in the cpu race right now just like amd and nvidia are currently alone in the gpu race and if intel had their way in the 90s or in 2015 thered be only one thanks to intels control over performance and efficiency enhancing extensions used on modern cpus like sse and avx and amds control over the 64 bit extensions that every desktop cpu since core two has used we dont have any other desktop cpu manufacturers anyone entering the x86 market would have to reverse engineer those extensions to compete because amd and intel have a technology sharing agreement that forbids sub licensing and expires if either company changes hands by contrast arm doesnt sell anything directly they develop the base specifications and then they license that to other companies who then have the option of tweaking and adding to those designs to tailor them to suit their needs this is how apple silicon came to be and if arm took off on the desktop we could see not only mobile players like qualcomm samsung and mediatek enter the ring but maybe google or even hp they used to make their own cpus once too and we cant forget nvidia whose last consumer arm soc uses gpu cores from 2014 and lives on in the nintendo switch and shield tv actually its kind of bizarre that nvidia hasnt continued to produce consumer socs like perhaps contractual obligations within and outside of nvidias control had something to do with it because not only were they close to straight up buying arm a sign that they knew times were changing but theyre also still actively developing arm socs just not for consumers their grace data center soc for ai acceleration has a surprisingly similar level of integration to apple silicon on paper and its just begging to be scaled down so that consumers can use it just like the teslas and not quadro gpus do with geforce but lets back up a sec duopoly aside if x86 is so bad and arm is so good why is x86 still the king of the pc well prior to apple silicon youd be forgiven for thinking that arm chips simply cant perform like intel and amd qualcomm has a virtual monopoly over non apple arm pcs and a literal monopoly in the windows ecosystem thanks to an exclusivity agreement with microsoft when that deal was pinned it probably did make some sense qualcomm was the third biggest chip maker even as of mid 2020 and theyre still a giant whos recently been eyeing a slice of the arm pie for themselves so assuming qualcomm would become the biggest supplier of desktop arm chips it made sense for microsoft to want to optimize for that hardware unfortunately for microsoft and for us theres no polite way to put this even qualcomms latest chips suck which recently prompted google to follow samsung and apple in going their own way with tensor and may eventually prompt microsoft to do the same qualcomms utter failure to compete in the pc space so far has given intel amd and especially nvidia precious breathing room and were not saying that the pc as we know it is dead today it definitely still has some life left and theyll first probably try to integrate x86 socs more tightly before they consider switching over intel for example could very well be working on an soc that combines alder lakes efficiency cores with a larger number of xe graphics cores and ai engine blocks taking the dye space that would otherwise have been allocated to the bigger performance cores even so reduced instruction set architectures proved their worth in the late 90s with early arm licensees and with powerpc which was famously used in the first imacs clock for clock powerpc tended to outperform x86 by a wide margin though this did depend on the task and eventually powerpc hit a performance and efficiency wall just like x86 is today intels itanium for its part was supposed to be a sort of successor to risk as a concept by using what hp termed explicitly parallel instruction computing or epic yes naming has always been bad unlike our swacket from lttstorecom it describes exactly what it is a sweater and a jacket as we know today itanium didnt work out so well still even intel saw that the x86s days were numbered their plan for pentium 4 was more or less to just clock it as high as it would go and hope that the numbers kept going up and now that were back to this phase again where we cant physically fit more cores on a dye because new process nodes are providing less additional density somethings got to give the current solution stacking dyes will only get you so far when youre already pushing 241 watts by comparison a lot of arms advantages today come not strictly from its reduced instruction set but from how its typically bundled into a system on chip configuration where virtually the entire computer is super close to the cpu cores why does this matter when we already have apus well its all about density and power draw simply expanding the size of the dye isnt normally a good idea from a power and thermal perspective but arm cores are typically much smaller than x86 and sip far less power so not only can you fit more of them into the same space youre also not as limited in terms of dye size in general m1 ultras dye area is bigger than the rtx 3090 ti lets do a case study amds 8 core ryzen 7 5700g desktop apus are somewhere between an m1 and m1 pro in terms of dye size the apu dedicates just over a quarter of the utilized dye space to cpu cores and cache alone and just 10 to the gpu for thermal management theres also a fair amount of unused white space even within the cores themselves meanwhile even m1s big performance cpu cores are tiny by comparison with all cores taking just over 20 of that smaller dye area the gpu takes up double the relative dye space as the apu which means theres way more gpu horsepower on tap and still room for other functions like the massive media engine neural engine and storage controller theres very little white space by comparison not only are those arm cores efficient enough to handle such a compact layout but when so much of the system is contained within it significantly less energy has to be used for signaling which also happens to be much faster if we tried to push an x86 processor to these densities in proximity with this many gpu cores it would quickly become a thermal meltdown event sort of like the opposite of how alex had to save a frozen core i912900ks literally frozen go check it out on floatplane along with more exclusive when youre done here and it scales m1 macs sports a larger dye than the rtx 3070 and m1 ultra is about a third again bigger than the rtx 3090 ti with the dye that large the computey bits to the 3090 ti would take up roughly half the m1 ultras dye area while apple will currently dedicates just over a third that means that if apple built a dedicated big chip design and werent using their own metal api separate from the rest of the industry they legitimately could reach high end gpu levels of real world performance shame that apple had to go their own way but imagine if nvidia were to build such a thing they could corner the arm desktop or notebook space very quickly if developers were on board especially its not as simple as gluing them together obviously and that geforce power consumption is still a problem but its also not an impossible hurdle and with the success of apple silicon despite its growing pains its impossible for the industry to ignore the advantages to this approach you can have excellent performance coupled with incredibly low power draw on a much more open architecture that allows for bigger or more aspirational system integrators to tweak things as they see fit this potential future will suck for enthusiasts who like getting their hands dirty but the alternative is laid bare before us power targets shooting up at record pace to the point where were looking at new connectors to help deliver all the juice this generation of hardware now is already incredibly power hungry with intel and amd squeezing higher and higher frequencies out of their cores and nvidia rumored to require up to 600 watts for their next gen top end gpu theres really no backing down we have to ask ourselves is it worth it and at what point does it stop being worth it at least its always worth listening to segways of

ZK7ZUJyMqYk,flat out in the 2023 v8 range rover sport,Sport,hi guys and welcome back to archie hamilton racing and to another video where today you join me where i am at goodwood but we are just about to drive the allnew range rover sport flat out today this is whats gonna happen the allnew range of sport is directly behind me im gonna walk you through the car and then what were gonna be doing is were gonna get a chance to drive it this might be a first because ive not seen any videos of the allnew range over sport going for it today were going to push it up the goodwood hill and were going to really enjoy it its going to be amazing carl which is longly anticipated and today like i say were going to get a chance to see the full true performance of it so lets get going so here we have the allnew range over sport everybody in this amazing color and like i say were gonna just have some fun with this today were gonna get a chance to push it enjoy it and everything else this car comes in some amazing color as you can see its like gray its kind of naruto gray but it is super super cool this one is fast its 530 rough brake horsepower its cool its a hundred and twenty thousand pounds and it does naught to sixty in four point three seconds called veriscene blue veracin blue is the actual color of this car so this is officially the v8 version uh which might be a little bit confusing but you can tell straight away because its got the four part the two pipes there and the two there equals four it must be going mad so thats very very cool and its actually called the p530 first edition i love the new look of this range rover sport it has so much presence and really really really does look the part i love all this section its just so so cool the v8 version for me i saw the dj version earlier but this is the one for me it really is a cool bit of kit and if we go here we can see that on the road 120 000 pounds pretty much is yours standard spec 112 but yeah its uh its a very very cool maximum power horsepower 530 maximum torque 750 so we are now inside the allnew range rover sport oh im so happy to be inside it it is so so cool the comfort levels i feel like im on my sofa this is more comfortable than my sofa let me show you what nice is all of this this car has done 300 miles so its not as high mileage car as you can imagine but look at all this amazing forged carbon its pretty much forged carbon which is nice meridian sound system we have 22 inch adjustable passenger massage seats so thats very cool as well very nice gentlemans taking me up today are we gonna fire it up yes lets go oh yes music oh yeah come on right were off what mode are we in are we in dynamic yep oh yeah dynamic mode is the mode to get the noise out the exhaust we have three different modes weve got a whole series of modes of the terrain response lets go to the the screens so good isnt it yeah great easy to reach swift response a lot of information about the angles its so good but it gives you everything all the modes eco ek mode comfort mode grass gravel snow mud ruts chaos sand rock crawl when are you crawling through rocks car will do it oh its so cool wade what is that i mean go through i think its a 900 millimeters of water nearly a meter of water no way a millimeter water yeah 900 mil oh all right so were going to quickly talk to you about the the key features of this car the active weve got suspension technology weve got first time weve ever had switching air springs which means they can go from comfort into really sporty engaging thats all done through terrain response so cool it adapts the car to how you want it to drive whether its in cold wintry weather or like today out on the circuit and how is it for well were going to find out for speed um its quick handles well absolutely fantastic yeah weve got active roll controls to help keep the vehicle flat weve got rear wheel steer so low speed unreal more agile high speed help stability so today flat out on the track you should feel that yes right were ready to go heres the sport i cant wait for this look at this it looks amazing doesnt it oh its just unreal if you havent seen look at these 23inch wheels as well these wheels are absolutely absurd these 20inch with 23inch wheels right we are just going up to the start line here in the range over sport are we ready what what are we in with dynamic dynamic mode helmets on were good helmets on were good im actually really looking forward to going like going fast in this because its just so much luxury or the other range over directly ahead of us so no dynamic debut of the car yeah in the uk yeah so this is the first sort of drive and its gonna does the steering go a bit heavier when you go into dynamics yeah the electronic steering adds a bit more weight bit more feel to it allows me to really feel whats going away that range over there oh im excited dynamic uh launch but now its quick enough isnt it wow absolutely up to the first corner park bend oh wow she had a bit of speed it handles nice mate like a nice wide line through cut a bit of grass yes that flat out all the way its quick straight under the bridge get me up to malcolm 100 miles an hour break nice and early brakes look at that nice straight through lovely v8 sound getting slightly tight there we go oh yes lovely stable feel with the rear wheel steer mate thats brilliant you know what that has amazed me in so many different ways like that the handling of that is amazing and think of the breadth of capability this car can do that offroad the rock core we talked about youre driving the sand yeah and yet here we are standard tires fantastic genuinely that is like really really amazed me like the fact of how the car drives is just amazing but the way the car turns in do you feel the rear will steer when you when you feel it you dont feel it well you get it weve got a very natural feel to the tune but you do feel the agility the car sort of shrinks around you feels lighter it feels agile but stable throughout that gives you the confidence to really drive it hard wow i think thats the right word to say really surprised me but i think it just took my breath away a little bit just how the car really turned in exactly theres something at the end of the day its a fantastic luxurious sports suv seats five in comfort and yet weve just been able to do a drive like that mate absolutely and how do you find it sort of if you were to put it on somewhere like a track it would handle nice wouldnt it yeah now we get a very nice balance as i say its about to be intuitive to drive yeah about actually making its bringing a smile to your face its not intimidating no its got agility but always comfortable and the brakes are powerful really powerful reassuring uh consistent pedal feel throughout and theyll stand up to some really good use perfect so youve got the comfort on the on the road and then as you can see from this uh lovely gentleman he knows how to drive and uh pushed it to its full potential as well so uh if youre thinking about one go and buy one i want one cant afford one at the moment but that was mega so down the hill climb can we go back to comfort yeah absolutely lets get your background just like that scenario on the dash and the dars change back a bit more information got more maps got everything else and the ride is completely different that is generally completely different isnt it when that when you do it like that so that is a well a first drive of the allnew range rover it has been absolutely epic and uh huge thank you to this gentleman who has uh been hooning it giving it the beans absolutely everything uh were actually just literally driving back down with the uh s pace svr and the range over just in front as well all the cars are heading back and shortly when we parked up we have just jumped out of the range over sport and that was an amazing amazing run and uh yeah huge thanks to that gentleman but weve had a really good run fun to uh to go in it see it and everything else but i hope you have enjoyed it a little insight to the allnew range over sport and a first drive pushing the

Tiy7i6uc960,ina gartens penne arrabiata  barefoot contessa  food network,Food,penne arabiata there are three things i love about this dish its elegant its earthy and you can make it ahead i mean whats not to love about that music im making penne arabiata rubiata sauce is really kind of a classic italian pasta sauce made with tomatoes mine has an unbelievable amount of garlic in it which im going to cook very slowly in olive oil its going to be really sweet and delicious so nobody wants to peel 24 cloves of garlic so what i do is i blanch them in a pot of boiling water just for about 15 seconds and then youll see the skins just slip right off just like that okay so thats a cup so ive got two thirds of a cup of olive oil that ive got warmed im gonna put the garlic in and just cook it for about 10 minutes just until the outside is like just barely browned and the insides really tender okay well let that cook for about 10 minutes okay next is the tomatoes so ive got two 28 ounce cans of san marzano tomatoes i think san marzano are the best quality canned tomatoes and ive got whole tomatoes im gonna put them in the food processor and just chop them up im just putting in the food processor so i can control the consistency of the tomatoes and im draining them because i dont want the sauce to be watery nobody wants watery sauce okay i can make bloody marys out of the rest okay get them in good and then im just gonna chop them up just like that you dont want to puree you just want them roughly chopped okay i think the garlic is just about ready and ill show you what i was looking for these are great i wish you could smell it nicely browned on the outside and perfectly cooked through okay im gonna take the garlic and put it right into the tomatoes and then im gonna chop that up and then cook it all together with some fennel this recipe actually is inspired by missy robbins who has the most incredible pasta restaurant in new york called missy its in brooklyn and she makes her a raviota sauce with 24 cloves of garlic and its so good and then im just going to chop that up so you get bits of garlic in the sauce and then this whole thing goes right back into the oil try and do it without getting it all over yourself so this is going back on the stove turn on the heat and im going to take two teaspoons of fennel seeds you can do it in a mortar and pestle but i think this is actually better to grind them yourself what i do is just chop them up and theyre going to bounce all over the place but its really worth it and i think what you do is you get a lot of the oils out of the fennel seeds just give it a rough chop like that theyre going to get tenderized when the sauce cooks i actually prefer using whole fennel seed rather than ground ground kind of loses its flavor when you chop up whole fennel seed you get all of those essential oils in it and fennel has this like anise flavor thats just great particularly with tomatoes okay right into the sauce right there one teaspoon of hot red pepper flakes okay next is a third of a cup of red wine im using an italian wine of course since its an italian dish im using a chianti you want something very dry and kind of rough twothirds of a cup just pour it right in yum tablespoon salt make sure its really well seasoned teaspoon of pepper im always looking for how flavors complement each other how the tomatoes make the red wine taste better how the red wine makes the fennel taste better this is going to do exactly that the garlic flavor is everything so im just going to bring it to a boil and then lower the heat and let it simmer for 30 minutes im almost done with the arabiata sauce im just going to add some fresh basil to it gives it a nice fresh kind of peppery flavor okay about a quarter of a cup right into the sauce so ive got a big pot of boiling water salt and one pound of penne and im cooking it to about two minutes less than it requires for al dente and thats because im gonna cook it in the sauce so lets see how its doing okay great its perfect with a wire strainer just put it right into the pasta sauce and that way all of the pasta sauce gets absorbed into the pasta and it really flavors it very often what we do is we serve pasta and then we put the sauce on top and it just kind of sits on the top but this way it cooks into it and a little bit of the starch from the pasta really thickens the sauce so the two elements really work together so thats all the pasta just give it a big stir im just going to cook this all together oh man overboard its going to cook together for two minutes the pasta will be perfectly cooked and the sauce will be just really silken and delicious i can really smell the garlic but its like soft not sharp in the meantime while that cooks im going to julienne a little more basil for garnish i love pastas because you can make the sauce in advance just cook the pasta cook it together and youve got a fabulous dinner big salad im a happy camper okay so clear the decks need a big bowl and the pasta should be done this looks gorgeous and you can really tell that the tomato sauce has gotten into the pasta who wouldnt want to have this for dinner a little fresh basil on top and lots of freshly grated parmesan actually i call it grated parmesan but its really ground i grind it in a food processor just because i like that kind of grainy texture of it a fork this is the kind of dinner anybody in the family would love its just not your ordinary tomato sauce this is pasta arabiata with 24 cloves of garlic it smells amazing mmm and it tastes so good music this recipe and more can be found at bearcontessacom you
2xVBAqybA_8,chemist answers chemistry questions from twitter  tech support  wired,Tech, my name is dr kate biberdorf but you may know me as kate the chemist today ill be answering your questions from twitter this is chemistry support upbeat drum music psyrihad wants to know isnt the whole universe a chemical reaction yes absolutely 100 yes chemistry is everywhere in everything if you can see it breathe it touch it its chemistry were taking atoms and rearranging them into different ways and its just chemistry everywhere everything everything around us its elemental next up from enonyame wants to know chemistry lecturer why does diet coke and mentos make a chemical reaction mentos is a porous candy and so if you look really closely at a mentos mento mentos all of it on the outside has these little holes theres these little pores and when we drop it into diet coke that is immediately attractive to carbon dioxide so all the carbon dioxide in the soda rushes to the candy and it starts to sit on those pores but its not just one carbon dioxide molecule or a second carbon dioxide molecule its hundreds and thousands of them slamming together at once so as they reach the candy theyre smashing into each other here they build up pressure and they end up shooting straight out of the diet coke and so we have this really beautiful soda volcano it has nothing to do with the diet coke itself its the fact that theres carbon dioxide in the soda and its the shape of the candy itself so you could do this experiment with coke with mountain dew with any soda you want it just so happens that diet cokes works really well and it doesnt contain the sugar so its much easier to clean up now hollyjean05 wants to know in chemistry how do you get two bonds to break up this feels like a joke laughs i will say you can get two bonds to break whenever you have neighboring atoms that they are more attracted to so let me give you an example i dont know if youve ever heard of this but blake lively and ryan reynolds when they were first together they were set up on blind dates with other people and so you have blake and another man with ryan and another woman and so theyre sitting across the table from each other not interested in their original pairing very interested in each other and so this is referred to as a double replacement reaction where you start off partnered with somebody else but then you see something thats better a better option i mean its ryan reynolds how can you you know and so then you form another bond and so now blake and ryan are now paired and then these other two are not but in theory they could be partnered up if they wanted to so its as simple as that your atoms are more attracted to something else kickthepj wants to know just found out that my brain has chemicals inside it wtf that doesnt sound good how do i get them out of there oh no laughs pj you want chemicals in your brain you need them otherwise youre not gonna be able to function at all for example adenosine is in your brain and that helps you get sleepy or drowsy so it encourages your body to go to sleep you absolutely need these molecules in your brain without them you would not be a functioning human courtkneerose wants to know if atoms are primarily composed of empty space why cant you pass your hand through a solid object so lets go to the basics here and atom is formed with a nucleus in the center and in the center you have protons and neutrons so if my body was an atom my kidneys my liver those would be my protons and neutrons like inside my core now on the outside of your atom thats where your electrons are moving around so that would be like my gloves or you know my sunglasses or a hat something thats on the outside so atoms can really easily exchange electrons to a neighboring atom i can give you my gloves i can give you my scarf i cant really give you my kidney or my liver thats gonna be really difficult so we can exchange electrons but not so much protons and neutrons now the question here is why cant you pass your hand through a solid object and the reason being is cause that nucleus is extraordinarily dense its very very dense its got those neutrons those protons and it takes up a lot of space and so yes you can pass your hand through the spot that has all the electrons but as soon as you slam into that nucleus thats a dense object that you cannot pass through now we have carlee0575 wants to know how do pheromones work pheromones are so cool so what happens is one animal lets say you have an ant is going to release some pheromones then a neighboring ant is going to absorb those pheromones into their body and all of a sudden have all these new signals some information so ants tell each other where food is other animals could possibly give out sex pheromones so its kind of like a way to play cupid and you can encourage someone else to be attracted to you just by giving those off unfortunately humans dont have sex pheromones because we learned how to communicate so if we just wink and give a little high five usually that can send the message across we dont need to shove our hormones into someone else to make them attracted to us iqair wants to know whats in a firework its a combination of potassium nitrate some carbon and some sulfur so essentially what happens is the potassium nitrate decomposes releasing oxygen gas when oxygen is in the presence of charcoal or carbon its gonna burn and the sulfur helps to create a lot of smoke now theres usually a second piece in there like a delayed timer thats going on as well and so once that gets hot enough thats gonna do the second boom so the first explosion gets us all the way up to the sky and the second explosion gives us the huge bang now this is where we see the colors so if theres red theres gonna be some strontium in there if theres some green or blue theres probably copper the pinks are from potassium those burnt orange beautiful colors those are from sodium so its a big mixture of molecules and its all thanks to chemistry okay next one saintgregory wants to know does anybody even know what electrolytes actually are or do i know electrolytes are charged minerals so theyre cations and anions in the human body so often we see things like sodium calcium magnesium maybe some chlorine and they all make sure that your body functions properly so theyre in charge of sending nerve signals through your body theyre in charge of making sure your heart beats some of them make sure that you have enough fluid inside the cells while another one makes sure that you have enough fluid outside of the cells the chlorine is even used to help digest things in your stomach so its all over your body and you need these electrolytes and thats why if youre drinking alcohol you usually feel awful the next day because youve pushed all these electrolytes out of your body and now your bodys a little bit wonky all right from sciamerica whats the chemistry behind home pregnancy tests oh this is a great question home pregnancy tests work very similarly to our rapid covid test so you have a piece of paper and you have an antibody thats essentially sewn into the paper so when a woman becomes pregnant about 10 days after conception we have this hormone called hcg and what happens is you can urinate that out onto your test and if that hormone is present in the urine it will bind to the antibody in the test and it will activate a dye molecule and so thats where youll see that blue plus sign or the blue word pregnant or anything like that fun fact a long time ago in ancient egypt they used to use home pregnancy tests by having women urinate on barley seeds and wheat seeds and if they sprouted really quickly that hormone must be present in the woman because thats what activated those seeds and make them sprout really quickly so they could actually detect pregnancy with about 70 to 85 accuracy up next afstanton asks what is the most dangerous chemical reaction okay so you have to be careful because this question would absolutely start a fight with a gigantic group of nerds its like asking you which is the best superhero in general i would say anything with lots of nitrogens so if we have lots of nitrogens that usually means explosion so theres things called azides theres one called azidoazide azide so c2n14 and that one kind of has the internets reputation of being the most explosive its not really but its very unstable and thats why it gets this reputation one thing could be it would explode if you stir it it would explode if you heat it up it can also explode when youre not even in the room i will never forget when my professor was talking about these explosive materials and he said in his lab a friend of his picked up a beaker and just not thinking about it picked up his safety glasses to wipe his brow and right as the safety glasses went up pew the thing just exploded the guy no longer can see and i have vividly remembered that and i am unbelievably anal about my goggles now bittermodeon asks who created the periodic table it depends who youre asking the very first version of the periodic table was a man who brought three elements together and just put them together based on explosiveness the second guy came through and took these little sets of three and made triads and made little ts with them and so little xs but at that point we had to memorize all these ts and it was really complicated so two men at the exact same time but separately individually so dmitri mendeleev and the lothar meyer came together and they organized all of our elements based on increasing atomic mass but heres why dmitri mendeleev always gets the credit he noticed a pattern so lets say we had a pattern like 2 4 8 10 theres that missing number six so we would see that it would go okay 2 4 6 8 10 and mendeleev did the exact same thing he was like there are two elements that we are definitely missing he saw the pattern and left holes for that in the periodic table so 10 years later when gallium and germanium were discovered mendeleev was given all the credit for the periodic table because not only did he order it in increasing atomic mass but he also predicted these unknown elements pretty cool right next up from saintmarytulsa why does popcorn pop how does a lava lamp work and how do you make slime popcorn kernels have a little piece of water in there so a couple water molecules in the liquid state now when we heat them up the liquid water converts to gaseous water so it vaporizes but the gas takes up space and it moves around so its slamming against the side of the kernel and eventually when it has a high enough velocity or enough kinetic energy it actually pushes that kernel to pop and now you made popcorn for a lava lamp equally cool what we have is some kind of container that has usually oil on top and then liquid at bottom and then what you need to do is somehow generate some gas a simple way of doing this would be to add like an alkaseltzer tablet which would generate carbon dioxide and so the gas forms at the bottom of the lava lamp and it starts to pull up as it goes up it kind of drags the water molecules with it and they go all the way up to the top so visually we see the water molecules move through the oil layer they get to the top the gas pops it lets go of the water molecule waters more dense than oil so it sinks down to the bottom and then the process just repeats itself carbon dioxide goes up it pops water comes back down over and over again very beautiful last one how do you make slime fantastic question let me show you youll need about one cup of glue three cups of shaving cream so now were gonna stir stir stir after that were gonna add one teaspoon of baking soda again stir stir stir so if youre adding glitter or food coloring now go to town so were looking for a nice homogenous mixture so its all really mixed together two tablespoons of contact solution is going to activate your slime because were adding boron let this sit for like i dont know 30 minutes or so and let that reaction happen but if you cant wait like me i cant ever wait stick your hands right in there ooh next up from cwpslv so how exactly does chlorine work to disinfect your pool water so what we usually use is a hypochlorite hypochlorous acid buffer it is a buffer or a solution that locks the ph into 752 so what happens is if you add something thats slightly acidic the basic component of the buffer reaches out and eats that neutralizes it keeps the pool clean if you add something thats slightly basic the acidic part of the buffer will reach out and eat that and keep the pool nice and clean next jackofspeed what is the difference between evaporation and boiling chemistryquestion are you one of my students cause this is an exam question i use every year so evaporation and boiling are similar but theyre different so boiling happens at a very specific temperature so here on earth at atmospheric pressure water is going to boil at a hundred degrees celsius or 212 degrees fahrenheit but that is always going to happen at that specific temperature evaporation can happen anytime and so what happens is you have all these water molecules lets just assume you have a glass of water you have all these water molecules and they are moving at a distribution of velocities so the ones that have really high velocities really high kinetic energy they have enough movement enough wiggle around to actually break those hydrogen bonds break those intermolecular forces and move from the liquid state to the gas state but that can happen at any temperature it does not need to be a hundred degrees celsius for your glass of water to evaporate on your nightstand next up noseknowsnose how does tomato juice make skunk smell go away it doesnt thats an old wives tale so what happens is you actually have whats referred to as olfactory fatigue and so your brain just kind of stops smelling the skunk smell and youre only smelling the tomato smell so its basically nose blindness thats all next up jeetesh21 how do fireflies glow fireflies have this molecule in their abdomen called luciferin and what happens is theyre able to essentially bring oxygen into their bodies through all these little holes and tubular pathways in their bodies and once the oxygen hits that molecule it reacts with a bioluminescent enzyme that makes this thing glow its very beautiful all right thats it ive gone through all the questions i hope youve learned something until next time upbeat music
cpWC67MVn0Y,i went undercover in typical gamers fashion show,Fashion,okay guys weve got 50 people in this fashion show in my fashion show and among them one of them is lachlan yeah spoiler alert im

nice blue heart okay oh someones asking to die so something red get thrown in the air there a little 100 on the back of respect to oh genius okay oh drippy when you walk oh yo fish yo fish hit a move hit a move five seconds five hes doing three sixties three two well i dont know bro i think somethings wrong with the fish i i feel like i cant kill him he does he not have any emotes there we go oh he hit that wait is there anything in there oh i just dont like this alien bro i just yeah i can see him from here he not that drip im sorry bro turn around i got to do with honor oh hes crying oh i had to kill him so i didnt hear the cry i just couldnt i couldnt handle it you know everyone run to me real quick last one here loses last one here loses last one year loses tyler blevskys oh no last one back to a black pillar loses last one back last one back jeez actually i couldnt tell i couldnt sound good okay so are you alive still im still alive okay okay the next one is going to be a tough one i feel like a lot of you guys are going to get eliminated here it has to be an og skin oh g skin okay oh g skin oh g vibes oh you know i gotta pass that assignment lets go all right look were gonna try it i i think if i do john wick with the the wings you dont have an og skin youre crying huh why dont you give it a shot just get in there come on second this guy comes out of the booth hes gonna blast a brown car what hes gone bro i know he already admitted he admitted youre not supposed to talk to the police you know all right its oh gee skins and what do we got here oh you dont got an og skin look at me come on look at it you aint got one youre writing me a love note i dont even want to see it dont turn it around hey hey bro why why you hiding behind the booth vision pickaxe i like that all right i do respect that there wasnt backlinks in the day but i said i want the backlinks to make me feel something oh gee emo you got five seconds one oh honestly hit me with the tpost oh its tired gee a little bit maybe with another one you got five seconds five i got a bunch of crybabies over here two one thats a hug thats up thats thats gone thats out of here oh cry baby cry baby dead

going to come back to you ill come back to you its not off the hook yet gee no that backbones from uh chapter two buddy the backbone is from chapter two yeah why dont you go take a go take a go take a run towards the center map if you make it there in three seconds i wont kill you go three two one not fast enough bro not fast enough bro sorry look at the sword yeah oh its not ojiba its true okay look you got 30 seconds to pull out the og default dance go 30 seconds oh my gosh i was gonna take out a timer and everything oh i know you fast for sure i was that was light that was light hey yo whats that cape though im gonna let you fly ill let you fly right john wick with the pencil number two pencil nice wings on this dudes losing it back here hes loose oh my base is just going off the hook another john wick with reaper and red that brought back hey hey hey hey hey hey bust down bust out and break those knees break those things i like that okay oh you guys are hitting me in the feels of these ah it smells like four night oh omega throwback hey its only dancing know how to do it in real life hey yo hey purple omega oh okay okay oh gee this guy hit me in the fields ill feel it this is actually dripping im not gonna lie the heck is this what if i see an interview theres a lot of movement theres a lot of movement okay all right i hit him for 69 i think i let him live youre lucky any other number you would have been dead youre way too ugly what was the captain americas shield for what the frick were you thinking dog i dont remember is there another rust lord i think there is right could all these rust lord skins come to the middle please every single one of them all right lachlan pick a number from one to three three two oh imagine if i mentioned if i was in there and i just said myself imagine imagine all right im just picking another number yeah yeah two two is safe one is then okay all the john wicks all the john wicks come to the center usually they say safety in numbers but not here okay everyone stop eating um were gonna play a little game with simon says okay you guys ready yep simon says crouch stand dance right now dance right now you know you killed me right wait i killed you when we were just there i was the john wick he was just like stan i was like oh why not standing off i just want to say that im proud of you all for making it this far all right lachlan had a buyin because thats his map and he has one more life this is it no mercy now okay the next theme is going to be build your own superhero but you cant use the build a superhero skin and it has to be like its own personality but it cant be someone already established cant be spiderman cant be superman wow thats kind of hard okay okay you got two more minutes i know this ones tough so im gonna give you a little more time yeah look this is one of those ones where like its either gonna work or not gonna work here we go the next round is happening now hes calling the horn thats actually sick hero over here superhero you cant be an established superhero thats pretty fun i like that i like that okay oh hey boston moves too move oh my gosh you are the ugliest superhero ive ever seen oh no no you dont think so okay do an emote or something slug boy i can appreciate i can appreciate that this isnt you is it lachlan no like whether you answered yes or no he was getting blasted just so you know oh hey hold up that guy is drippy drippy drippy oh whats going on here oh that is sick that is sick oh hes got all the emotes with it my man only had like two music she technically an established superhero i mean shes from that shirt right shes from the show shes from the walking dead i feel like its established already so its kind of going against what i said all right youre good youre good youre good what is this alien boy over here oh yeah everyone in this fashion show has the power stuff okay lets go i didnt say yes oh i didnt say yes come on bob you gotta you gotta do something there whats your name yeah this is a cute man he looks kind of sick oh whats he doing what oh he bro what do you put there i dont it doesnt go with anything its just its just goo these things look kind of sick this thing like yeah that that what is it its the its the mermaid one right its so ugly i respect it so much just go with your little paddle feet hey you can go yeah youre good i think some people think im gonna say simon says and theyre like traumatized like im just joining the gang like hey guys hey guys we all made it to the next round lets go guys lets go lets go guys lika how confident you feeling about your like drip i think that is ive worn that in a video before this one right here yeah its safe to say this isnt you right i mean could be

_2jULayKYTs,game theory the forgotten war of minecraft minecraft 119 update,Game,portion of this video is sponsored by squarespace the wither the second boss of minecraft a haunting floating nightmare thats eluded all explanations since its introduction back in 2017 the ancient builders a civilization lost to history their works brought to ruin and their name eroded by time the warden the newest threat to this world a creature of blind rage engulfed in shadow an unstoppable force fueled by souls and empowered by darkness three groups three distinct mysteries waiting to be solved and all of them united by this hello internet welcome to game theory the show that cant wait to hear you click that subscribe button is it safe are we okay so sorry about that i kind of forgot the warden was a thing but can you blame me the warden was due to come out in the summer of 2021 but then the deep dark ended up getting removed from the update which itself got split into two parts speaking of two parts no dont worry this episode isnt a twoparter but we do have ourselves a second minecraft video happening today over on food theory thats right we got ourselves a minecraft weekend yall well here were busy dissecting the latest editions from the wild update over on food theory were talking all about the dream smp which honestly doesnt sound very foodie but then dream decided to go and kill tommy in it using a potato and you know where there is murder to be had well probably find a way to make a theory out of it so head on over there for all your potato murder needs after youre done with this video because first we gotta finish talking about the warden as of this week it has finally launched as part of the wild update according to mojang not only have the mechanics of the warden been refined but theyve added new blocks to the deep dark new items and oh yeah were also getting one of the coolest most complex and interesting structures ever created in minecraft the ancient cities based on the name alone this seems like the thing that weve been theorizing about for years oh victory has never felt so good but you know what feels even better than being right have a new lore to chew on mojang understands that you dont just drop an entire underground city complete with giant burning portal frame into your game without considering what its doing there from a story perspective and similarly you dont just introduce the single strongest mob to guard it without factoring in the rationale for placing it there so our question is why what does all of this mean for the secret story of minecraft how do these disparate parts wind up working together well shockingly not only is everything here connected but all of it is also tied to one of the longest standing mysteries in the game the wither but to decode it all we actually need one key item an item thats been broken up and hidden throughout all of these updates something innocuous something unsuspecting a simple music disc everything is unlocked through this one disc so what is the story of the deep dark and how does it tie into the narrative that weve been building over the last three years strap in friends cause today were diving in deep to tap into the darkest lore of minecraft first lets talk about the skulk when the skulk family of blocks was originally announced in 2020 we understood the basics a skull sensor reacts to noise and when it does it alerts a fearsome monster known as the warden to your exact location two hits later youre dead son but now we have more details and what weve learned is disturbing to say the least a new block called the skulk catalyst basically takes in energy to transform the blocks around it into other skulk blocks thats how this creature is able to spread but it begs the question what energy is it using to convert these regular blocks well this aint your grandmas moss blocks that you can just bone meal around my friends these things take something a bit more potent than that the souls of the living you see if a mob dies within eight blocks of the catalyst the mob wont drop xp orbs instead souls appear above the catalyst at which point the skulk spreads to new blocks remind me where have we seen souls in relation to this update before oh yeah the warden in the middle of its chest we have what looked to be the faces of three trapped souls now in our last theory we speculated that wardens were created using a combination of skulk and souls in order to protect the underground cities however im not so sure anymore back in 2020 we got this tweet from 119 developer brandon pierce which says quote you could definitely argue that the skulk in general is sentient now we just talk about how when a mob dies near the skull catalyst it creates new skulk blocks but it can also create a new block called the skulk shrieker this block is the key because not only does it have souls swirling around inside of it thereby confirming that its being created from the souls of the dead but it also makes these sounds thats fine i didnt need to sleep tonight minecraft is totally a kids game anyway that shriek isnt just signaling that i have to take an adult diaper change when it goes off youll hear another noise the sound of something burrowing up to the surface that something is the warden so what am i saying here well im suggesting that the warden wasnt created by the ancient builders to protect themselves instead i think it was made by the skulk to protect itself when it senses danger it summons a creature made of skull an unstoppable force that acts as the final line of defense trying to ensure the survival of this species and this is actually supported by the warden item drops you see if you manage to take one down it drops a single skulk catalyst which honestly feels like a crummy reward for something so difficult however from a lore standpoint it makes perfect sense if the whartons primary objective is indeed the survival of the species then in defeat it would want to release a lastditch attempt to keep the species alive hence a single catalyst but that still doesnt answer the major question where did the skulk come from in the first place for that we actually have to take a closer look at the new biome the deep dark and more importantly those ancient cities once you enter the deep dark biome you start to find these patches of skulk blocks if you follow these patches further down into the cave eventually youll find an ancient city ruins covered in even more skull logic would dictate that since the concentration of skulk is higher in the cities this must be where it originated and this seems to be correct in ancient cities the hallways are covered in wool and carpets thats an important detail since the skulk and wardens are sound based entities they respond to your steps and wouldnt you know wool and carpet are the only blocks that dont activate the skulk when theyre walked on this tells us that the inhabitants of the ancient city were clearly aware of the warden and they were trying to live their best alongside it however just because this seems to be where the warden lives now doesnt mean that its always been here right in the middle of the ancient cities is a massive structure made out of a new block called reinforced deep slate and a movable indestructible block similar to the end portal frames but thats not where the similarities end in the game files this big structure of reinforced deep slate is known as the city center its a pretty generic name right doesnt really tell us all that much however there are smaller versions of that same city center dotted around and in the game files theyre known as small portal statues portal you say now sure mojang has said for years that it isnt adding any new dimensions but thats missing the point i dont think mojang is introducing a new dimension i think theyre introducing the idea of a new dimension as they continue to explain minecrafts history a history that becomes a lot more clear thanks to one little item or should i say nine little items that make up a bigger one disc number five thats right ladies and gentlemen weve got ourselves a new numbered disc and you know what that means soundbased storytelling but before i can start piecing together the disc and the lore ive got to tell you about how you can start piecing

i alluded to disc five is actually split into nine fragments which can be found in chests throughout the ancient city but instead of delightful music this one follows in the footsteps of discs 11 and 13 a sound effect driven track thats designed to tell us a story in order to fill out the lore of whats going on here the track starts off with the classic sound of static like youd expect from an old record player but it begins to ramp up into a loud rumble which is then immediately cut off followed by what appears to be the speed up of time well hear these sorts of speed ramp effects a lot throughout the disc the next set of sounds are ones that are familiar to anyone who knows discs 11 and 13 the sound of someone walking underground this time on drip stone you can tell based on the footsteps using their flint and steel to light a fire while bats flutter through the cave music however as this character walks it eventually turns into a march which is then joined by other footsteps coming from what seems like heavily armored soldiers we can make out sirens going off in the background it all comes to an abrupt halt when something that sounds like a lever gets pulled now i look through a lot of minecraft sounds but there are a number of sounds in this track that i couldnt find exact matches for sounds like theyve added extra sound effects to help build out the story like in this case the sound of a lever is more like a switch being flicked but in the track it feels much bigger like a lever thats attached to a large mechanism cause following that sound we hear some creaking and the sound of wind rushing in like a huge door thats being opened after this we hear our character take a deep breath only to then hear a monster shriek so far it feels relatively selfexplanatory the first person we hear walking is someone leading a charge or a group of soldiers lighting a torch to help them walk underground in the distance we hear the warning sirens of a city blaring they open the door in order to defend the city against something when suddenly the disc has a weird break we hear 23 seconds of just music its almost like different discs have been smashed together it wasnt fragments after all that would also probably explain all the time warping effects we hear throughout the track different chunks of the disc were recorded at different rpms which is why the audio is constantly warping and shifting anyway when the music ends were back to the story bubbling lava can be heard while more footsteps on drip stone move towards an amethyst they break the block and doing so seems to set off some sort of a cavein its not really a sound i recognize and the closest i could find were mood sounds from the nether wastelands which would explain the lava but not really the drip stone floor of the amethyst after the cavein we hear screeches off in the distance screeches of what appear to be phantoms doesnt make a whole lot of sense underground however very shortly afterwards we hear our character run quickly and the terrain changes from drip stone to stone to dirt music meaning that hes running relatively close to the surface we are the clanging of tools as they collect materials coughing as they light fires to sea but he clearly sees something that causes him to run away quickly only to then reveal another monster roar which is again quickly distorted by the change of scene from the disc thuds are now heard in the background explosions distorted by the cave system our character places down sand scrapes a metal tool against a stony object and finally a mechanical noise is heard all while eerie voices whisper in the background similar to that of the soul sand valleys but the explosions are getting more frequent until eventually one bursts into the area theres a brief moment of silence before suddenly the reverse sound of glass is heard and we hear the souls shriek in a huge gust leaving nothing but a warping hum in the background all of which sounds very similar to the creation of a portal in that moment our character takes a few steps towards the portal we know this because the sound gets louder until he places down dirt blocks to help him reach it where we are then met with the sound of a skulk sensor and the roar of a warden tape actually winds down here but theres actually one more sound mixed in with the warden roar listen carefully did you catch it the warden roars and its closely followed by a slowed down death sound from one very specific mob the wither so thats the breakdown of the disc from what i can hear but thinking about the story fragments that we have the question is what does it mean well lets actually talk about that last bit a member of an ancient builder society the same one that made these underground cities is out caving collecting precious materials when all of a sudden he hears something out in the distance he rushes to the surface only to see the wither floating there this leads to the first section of the disc with the emergency sirens blaring the wither is on its way so the city needs to mobilize its army to try and take it down they travel through the caves until they get to a secure entrance when they open the gates its clear that their worst fears have come true the wither has followed the colonists down into the depths they can hear the withers explosions in the distance getting closer and more frequent desperate for an escape they rushed to finish the new portal technology theyve been working on theyve clearly built portals before specifically to the nether where theyve learned about the properties of soul sand we know this because of the lanterns that are all around the ancient city they begin to make the final touches to their portal they make it out of a block that is so impenetrable not even the wither can destroy it this is gonna be their ticket out they place soul sand underneath this new portal and they light it which is exactly what we see left over in the ancient cities there are also still remnants of their experiments underneath the portal redstone circuits experimenting with powering blocks how much power you can output with different objects redirecting power ultimately soul sand seems to be the most powerful source of energy combining all of these things together allows them to open the portal the souls from the soul sand screaming as theyre used to power it at that moment the wither breaks through the builder makes his way to the portal to escape but its not what they expect from the portal comes the warden who destroys the wither but also brings the skulk into this world and so that is the story of disc 5 the origins of the warden its not an experiment gone wrong its a desperate escape attempt to the wrong place which brings with it a new and deadly invasive species the skulk but the thing is disc five isnt the end of our story because how did the ancient builders go from here all the way to the end well it may be slightly more speculative but hear me out the warden comes through the portal and kills the wither this wasnt the ancient builders intent but hate worked out for him regardless and so they worship the warden as some kind of god this is why there are candles all around the portal along with the portal being shaped to look like the warden however this blissful ignorance doesnt last forever the ancient builders carry on with their lives but doing so activates the new skulk thats around which eventually resummons the warden the warden then goes on to kill many ancient builders spreading the skull further those that do manage to survive try what they can to remain in the city that theyve built they put down carpets and wool to make sure that they dont make sounds while walking around but its not enough even opening their chests sets the skulk off so theyre forced to leave the city the few that remain decide rather than building vast cities to instead build one fortified fortress the stronghold built with confusing hallways and winding staircases in order to give them the ability to outrun the warden should the skulk make its way to them in these strongholds they create the end portals and use them to escape from this unforgiving world only to then get stuck on the other side so there you have it the origin of one of minecrafts newest and most dangerous mobs the warden isnt a failed experiment but rather an invasive species that came from another world and while many are begging for a new dimension to be added to the game disc 5 serves as a warning of what happens when you open portals to mysterious new lands if the warden is what popped out last time i fear what lies in wait should we open it again but hey thats just a theory a game theory thanks for watching music you

VyasSLF63T0,playing 1020 at wynn  poker vlog 124,Vlog,music okay guys welcome to another episode from vegas here im not a resorts world today and im not at the world series of poker but instead at another one of my favorite properties on the strip music thats right this is the wind slash encore property home to probably one of the most popular poker rooms in all of las vegas if not the world and its for good reason they have really good staff the games are good uh the propertys super nice so i figured why not spend the day here today and play some 510 the game is uncapped which is definitely a plus so im going to be in for some amount in the neighborhood of 10 or 20 000 and as per usual were going to see how it goes now this is probably the last video to come out before this event which is the meetup game on club gg june 30th its gonna be a one two no limit game so if any of you guys are interested in playing virtually alongside me this is the time and place to do it and the following day july 1st theres going to be a 2 000 free roll tournament also on club gg and the only way to qualify for that tournament is to play the meetup game the previous day so like i said if any of that sounds appealing to you hit the link in the description to sign up its pretty straightforward but anyways until then lets jump into the poker hands music all right guys here we are underway at the wind and we get some good news right off the bat as the whole table decides to play 5 10 20 instead of just 510 so already off to a good start and not only that but we all agree to start off the night with a 500 plo flip meaning we each put in 500 get dealt four cards just like plo and off we go to a flop to see who has the winning hand at the end now clueless as i am to this game i announced my set of eights which turns out to be good and then eventually realize i have a straight with queen jack not that it makes any difference since i end up winning this flip anyway but yeah just a testament to how little i know whats really going on in most omaha hands either way off to a great start as were up around 25 or 3 000 something like that less than five minutes after sitting down but anyway enough of the crazy shenanigans we move on to a normal hand here where theres a button open to 70 the big blind calls and im in the straddle with king queen typically i think calling makes a little more sense but this time i decide to play aggressively also considering that theres some dead money from the big blind calling and play my hand in the more adventurous fashion by raising it up to 350 dollars the button makes the call hes the initial razor but the big blind folds so heads up out of position to a flop of ace king eight with two hearts so ive got middle pair mixed feelings about this one but i think just betting small with all my hands makes the most sense so thats what i do and he makes the call it turns the eight of clubs pairing the bottom card this time i check it and he checks it back the river is the four of diamonds i check it again hoping to get to showdown but this time my opponent disagrees and bets 730 dollars given how the hands played out i think hes most likely just got an ace thats going for value not sure how much i agree with that play but as it stands i think my hand is not necessarily strong enough to call and win really too often so instead i decide to use this board and my hand as a check raised bluff by making it thousand three hundred dollars not sure looking back how much i like this play um especially having the queen of hearts it makes it less likely hes got a hand like a queen high flush draw thats bluffing for example but as played thats what i did and unfortunately my opponent ends up calling with ace nine of clubs so yeah a little bit of an interesting hand here but like i said i dont really love the way i played it and the result definitely reflects that as we lose a pretty big pot to start the night lets see if we can turn things around with eight seven of spades in this next one theres a middle position open to 60 good mix here between calling or raising this time i just call and the button calls as well so three of us going to a flop of 10 10 8 initial razor checks i decide to bet 50 dollars though i think checking is fine too the button calls and the initial razor calls as well so still three of us going to return which is the ace of diamonds not really a great card for me so this time i check and the button checks back and we go to a river which is the nine of spades initial razor checks again i check it as well but now the button throws out 400 dollars initial razer folds and now its back on me this is definitely an interesting situation because if he had a 10 i would imagine he would bet the turn almost always and if he doesnt have a 10 why exactly is he betting so big doesnt he want to get called if hes got something good so i dont know i was a little bit curious it felt like he could easily be trying to steal the pot with some sort of miss draw whats kind of weird is a lot of his draws would improve to at least one pair when the nine hits on the river but as per usual when im curious about whats going on and i think a decision is close i tossed in the money and this time thats the incorrect decision as we end up losing to queen jack so a rivered straight definitely beats my measly pair of eights and we lose another one moving right along to the next one in this one theres a late position open to 60 and i look down at ace queen on the button pretty good cards so i bump it up to 210 dollars and get a cold call from the small blind whos the same player from last hand and the initial razer folds so not really what i was expecting but thats alright were in position going to a flop of king eight five rainbow king high board looks like a good one for me to continue betting so thats what i do 140 dollars and he makes the call the turn change is nothing its the deuce of spades he checks again and i think this time sizing up is a good idea with all my hands whether its good ones or bad ones in this case its definitely not a good one but that doesnt stop me from throwing out one thousand dollars and after some thought my opponent makes the call so definitely looking for some help now and i think we get it with the queen of diamonds on the river he checks it again and considering how the hands gone down i think were very likely up against some sort of middling pocket pair perhaps from nines up to jacks something of that nature sometimes he might have a king but given that i have an ace and theres two queens accounted for unless were up against king jack suited i dont really think its too likely so i decide to bet really small for value now this is kind of a disrespectful bet not something i would do against an opponent that i think could punish this sort of bet but this guy isnt exactly that so i put in 800 and after not much thought he lets it go still nice to take it down after losing the last few hands the very next shuffle theres a middle position limp and i raise in late position to 70 dollars with king eight suited we see a call from the big blind and the middle position limper so three ways to a flop of seven six three with one spade not really a good board for me so when it checks to me i check it back and what do you know we make top pair on the turn as the king of clubs arrives this time it checks to me and i decide to bet for value once again similar situation to last hand this isnt really recommended against opposition who can punish you for betting a hand that only looks like one pair on a board like this but these guys in this particular table i wasnt too worried about that happening so i throw out hundred and twenty dollars big blind makes the call middle position folds and we go heads up to a river which is the five of diamonds meaning any four now makes a straight she checks again and as ambitious as it may seem i think we can put in another bet try to make it look like a bluff and perhaps get hero called by a seven or a nonbelieving six sure sometimes well get called by a better hand but im okay with that so i put in 470 dollars and after a few moments she decides to check raise to some amount i fold right away and shes kind enough to show me king four of diamonds so we were in okay shape but uh straight on the river its gonna get it done in the next one theres an early position open to sixty dollars and i make it two hundred and ten dollars in late position with king jack off suit not really a hand thats strong enough to call so i think pretty much folding every time is fine and once in a while putting in the raise as a bluff so thats what i do this time and my opponent makes the call we go heads up to a flop of five deuce deuce pretty dry board usually one that im gonna have a big advantage on so when he checks i continue betting and he makes the call the turn is magical its the jack of hearts giving me a very disguised strong top pair so when he checks im happy to put in another over bet just like the hand where i had ace queen except this time ive got something so thats always nice i throw out one thousand dollars and after much thinking he decides to call so things are looking up here until the river comes the ace of clubs now i dont necessarily think he has an ace in fact i think its very unlikely hes got one but the reason this card sucks so much is now its very impossible to get more value from hands like pocket tens or nines or eights you guys get the idea so when he checks it a third time after some thought i decide to just check it back i guess and we end up winning against pocket tens could have gone for some value there but whatever we win anyway and that brings us to the next hand where once again weve got king jack off suit this time i opened a 50 and only the big blind calls and what do you know we finally get an amazing flop today its queen 10 9 with two diamonds thats right we flopped the stone cold nuts with the king of diamonds as a backup plan she checks i bet 60 and im happy to see she makes the call turns the deuce of hearts she checks again and this time i decide to size up thinking she could have a queen or any sort of draw shes probably not going to fold those hands so i toss in 300 and sure enough she does make the call once again though we get a disappointing river as the king of hearts comes out not necessarily expecting her to have a jack too often but once again its tough to get value from worse so this time when she checks i size down a little bit to 330 dollars no small chunk of change but you know relative to the pot and after some thought she does make the call so i turn it over and we end up winning versus king queen of spades so quite the fortunate situation there and the next one i have ace 10 off suit on the button i raise it up to 50 and only the straddler makes the call so two of us going to a flop which is a good one its ace seven three with two hearts he checks i bet small and surprisingly he check raises but he also chooses a small sizing its only 70 dollars not sure what to make of this but i throw in the 40 more and we see the six of hearts on the turn this time he slows down and checks it and now i think betting small with pretty much all my hands is the way to go including top pair with a semiweak flush draw i know it might seem a little bit weird to do this but anyway i put in the 80 and he makes the call so i think we still have the best hand and when the river comes the six of clubs i shouldnt really change much so when he checks it i decided to go for some more value its pretty thin considering that he check raised on the flop and called a bet on the turn not really sure what worst hands we can target here but i think smaller aces are going to pay off a small size so thats what i like to do throwing in 130 dollars and sure enough my opponent tosses in the call and my opponent flashes us the ace of diamonds so that one works out nicely and we move right along to the following hand where theres a small blind open to sixty dollars and im in the big blind with pocket sevens could call could raise this time i choose the more fun option and make it 220 dollars straddler folds on my left and now the small blind decides that he wants to raise again as well making it one thousand dollars to go now with my hand we could go either way between seeing a flop in position or just letting it go but for some reason i was catching a vibe that this guy had a hand like ace king or you know some big cards so i proceed with the call and we go to a flop of jack 10 5 rainbow he bets 400 dollars around one fifth the size of the pot considering that we still be ace highs i make the call and we see the nine of spades on the turn this time he checks and i check it back and what do you know we make a straight on the river with the eight of diamonds my opponent checks it an unexpected strong hand appearing out of nowhere for myself obviously we still lose to any queen but after he checks it a second time i dont think its very likely hes got one um i guess he could have a hand like ace queen and hes planning to check raise but i doubt he would do that when it doesnt really look like i would have a hand thats gonna bet i decided thats small i dont really expect to get called by worse but who knows maybe i was wrong and he does have a hand like pocket aces so i put in nine hundred dollars but after a few seconds he gets out of the way and did later tell me he had ace king so again another good result with a semi mediocre hand and that ladies and gentlemen brings us to the last hand of the night theres a late position open to 60 dollars and im on the button with ace eight of hearts again a hand that i think its okay to call or raise with this time i raise it up making it 220 dollars and my opponent makes a call so we go heads up to a flop of queen six six two spades one club not much going on for me but i decide to bet small anyway think doing this with all my hands makes sense and who knows we might even get a fold from a better ace high for example or maybe a small pocket pair no such luck though as my opponent makes the call and we see another queen on the turn definitely not looking to continue bluffing on this card so when he checks it i check it back and we see the eight of diamonds on the river once again though my opponent checks i think this might be some sort of bait dont really expect to get folds on a board like this anyway so i check it back right away and sure enough we end up losing to queen jack of hearts nice hand man anyway that was the end of the session not a ton of action this time but still some fun hands and as always i hope you guys enjoyed the hands music okay so good news and bad news the bad news is i ended up losing around thirteen or fourteen hundred dollars over the course of seven very boring hours at the win 510 tables the good news is there was a really cool subscriber who brought me a bottle of tequila i mean how cool is this guy seriously thanks a lot i think his name was vincent yeah vincent that really made me feel a lot better about that money lost but anyway thats the conclusion of todays session not very exciting not anything really worth mentioning but thats how it goes sometimes and you know im not only going to include vlogs where things are insane so either way i hope you guys enjoyed it and i think theres one more video coming from vegas dont hold me to that but im going to try all right im going to try to do like either another tournament or a cash game video i guess well have to see but anyway thats it for today guys as always thank you so much for watching thanks for all the support and until next time good luck at the tables im gonna go get some chipotle make myself feel better music you

vEAlw1WGdsY,chelsea are interested in juventus centreback matthijs de ligt,Sport,talked about uh paul pogba on his way to juventus and how juventus finance that gave me some insight on to who could be leaving to make some money look one of the interesting players at juventus who could be leaving this summer is matthias de licht now juventus signed him what is it three years ago uh 75 million euros hes still only 22 years old hes arguably one of the best centrebacks in the world and according to sky italy chelsea are interested in signing him now i think it would be a difficult deal to pull off he has a release clause of 120 million euros which is around 103 million pounds and juventus would want that release clause paid or something very close to that release clause now we know chelsea are looking for a centreback uh licht has been a longterm target but there are other centrebacks theyre looking at as well jules kunday at sevilla is somebody theyve been after for a very very long time what we do know is that chelsea will sign a centreback this summer because theyve lost tony rudiger theyre losing under ass christianson as well they will sign somebody i think it will be somebody world class and delict definitely fits the bill and according to sky italy theyre very interested in him whats interesting is that hes got the same agent as paul pogba and those agents today are in milan speaking to juventus so were just putting two and two together and thinking after theyve finished talking about paul pogba will they also today talk about matthias theyre licked and chelseas interested but if they met that kind of release clause that would send a quite a message about the intent and the financial intent of the new chelsea regime wouldnt it yes absolutely and hes very handson early uh todd burley hes hes taken the lukaku deal in his own hands and whats the first thing hes done a year ago the kaku joining chelsea for around 100 million now hes got to deal with the same club the selling club back then the now loan buying club for around 10 million pounds the car could take him pay cuts etcetera and hes working alongside thomas tuchel i think in the structure what thomas tuchels used to he just wants to be on the training field he doesnt really want to get involved too much in the negotiations so i find it fascinating that a man whos not used to english football getting so involved so handson this early at his tenure at chelsea music

VUXpU_vnNYE,nightly news full broadcast  june 24,News, tonight the  landmark ruling the  supreme court  overturning roe v wade taking away the  constitutional right  to abortion protests and  celebrations erupting  outside the court  after the historic 54 decision overturning  nearly 50 years of  abortion rights  leaving the matter up  to states now to  decide   it feels like a  betrayal  a complete and  utter joy that it was  finally  overturned  the majority  opinion written by  just samuel alito  saying roe was  egregiously wrong from the start the three liberal  justices in their  dissent warning  millions of american  women have lost a  fundamental  constitutional  protection the impact roughly  half the states  expected to ban  abortion 13 states with trigger laws banning abortion  immediately or soon clinics in several  states already turning women away president biden  calling this a sad day for america framing  the upcoming mid terms as an allout battle  for abortion rights and the far reaching  fallout could a  national ban on  abortion be in the  future and how justice  clarence thomas tied  open the tour  questioning the rights to samesex marriage and  contraception as well  and the first gun  legislation passed in  years now on its way to the  presidents desk   and our nbc news  exclusive oneonone  with ukrainian  president volodymyr  zelenskyy his message about the  americans captured  while fighting in  ukraine what he is now vowing  to do   announcer this is  nbc nightly news  with lester holt   good evening  everyone where do privacy and  personal freedom  begin and where do  they end questions that framed an enduring  divide in a modern  american one many  thought was settled 50 years ago when the  supreme court affirmed the constitutional  right to an abortion today the court answered that question again this time in a  54 vote taking away  what was regarded as a fundamental right right now new laws  banning abortion are  taking effect in  several states just  hours after the supreme  court overturned the  roe versus wade  decision leaving it to states to determine  whether abortion is  illegal justice samuel alito  in his opinion writing roe was  egregiously wrong from the start a draft leaked weeks  a draft of the  decision looekd to the public weeks something took away the suspense of the moment but not the euphoria of  opponents or the  determination of  abortion supporters heres the scene right now of crowds gathered outside the supreme  court in protest and  celebration our team ready to  cover it all starting with pete williams  reporter outside  the court now ringed  with a security fence opponents of abortion  rights cheered  cleat and utter joy that it was finally  overturned but the determination it is a determination but the battle is not  over   we have a voice in  our demands   we have a voice in  our demands   reporter for  others it was what  they were dreading  ever since the court  signaled in december  it was likely to  overturn roe   it feels like a  betrayal feels like  my country doesnt  love me and appreciate my body as a woman  reporter the court overturned nearly 50  years in abortion  precedence in a ruling that was a first never before has the  court granted then  taken away a widely  recognized  constitutional right the court voted 54 to overturn roe chief justice john  roberts said going  that far wasnt  necessary to uphold  mississippis law  banning abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy the court voted 63 to uphold that law the majority opinion  overturning roe  tracked closely with  the version that leaked in may touching off nationwide  protests including at  the homes of some of  the courts  conservatives justice samuel alitos majority opinion said  no right to abortion  is protected by any  supreme court  decision the decision in roe  was he fwreej rousely  wrong and damaging  like winston  churchill said this is the end of the  beginning it has been a 50 year  battle to protect  unborn child now we have those  battles in every  states   reporter unlike a  court rulings based on a right to privacy  alito says this is  different because it  involves a potential  right so he said it does not undermine the rights  to samesex marriage  or contraception  though justice  clarence thomas said  the court should take  another look at them  too the ruling does not  make abortion illegal but it is no longer a  constitutional right  soy it leaves the  issue up to each  state it is likely to become illegal soon in about  half the nation some states already  banned it as of  tonight the rest of the banned states are like will  he to follow in the  coming weeks just brett kavanaugh  said ban states cannot make it a crime for  their constituents to  travel to a state  where it is legal others said the court  ruling means from the  moment of  fertilization a women  has no rights to speak of they said a state  can force her to keep  a baby to term even at the steepest personal  and family costs  people are going to be heading to the  streets in the wake of this decision  immediately and in the days and months to  come and making clear  that the majority of the  people in the united  states support  abortion rights   pete is joining us  now from outside the  supreme court pete what has it been like out there today  well this is the  biggest crowd i have  ever seen outside the  supreme court after a  decision it has been building  steadily all day people celebrating  and mourning the  decisions while it does return  the issue to the  states the dissenters say there is nothing  in this ruling that  would prevent congress from banning abortion  nationwide if it ever  chose to  lester  all right pete thank you   the ripple effect  was immediate just after the  decision some of those trigger laws already  in effect some women  unable to get abortion services planned for  today blayne alexander with  more now from  mississippi   reporter outside  the mississippi clinic at the heart of  todays supreme court  decision   we do abortions  and we are proud to do abortions   reporter

clinic  will shut down for  good   i will tell you  that any patient that  contacts us we will  see them we will make sure we  see them in those ten  days  reporter but  change is already  happening of the 13 trigger law states  abortion is now  illegal with a few  exceptions in at least five of them following todays ruling  including missouri  oklahoma and  arkansas where  through tears the  attorney general  signed the  certification late  today   restoring to the  state of arkansas the  authority to prohibit  abortion  reporter in  wisconsin planned  parenthood immediately stopped abortions  following todays  ruling the medical director  had to break the news  to patients already in the waiting room   today i had to look people in the eye and  turn them away when  they were seeking  abortion  reporter across  the country emotional reaction on both  sides   my first reaction  was rage  this is an amazing  victory   reporter while  some lawmakers  celebrate the  decision   this is a profound  change in the law in  our country and it  will save millions of  lives of unborn  children   reporter others   my wife is in  tears my kids are incredibly distraught my sister says i  thought the courts  were there to protect  our freedoms not roll them back   reporter back in  mississippi todays  ruling is a victory  for terry herring   my eyes just filled with tears this is a day to  rejoice   reporter she has  spent nearly 30 years  fighting to end  abortion and says  shes proud  mississippi played a  role what does today mean  for you  you know  personally you know  we didnt know if this would happen in our  lifetime right we have been  advocating for a long  time so seeing this happen  in my lifetime and  knowing that we had an opportunity to be a  part of that is  it  means us being a part  of changing history   reporter but for  tyler harden who runs  planned parenthood in  the state you have gotten dozen  of calls since this  decision came down  uhhuh   reporter are women scared  yes and to be honest im  scared as well  reporter the  closest clinic she  says will be in  florida a sevenhour  drive   people will have to find funds the travel people will have to find funds to get  hotels rooms buy  food   reporter is that a feasible option for  them  it is not   blaine joins us now from mississippi i know one of the  issue particularly  there is the ability to travel out  of state it is particularly  hard for many women   thats right  lester especially  here in mississippi  which has the highest  poverty rate of any  state in the country especially among black women the group who  they say will be most  impacted by todays  decision both sides do agree on one thing they say focus should  be made on getting  women the resources  they need for a safe  pregnancy and beyond   president biden  condemned todays  decision stating that  roe will be on the  ballot in this years  midterm elections kbhil conservative  republicans applauded  the ruling peter alexander from  the white house   reporter a somber president biden saying it is a low moment for the nations highest  court   a sad day for the  court and for the  country now with roe gone  lets be very clear  the health and life of women in this nation  are now at risk   reporter the white house mindful of how  personal this ruling  is inviting more than a dozen senior aides  all women to witness  the president calling the decision  the result of an  extreme ideology   it was three  justices named by one  president  donald  trump make no mistake this decision is a  culmination of a  deliberate effort over decades of said  imbalance of our low   reporter top  republicans touting  the ruling as a  hardwon victory   the right to life  has been vindicated the voiceless will  finally have a voice   it will save  countless innocent  children   reporter two  prominent senators  now suggest they were mislead by  assurances made during recent confirmation  hearings   roe v wade is a  important precedent of the supreme court  a good judge will  consider it as  precedent of the  united states supreme  court   reporter  republican susan  collins slamming this decision as inconsistent with  those justices  testimony what comes next with his authority  limited president  biden is calling on  congress to guarantee  the right to an  abortion but senate democrats  dont have votes for  that the president vowing  his administration  will protect access to fda approved  medications like  abortion pills and contraception and  defending womens  rights to travel to  other states where  abortion remains  league 63 of americans do  not believe roe should be overturned democrats including  the nations first  woman vice president  hoping to redirect  that outrage to this  falls midterm  elections   you have the final  word so this is not over  this fall roe is  on the ballot   reporter a  defining cultural  clash in a country now even more deputily  divided president biden  justice thomas said this could lead to  other personal  freedoms being rolled  back   thats right he  said the right the  conscious  the right to samesex marriage and  contraception should  be reconsidered taking the court down an  extreme and dangerous  path   thank you peter  alexander i want to turn to  yamiche we heard the president and house speaker  saying this fall roe  is essentially on the   ballots in this  midterms but to what  end  the political  fallout was immediate ahead of the midterm  democrats will be  hammering home the  point of voters that  poll show the majority of  americans want  abortion to be legal  in some form but the reality is  this is not a  oneissue election democrats will be  trying to focus on abortion  while americans are  juggling record high gas prices and  historic inflation trs the culmination of conservative activist there is a strategy in the senate to create a conservative majority  on the court the question is will republicans face  backlash or will it  strengthen their move  to ban apportion what is clear is that  abortion will likely  be a top issue in the  mid terms as this new  political landscape takes shape  with abortion  restrictions likely in more than half the  country some states  where it will remain  league are  anticipating an influx of patients from  elsewhere some providers are  even relocating heres stephanie gosk  reporter with the  stroke of a pen the  supreme court has  likely triggered a  mass ive abortion migration in  this country more than 300000  abortions were  performed last year  this the 26 states  where the pressure  could soon be illegal  or highly restricted now those people may  choose to cross state lines in tennessee the  attorney general wants the states sixweek  ban to start right  now  the people of  tennessee for the  first time in 50  years will have a  chance to weigh in on  this issue  this is where we do our abortion  procedures back here  these are your  apportion procedure  rooms you have two  rooms  yes   reporter we  visited the choices  health care clinic in  memphis soon the doors to  these rooms will be  closed for good  our patients are  predominantly black the majority of them  are uninsured or underinsured   they have been  bracing for this court decision for months   we all thought  this is going to be  bad for us so i said to my  executive team there is a place  called carbondale  reporter it is in  southern illinois  three hours from  member sis where they plan to open a  new clinic in august they were reluctant to show us pictures  because of security  issues this clinician will be driving back and  forth   will it be big  enough to handle what  could be a flood of  patients  thats a good  question i dont know i think we will be the only clinic right now  in the southern part  of illinois we will handle as many patients as we can   reporter in some  states where abortion  will still be legal  access is being  expanded connecticut passed a  law allowing nonphysicians to  provide abortions antiabortion  activists hope  increasing support  systems during  pregnancy will change peoples minds

AB7J_BbOeKk,huge lego wolverine art jurassic world mosasaurus cars  more,Art,hey everybody welcome back its jordan here today were going to be taking a look at some lego and its actually 10 jams lego hes been a member on the channel for quite some time and weve built a pretty cool friendship and actually had the pleasure of meeting him when i was at brickworld chicago and he had some pretty awesome stuff on display at brickworld so we had the opportunity of interviewing him so were going to take a look at all of the art that he had on display at brickworld chicago pretty neat and were also going to take a look at all of the other stuff that hes designed as well which includes a really cool jurassic world display a couple cool vehicles some more art and just some really neat stuff so lets take a look at the stuff that he had at brookwood chicago via this interview right now right now were checking out tan jams booth look at the incredible art that he has built uh can you tell us a little bit about your art here tenjim yeah so i got three pieces here ive got uh well start with obiwan kenobi i call this one high ground and its supposed to be the episode three or the clone wars version of general kenobi and freehanded the the dot work on the background to look like mustafar so thats all freehanded kind of in the same style as the iron man ultimate art with the blue and the black background but i put in some reds and dark reds oranges that kind of color but that ones uh pretty appropriate given uh were almost done with the kenobi show and then uh ive got this the second piece that i did i call it one with the force here and this one is uh is representative of that iconic scene from mandalorian season two with ahsoka and uh says when we finally learned the childs name and uh an ahsoka and grogu bond for the first time so i wanted to capture the emotion in that scene its a mix of plate work uh mainly one by ones and one by twos and uh and then some smooth tiles to help contrast with the with the artwork and then my final piece uh i call it snickt this is inspirational of the john byrne wolverine art in the uh in the late 80s early 90s in the xmen run and uh i actually created this one for an instagram challenge i created as a digital build and um and never intended to build it at all and uh and then i got a got a decent reaction to it and decided uh to price it out and actually uh actually build it as my showpiece for for the convention so this ones uh you know kind of pulled out all the stops here ive got a mixture of several different size of plate ive got some one by one studs laid over the top of the plate the lettering comes out a brick tall as well and then some some cheese wedges alternating cheese wedges and then the the pies the resistance defending finishing touch was just putting the wolverine claws around the outside edge so uh 228 wolverine claws made up the framing pieces here its incredible man i love your art its fantastic and you know what this one here is like sitting in the perfect spot because the cheese wedges just sort of like pick up the light and it just looks like its almost like his claws are like literally shining i appreciate that yeah yeah very cool then you got some other little things here too yep ive got a few few other little uh little builds here uh the brickhead i designed to go after my beach bum sig fig uh so we get uh we got the beach bum he actually has a a shell gas station piece to represent his necklace and thats from 1970 the shell gas station thats a printed printed piece got the little hermit crab behind beside him weve got the uh the legendary walkietalkie a lot of people have thought this was the target walkietalkie this is actually brick built here and uh and i actually made it so you can depress the talk button ive got some springs in here so you can depress the talk button and you built that with all lego right that is all brick its impressive how you get the actual function of pressing the button absolutely yes my kids tried to tell me to actually make it you know put a walkietalkie in there but i just uh couldnt fit one inside actually talk and then the last piece i have here is the uh this is after one of the sets i had as a kid this is the wolf pack uh shield so ive got the little wolf pack guy here and this is just all all plate work plate and tile and then it actually does have the handle on the back here to represent the shield thats such a cool idea of building like a mini thing accessory or anything having to do with minifigure and just like super sizing it i think thats just an incredible idea inspiration from the hogwarts icons collection right just that kind of set the stage to do that large size build stuff thats pretty awesome man well thanks for having us thanks for having me here at the show it looks fantastic and i cant wait to see what you come up with in the future thanks jordan so definitely some incredible artwork that was on display i was blown away by that wolverine i also really liked the minifig sort of blowing up stuff like the shield and the walkietalkie crazy how the walkietalkie was actually functional like the button press and the knobs turned and stuff like that i mean you couldnt actually like you know communicate through it but i really enjoyed that i think its really neat i cant wait to see what he comes up with next with like the minifig scale stuff so not only did he have the stuff on display at the show but hes also got some stuff on rebreakable and hes got a custom jurassic world scene that he put together using the studio program so lets take a look at that because it was actually submitted to brick huntresss competition on instagram where everyone had to come up with different uh jurassic world themed creations and submit them there and then they were sort of like a competition style and it was actually voted the winner so lets have a detailed look at that so this thing is absolutely amazing weve got the mosasaurus bursting out of the water there all the water detail around it is fantastic it is a mills plate as well so you can see the open technic pins there so it can clip into other modules and you can see the mosasaurus is just highly detailed its bursting out of the water there biting onto the shark and then theres also these stands as well with all of the excited fans of the mosasaurus or excited jurassic world attendees and heres another angle of the model so you can see all the detail of the mosasaurus its got the proper colored interior of his mouth its got the teeth also a nice combination of studs and smooth finish with all of the different curved slopes plates angle plates and then also the transition of the color to the light slash dark gray on the bottom or the belly of the mosasaur so its like spot on it is simply amazing also the stands is very detailed with the masonry bricks the light gray bricks that sort of curve over top and then its got the sort of roof that thing looks spectacular and then our last image of it is the birds eye view image where you can see theres a string thats holding that shark in place for the mosasaurus to jump up and grab it and here you can see some of the water detail as well theres a couple different colors that are used there to create some really nice water detail so how about that hey that is a pretty awesome mock it was once again done on studio he hasnt actually built it but i believe hes planning on building that one uh which is pretty cool and once again it won uh the jurassic world competition hosted by brick huntress on instagram which is uh pretty special pretty cool so theres a couple other things that uh i want to show you we actually have two of them right here on my desk and these are some vehicles that are available on rebrickablecom weve got a police cruiser and also a taxi cab so lets have a detailed look at those and then theres a couple other things as well so the first one is a yellow taxi i really like this design here it looks phenomenal and the instructions are available on rebrickablecom for one dollar which isnt too bad it is missing a taxi print piece right there the design does call for that but i didnt get that one there and you can open up the interior just by removing the top just like that there and you can actually see theres space for quite a few minifigures there is a back seat and a front seat there nicely detailed for sure also the trunk will open up just like that there so you can stow away like a briefcase or a suitcase in there which is definitely pretty cool so theres a lot of functionality to the set and i really enjoy how theres you know space for multiple minifigures inside and then also space for you know something in the trunk i think thats a little bit different and it sort of differentiates itself from some of the ones that we see from official lego sets actually so thats a really cool little yellow taxi there the next one is a police cruiser once again available on rebrickablecom and this one was a little build here that was pretty fun to put together once again you can take that off there there is room uh for i believe three minifigures two in the front seat and uh one in the back seat i put a vintage police officer in there that was actually sent to us from a fan out of the uk his name is rob so thank you rob for uh sending that but i put my vint vintage uh policeman in there and its really highly detailed and looks pretty fantastic instructions for one dollar you really cant go wrong if you want a custom police cruiser for your city definitely a good way of going and im just doing this for the goodness of my heart i love tangent well i okay i dont know i do love the guy hes a beauty uh hes helped us out uh in so many different ways here on the channel and uh it was a pleasure meeting him in chicago so theres actually a couple other things that i want to show you that tan jam has uh created the first one is a darth sidious art and thats actually right over here in the lego room on our art wall of course so we actually created this one here this one is darth sidious and he is just hanging out right there above darth maul i can just envision him uh from uh whats it called uh the revenge of the sith my green little friend right everybodys about to duel uh yoda i just think thats so cool so he did come up with that one there and it blends together perfectly with uh all of the different art sets here on the wall of the sith arts and the instructions are actually free and all you need is a sith art to build that one one other one that he did design was darth revan as well and once again all you need is a sith art to build that one heres an image of it now see how that one looks pretty good ive decided not to do that one there i dont know much backstory on darth revan but he also created the brixi sigfig art so he created this uh all of those art sets that you saw at the show and then also uh this one here and darth revan yeah so pretty cool hey looks fantastic our art wall is filling up and i cant wait to add more in the future so he has the castaway as his sig fig which is part of the cmf series and he actually designed a custom brickhead i dont have the brickhead im just showing you my brickheadz here but he built a or designed a custom brick head of the castaway check it out right now so definitely a pretty cool brickhead there i enjoyed that one he had it at the show it looked pretty snazzy and theres a couple other things that actually one other thing that he helped us out with in particular here in the lego city he actually designed custom street lights and those are available on rebrickablecom as well i think those ones are free the instructions for those ones which is pretty neat im looking at this portion of the city looking for a street light this is the only portion of the city thats complete at this point but clearly theres no need for traffic lights there so i actually have all of them stowed away right here and eventually well be reintegrating these into the lego city so he also built these and provided the instructions on rebrickablecom so pretty cool traffic light design and of course eventually one day were going to put all of those back in the lego city so some pretty killer stuff there thank you so much tanjam for uh you know inspiring lego builders with your crazy creations and also providing them unrebrickable pretty awesome man do appreciate it and it was a pleasure meeting you in chicago it was such a good time and im glad that we had the opportunity of checking out all of your stuff everybody thank you so much for popping on by let us know what you think by

_t4ru1_xAH4,stop dont buy an ipad right now,Tech,we’re now only around 3 months away from apple’s september event where we’re expecting apple to reveal their brand new 10thgeneration budget ipad and in this video i’m gonna try to answer the question that’s on a lot of people’s minds right now will the new ipad 10 come with a full redesign just like we got with all of the other ipads like the ipad pro the ipad air and the ipad mini or will apple choose to stick around with the old design for just another year and this is a very important question because it can and should easily make or break somebody’s decision on whether to wait until this new ipad or buy something right now like the current ipad 9 on sale for 309 well in this video i’m gonna work through a bunch of leaks and combine that with common sense and some key points from apple’s previous ipad lineup strategy to give you guys my own personal prediction for if apple is gonna redesign the ipad this year and what that’ll mean for the pricing and features so let’s get started first of all before i get into the exclusive new leaks from 9to5mac i want to make the point that apple’s budget ipad is essentially like the youngest kid in the family who receives all of the handmedowns from older siblings for example the current budget ipad 9 comes with the pretty old a13 chip which first showed up in the iphone 11 back in 2019 it was also the very last ipad in the entire lineup to finally get upgraded from 32gb of base storage up to 64 and that makes sense because it’s only 329 hence why everyone calls it the budget ipad and this handmedown point is actually gonna be incredibly useful for this video because we can take a look in the past and see how long it took for some of the main key features to make it’s way from apple’s higherend ipads over to the budget ipad and then take what we learn from that and apply it to the whole redesign debacle and for these comparisons i want to stick to the smallersized ipad pro and ipad air models that are the most similar to the current budget ipad getting started apple pencil support came to the 97” ipad pro in early 2016 and it only came to the 6thgen budget ipad in early 2018 so that took about 2 years to make it’s way down moving on in early 2019 the ipad air 3 received the a12 chip which only made it’s way down to the budget ipad 8 in late 2020 which is about a 15 year difference the ipad air 3 was also the first air model to come with 64gb of base storage and it wasn’t until late 2021 when the current budget ipad 9 started coming with 64gigs which is a 25 year difference on top of that the air 3 also received the true tone display which didn’t come to the budget ipad until this current ipad 9 which is also a 25 year difference so if we take all of that and average it out it seems like a lot of the handmedowns take around 2 to 25 years to make their way down to the budget ipad now before i apply that to the timeline of when each ipad received a full flatsided redesign i want to bust out the recent leaks and rumors we got concerning the budget ipad 10 and see if those timelines match up first of all we got a leak from the king of apple display leaks ross young who has been bang on with exact display detail leaks in the past including the 142 and 162” macbook pro displays the 83” ipad mini 6 display and even the 136” m2 macbook air display and recently he claimed that the new ipad is gonna be getting a 105” display while the ipad air will remain at 109” which totally makes sense because apple wants the more expensive ipads to have larger displays now if that 105” display size sounds familiar it should because that’s precisely the display size of the ipad air 3 in 2019 and not only that but the entire chassis and 105” display on the air 3 was actually a handmedown from the 2017 ipad pro so looking at timelines it took 2 years to get handed down from the ipad pro to the ipad air and then if the budget ipad 10 gets it this year that would be a 35 year gap so i can totally see it being overdue for a 105” display upgrade regardless of whether it actually gets a full redesign with it or not now moving onto 9to5mac’s exclusive leaks they reported that the new ipad will come with the a14 chip 5g usbc connectivity and a retina display of the same resolution as the ipad air’s display so let’s look at each of those points the a14 chip totally makes sense because that’s the chip that the ipad air 4 got back in late 2020 so if the new ipad 10 gets it that’s a 2 year difference which is spot on and now in terms of the usbc port the ipad pro originally got it in late 2018 and then it was handed down two years later to the ipad air 4 in late 2020 and now if the ipad 10 gets it that would be another 2 years which actually lines up pretty well and the most important detail you need to realize is that whenever an ipad received the usbc port it always came hand in hand with a full redesign so if the new ipad 10 had a redesign this year that would be a solid 2 years since the ipad air 4 which i believe lines up quite well to all of the handmedown comparisons i made in this video so with that said i want to dig into the common sense evidence both for and against the idea of the ipad 10 receiving a redesign this year before i give you guys my final prediction first of all this is gonna be the 10thgeneration ipad which is kind of perfect because apple waited until the 10thanniversay iphone to give it a massive redesign with stainless steel bands and face id but the 1 reason why it makes sense for this ipad to get a redesign is because the exclusive information from 9to5mac has been very reliable in the past and the fact that their sources believe the usbc port is coming to the budget ipad is a huge deal because in the past usbc ports were only ever added to ipads if and when they received a full flatsided redesign and the reason this makes sense is because the usbc port is fairly fragile since it’s a female connector that also has a floating male component in the middle of the port which can potentially get damaged compared to lightning which is fully female and can’t really get damaged for example there have been cases where actual usbc ports became loose and eventually damaged requiring full replacement of the port itself instead of simply buying a new damaged lightning cable which shows that usbc isn’t as reliable so if this new ipad 10 comes with a new usbc port while reusing the old chamfered chassis design it would cause major problems because the usbc port would be cut diagonally into the rounded frame so if you plug in a usbc cable the bottom side wouldn’t have as much support as the top leading to a potentially loose cable which would break the internal components because of this i fully believe that the ipad absolutely needs flat sides so that the usbc port is completely flat and level on the side of the ipad making for the most stable and reliable connection and that’s why i think apple only added usbc alongside a full redesign not only that but if apple wants to discontinue the 1stgen apple pencil the ipad also needs a full flatsided redesign to support the magnetic wireless charging feature so with that said it seems very likely that we get a full redesign but keep in mind that when apple redesigned the ipad pro they raised the price by 150 and then the same thing for both the ipad mini and ipad air both raised by 100 so a redesign for the budget ipad would likely mean that the price will go up to 399 which i think is completely fair because the redesign will be a huge deal since it’ll honestly cannabilize the sales of the more expensive ipad air especially since the a14 chip is more than powerful enough for a lot of people and on top of that redesigning the ipad 10 makes sense because it’ll allow apple to sell even more 2ndgen apple pencils since the 1stgen ones will no longer be supported forcing people to upgrade to the new one with wireless charging support and not only that but they could even make a new magic keyboard case for the 105” size to sell even more accessories and of course all of the usbc chargers adapters and accessories that apple sells as well however there is a chance that apple doesn’t redesign the ipad 10 this year because as we all know this year’s iphone 14 lineup will continue to use lightning until next year when the iphone 15 lineup is gonna finally make the switch to usbc so if apple wanted to they could totally wait on a full budget ipad redesign until next year and this could also make sense for apple because it would boost the sales of the more expensive ipads and there’s also the fact that apple could easily reuse that same 105” chassis with the old design from both the 2019 ipad air and the 2017 ipad pro which would be the cheapest and easiest route for an incremental update but that would of course mean no usbc port but in terms of my personal prediction i have a feeling that 9to5mac’s sources are right about usbc coming to budget ipad which i think means we will be getting a full redesign and you should definitely wait 3 more months until that ipad comes out before you make a major purchasing decision so hopefully this video was helpful and if it was go ahead and click that circle above to subscribe for more videos like this one and definitely check out one of

9oSCNT7oB2g,making art with the new poscas,Art,music hey its hey hey its me today im going to be making some art with a new product that ive never used before and im very excited about it here they are books no its not books these are paint markers i am currently obsessed with posca paint pens oh gosh pastas i love pasta so much the only problem i have with pastas really is the limited color range this is a whole different brand of paint marker and as you can see there are a ton of colors available so if these work as well as poscas i will make the switch right now my loyalty goes wherever the color is i actually heard about these from chloe her channel is chloe roseart and she does art she actually reached out to me because she tested them out on her channel and noticed a bunch of people in the comments saying that i should use them how thoughtful and sweet and kind of you guys as soon as she showed me these i was like yes im buying them i saw the price and i said okay im still buying them there are a ton of markers in here if you bought this many pasta pens it wouldnt be cheap either put that back they are called karen markers each box has kind of a different theme im not overly excited about the gray box so lets get this one over with very nice box pop this open wow fancy they have this little card in here for swatching and probably wont use it but its in there its a nice thought in the gray box surprise weve got a lot of gray they also get quite green i would definitely not call this color gray okay that can be gray this one basic colors next nature colors that was a monkey for nature well see when all of them are combined how much of each color we have nude colors this is like a very repetitive christmas oh lovely i know theyre supposed to be for like skin tones and stuff but i see desserts next passion colors whatever that means this is what passion colors look like they look kind of random to me this is the one that im really looking forward to it is the pastel colors poscas definitely dont have any good pastel colors this is closer to pastel than what pasca has to offer so i am excited to use these it would look much prettier if they were in rainbow order but thats just me i have no idea what im gonna use these markers on ill figure something out so lets get into doing that now welcome to my blue workspace and the markers are here thats me clapping im gonna go ahead and pick pick pick pull all of these out and were left with this very beautiful very expensive packaging but unfortunately i dont really need it so im just gonna im just gonna put it to the side um maybe itll find a purpose over there on the side yeah next okay yeah im taking the markers out of the packaging which means im gonna be tossing all of it having all the markers separated out like this its not going to be conducive to my creativity and i really hate to do it look at that loving caress but throwing all these markers in one big container is just going to be way less annoying so its a good buy my dear enjoy the rest of your life in the trash and thank you for nothing its a box im over it geez im like a wild animal and finally here are all the markers naked and free it is now clear just how many there are here and im gonna go ham swatching honestly i kind of hate swatching i hate swatching as much as i hate saying the word swatching swatching swatching its just not how i prefer to spend my time i mean look at that thats so boring but i felt like it was necessary to really lay out all of the colors and i really wanted to see the full color range ah will it ever end oh there we go it ended and ignore that little mark its just here to ruin my life really in with the drama now its clear that there is in fact a pretty even balance of colors here could have used a few more brown and tans and less gray but thats fine moving on i needed to decide what exactly to use these pens on you know how i get with decisions i tend to lose it i got so overwhelmed by the choice i ended up sitting right back down and just pulling out a piece of paper at first i was thinking i was going to customize something really cool and unique you know like a like a a a underwear i dont know but then i thought ive never used these markers before so i just want to you know get a feel for them so i literally sketched out the first thing that came to mind i started sketching so quickly im not even sure my brain fully processed what i was doing whats my hand doing i dont know in my mind this was just a test run im just messing around here what what what am i doing ill im going in with the color so i thought that these were just like poscas so i was creating somewhat of a blocky kind of cartoon style which is what i end up doing with poscas most of the time but then while i was painting this little star i noticed that they actually do kind of blend thanks to the flexible brush tip which is actually very different from the one thats on the posca so i started kind of you know trying that out messing around with the blending a little bit also i wanted to test out as many colors as i could so i end up making some very interesting color choices what have i done it looks like a half digested globe yes let me attempt to explain what exactly im drawing here first i have to figure it out myself you know you can tell by the evolution of this mysterious earthy orb that i have no clue what im doing this drawing started as lollipops and popsicles very simple but then i thought you know how are they standing up on their own am i going to draw another mysteriously balanced popsicle no i decided that this is going to be a closeup of the top of a cake so then they turned into like little cake toppers i could lie and say yeah this is going perfectly and its working just how i wanted im really doing a good job but i think its pretty obvious i was struggling a lot like a lot a lot a lot these markers definitely worked differently than i expected when i was swatching them they seemed pretty opaque but once i started using them i realized they are not trying to layer a lighter color on top of a darker color no worky the lighter the color the more transparent they are it was very difficult to get a clean color on top of another color they kind of mixed oh no even if you wait for it to dry and add another layer it does the same thing again so this was not really going according to plan not that i really even had a plan but if i did have a plan it would not be this i am still just trying to get to know this supply and see what it does but im also aware that ive spent enough time on this where i need to try to get this drawing where it looks decent i just want to make it look decent and then call it done and then i can move on to the real artwork quick break because this video is sponsored by honey hey hey you did you just say that you love shopping online but hate spending time searching the internet

honey on the go saving money wherever you are add honey to your computer and your iphone today its free go to joinhoneycom mariah and thank you to honey for sponsoring this video now the reason i love using paint pens is theyre just easy to use you can get clean details crisp lines easy layering but i actually found these pens difficult to use they didnt feel like poscas at all really in fact they felt a lot more like watercolor but dry i dont i dont get it i dont know but i just wanted to go with it so i just kind of stopped comparing them to poscas at all and just try to use them as they are i want to love you for you and not because youre similar to pasca because honestly sweetie i dont think you really compare things are getting quite weird in this drawing im not using any sort of reference obviously what am i doing my colors have all gone completely whack obviously i kind of hate it but im continuing to sink more and more time into it which is making me think that i really need to salvage this this is gonna be a big part of the video now im gonna really have to hustle when i get to the real artwork maybe its because theyre just floating here with no background im gonna add a nice little setting itll be good for them so i started working on creating the top of the cake im attempting to draw frosting here with a very driedout gray marker that doesnt really work it looks more like snow so its looking very much like a winter scene from a candy land on planet nauphilophagus tell me you know all about planet nafloff what did i say nafolophagus yeah you know its that planet where giant chaotic orbs of candy rainbows and stars grow out of the ground some of them wearing bow ties some of them dripping also it snows im still under the impression that im making a cake this is cake so i went ahead and put sprinkles on the cake thats what i thought i was doing in reality i was adding space rocks on nautholaphagus i guess ill do the sprinkle song though still maybe some sort of alien remix music yeah that was weird okay so this does not look how i was envisioning in any way at all but some strange part of me the really strange part of me actually liked this im almost embarrassed to say but i think i really just need to take it to the next level go crazy im several hours in at this point and its becoming clear that ive chosen this the real artwork that ive been waiting to do doesnt exist this is the real artwork are you disappointed me too i might as well make it good because its clear that this is all im gonna have time for so im gonna try to do something cool for the background and just hope and pray that this all ends up okay and we can get out of this nightmare eventually and this is just a very quick reminder about my character yearbook i introduced this and explained all about it in my art room tour part two for those of you who already know all about this i just want to remind you that the 28th of march is the last day to order it which is only a couple days from now so just just wanted to remind you this is where it becomes very clear that these markers are not great for large areas i dont know if i got a bad batch or something but a lot of them were very dry to the point where i could not even really get the color to flow i mean i shook them up i gave them a rest to see if that helps i did all of it they were just barely working just enough for me to lay down a very patchy color it was mainly the lighter colors it was very similar to working with like a fiveyearold crayola marker that you dug out of the bottom of your junk drawer which is somewhat disappointing considering these markers are three hundred dollars i feel like its either that i got a bad batch or its just me maybe i have toxic fingers obviously chloe was doing just fine with these she didnt seem to be having any problem look at that juicy pen really but of course im here just struggling my eyes out why am i having problems im out here making art that literally makes no sense creating this background was a lot of layering and blending because i was combining like five different pens that had no ink in them and then the top was like very dark colors that were really hard to blend together so i spent several hours just on this oh thats so embarrassing you know i should probably start playing it cool and not telling you that these things take so long you know just be like no i barely even took any time at all just whipped it up real quick i wasnt even trying definitely was not like sweating bullets trying to make something good i just pooped this out basically but no thats not the truth this is what my effort looks like you know what this was my first time using these im gonna chalk it up to inexperience i am gonna continue to try to use them and see if i can get better and maybe i just need to get used to them clearly im going for some sort of galaxy look here since we have the stars and weird planety things it all looks very alien anyway so why not i will say i really did like the precision of the brush tip because sometimes the chunkiness of the posca tip you know it just doesnt give you that delicate touch that you want once i finished with the background i was left with a giant mess just everywhere so i went through and tried to refine everything a little bit more even though im completely lost and i have no clue what im drawing at this point i kind of just want to make it look like i do know what im drawing and somehow after hours of fumbling my way through this art i have made something kind of cool right no i dont know maybe ive been staring at this for too long finally i went back and added a bunch of stars to the galaxy which is the best part of making the galaxy in my opinion i did use the white karen markers for this which actually did surprisingly well definitely still didnt turn out a super strong white but i was fine with that i did bring out my posca for the extra bright highlights where i really want the white to pop now im acting like this is just the strangest drawing ever because i really feel that it is but i showed jordan a picture of it while i was editing and i asked him what is this he said without hesitation its candy land and im like okay thats simple huh you just see it you know exactly what that is he didnt seem the least bit confused about it finally i did sign the thing shocking that i was willing to put my name on this this is the finished artwork to me this does look very confusing sincerely i feel dumb for admitting it but i actually kind of like this its very different but its kind of cool im not sure how youre gonna feel about it im sorry if you hate it but unfortunately my time was up for this video i spent way too much time on this also i do have some very large projects coming up soon and i really need to be careful with my time for the next couple of weeks in order to save enough extra time for those big projects youll see what i mean soon enough because its going to be literally large until then thank you so much for watching and i will see you guys next week bye music music i
gzzfgX0TkG0,cool tech under 50  august,Tech,whats up guys im random frank p back with another episode of cool tech under fifty dollars for august the series we show off some of the best tech you can

contact with you so you can claim your tech from last months episode and if youre trying to win drop a thumbs up and also leave a comment on your favorite item that you like in todays video but more importantly only 33 of you are actually subscribed which means 66 percent are just stopping by and not hitting that sub button so change that because obviously im only going to pick subscribers and if we flip flop that ratio we would hit 2 million subs today so if you like the content if you like the channel dont forget subscribe now first up is a super clean and minimal looking lamp absolutely love this its called the me lamp or something like that i actually first saw this in a room tour project submission and fell in love with it and was super shocked to see it was only like 40 bucks i mean tell me this isnt the perfect clean and minimal lamp right so builtin on the front is a little dial thats obviously for controlling the brightness as well as the color temperature all the way from 2700 kelvin to 6500 kelvin so you can really dial it in and it also says it has four different lighting modes things for like you know like a warm glow at night or when youre reading but obviously you can just you know manually turn it yourself and dial in that lighting depending on your situation and how much light you need in the room for your desk what i also really like is the fact that its controllable through apple homekit also through siri google assistant and amazon alexa its a lamp theres not really too many other physical features to it but like i said before the visuals is the reason why i bought it i love that super clean aesthetic and hell for 40 bucks it was a steal i currently saw on amazon it was just around 50 bucks but thats amazon for you prices are always fluctuating if you can find it definitely grab it now next is something i was admittedly thinking of not putting in this episode and maybe saving it for like a holiday edition for like a stocking stuffer or a gift idea for someone else but it really is cool and im sure a lot of you could definitely find it useful especially because we have back to school season coming up so maybe you can grab this for all your devices because its this really bizarre allinone multidevice cleaning kit so youve probably got a dirty phone laptop a tablet this little thing will help you polish up all those ports clean all that pocket lint out so six tools are built in it also comes with a microfiber cloth and this cleaning solution but tools one through three are for cleaning the ports or like the lightning usb c port on your device four and five are actually ports uh for cleaning the pins on your cables so again with lightning ports especially uh it could get like the blackened pins over time due to just damage and corrosion these will nicely clean that up for you theres also a brush tool for again like cleaning speakers the microphone uh the earpiece you just can really polish up your phone and clean out all that lint because i know for me especially like you probably dont think about it too much but considering how often our phone is in our pocket there is just so much lint that gets crammed up into your charging port regardless of whether you just solely like wirelessly charge or what there is probably a ton of gunk crammed up in your charging port and i know for me i use the one tool right away scraped out like pretty much a belly buttons worth but also i can appreciate the fact that we still do have that cleaning solution included so we can polish up the ports music so if youve noticed maybe your cables been cutting out perhaps um maybe its not even a faulty cable it could just be because the pins and the connectors are dirty themselves so the fact that the tool has a solution and extra ports to clean up the cable i thought it was a nice little idea so definitely a useful device throw it in your bag your backpack a drawer always have it on hand and it comes in under 30 bucks thats why i said before possibly like a good you know gift idea for the holidays but uh maybe a good gift for someone else regardless of the holidays if youre feeling generous buy this for a friend next what if i told you there was a razer viper ultimate clone that was lighter slightly smaller and a third of the price meet the deluxe m800db this clone has exploded in popularity out there for that exact reason its pretty much a smaller viper ultimate you can see its nearly identical in shape but youre only paying 40 versus 120 inside the box it comes with a usbc charging cable a wireless dongle for and an extra pair of feet they are a stock teflon so decking this out with something like a nice hyper glides will definitely do the trick but my first impression of this just really blew me away because if you were blindfolded you would 100 think its a viper ultimate the only physical difference really is the dpi button is now on top instead of the bottom and there arent the right side buttons but there are still the buttons on the left side and we even have an rgb light strip with the butt now say what in terms of size its three millimeters shorter in length a three millimeter smaller at the grip width and two millimeters smaller at its hips but the height of the front flare in the top of the mouse is the same as the viper and it also comes in four grams lighter at just 70 grams versus 74 grams its not quite at the size of like the viper mini but hey i mean its still smaller and lighter than the viper ultimate the main difference really is going to come in with the wireless technology theyre using obviously razer is a multimillion probably billion dollar company and their wireless technology and sensor is admittedly going to be better and here we have a paw 3335 sensor that goes up to 16 000 dpi but the switches in these are kale 40 reds and they have a 60 million lifespan and all around the quality control here its really a solid mouse gaming with it since ive been mating the viper ultimate since release in 2019 i mean it when i say it like switching over to this it didnt feel like a difference at all this mouse is so on par with diaper ultimate for a fraction of the price that it is really just impressive thats the best way to say its impressive for 40 dollars so if you never wanted to deck out the money for the viper ultimate or youve wanted to really try it out but not you know take that plunge and m800db 40 bucks now moving right along you know me you know the channel you know this series you know what i like and i will never stop showing off cool macro pads dials knobs anything like that that could help people out in terms of macros and extra functions im telling you ill never stop no ragrets so meet the so meet the huion kd 100 keypad its wireless has 18 programmable keys plus a multifunctional dial up top and while it was made for their own like drawing tablets and stuff you dont need it its not required you can use this without a drawing tablet and set it to be a bunch of different macros functions and commands controls yes so with it being wireless it actually has a 100 hour battery life which is definitely pretty impressive you could also choose to use it wired because it has usb c port thank you but since it is so compact like a standard keypad that you would buy out there or people who buy like numpads and stuff the added functionality is really impressive so for the 18 programmable keys the actual keys themselves are like the scissor keys you would find on a laptop so its not going to be like a really satisfying like mechanical switch for example but honestly with something like this not too big of a deal but what i really like about the dial is it has these super satisfying clicks when you rotate it theres actually a button in the middle of the dial which lets you actually change up on the fly what the dial does so inside the software you can go in and really reprogram everything on here you can set each key to do things like a keyboard stroke a mouse click im running certain programs or system applications multimedia its all right there just very easily configurable and like i said before with the three different features built into the volume dial you have those same options available to you so itll say feature one through three you click on the one you want to change or adjust youll have those same options so you can make it do things like scrolling up and down or in and out of your timeline make it a volume wheel obviously for controlling like spotify and stuff your system audio so as i said before its only being advertised and sold along with like their drawing tablets and stuff but theres no telling you what you can or cant use this for photo editing video editing macros for gaming 3d design animation whatever you want have this wirelessly on your desk bunch of functions right at arms reach ill never stop showing off knobs macro pads keypads anything cool 50 bucks hell of a good deal then last but not least we have the genki shadow cast and this little hdmi device lets you use a laptop for example as like a monitor or at its own display to play and record games things like using your laptop to play your nintendo switch your xbox a ps5 really any hdmi device you can hook up to the shadow cast and now have it displayed or captured on your laptop or a pc really its essentially a more affordable elgato capture card instead of being 200 this little guy is just 50 they do have their own arcade software you can go in and download to do things like monitor your gameplay for capturing um but also you can just use like obs and thatll work just fine as well and just like any other capture card if you want you can use it with like a dslr and have it be like a webcam type thing so ill admit when i first saw this and picked it up i thought it turned any device into like a display not so much like a capture card like a passthrough device like this is but i just thought your laptop would be turned into a monitor which something you cant do you know uh but for being what it is again a much cheaper alternative to an elgato capture card out there 50 bucks versus 200 and ive showed off a lot of you know alternative capture cards in the past and hdmi capture cards like this uh so this one giving you a just another option out there to pick from for fifty dollars and theres like point two seconds of delay and stuff for capturing so again with a lot of your capture cards out there thats pretty standard to normal but again if you wanna find a quick and cheap way to rip your gameplay put it online genki shadowcast 50 bucks and guys ill wrap it up for this episode of cool tech under 50 for august hope you all

YINDdVBAP7o,the food crisis is getting worse,Food,ladies and gentlemen food scarcity globally is exploding at a rate that we havent seen in decades and no im not just talking about developing nations anymore although i will talk about that shortly in the video where we dont just have three or four food emergencies now we have more than a dozen food emergencies around the world not only that in western nations where typically weve always been fairly stable with food there are a lot of warnings coming out now not just from the government but also other organizations the united nations the world bank as well the ceo the the head guy should we say at the world bank has just done an interview talking about this crisis that is on the way with food ive been doing my own research over the last few days ive been tracking all sorts of things from inflation through to food banks through to food scarcity in western developed nations by income group by age group by state by country and it is very very alarming im going to show you a couple of these things today then so well just jump straight into it on the shared screen we now want to welcome david malpass president of the world bank welcome back to face the nation thank you very much theres also shortages theres inflation and and the food shortages for the poorer countries are becoming a significant concern they already are but youre also describing a recipe for global instability when theres not enough food that uh for for weaker countries poorer countries that that causes uh instability and its a big factor in the turnover of governments food crisis will be at least a threeyear problem the threeyear problem what time horizon do you put on the food crisis and the energy crisis the fertilizer isnt being made you know fertilizer comes a giant source of fertilizer is from natural gas through the ammonium channel and thats just not happening so a lot of the world is shutting down for lack of fertilizer and then those shortages of crops will last for multiple years are we at crisis were at crisis and we see more countries falling in one by one okay so there you have it right there this is the head of the world bank this is no longer um you know conspiracy or anything like that this this is these people politicians leaders talking about this on main stream media channels they are telling you now they are warning you and theyre warning everybody else that we are going to have food shortages now lets head over to the united states census bureau then and this is pretty alarming these are the states that have food insecurity or food scarcity at the moment and you can see this dark green area is growing and growing and growing and its not just the states that you would typically assume now were seeing even california were seeing texas were seeing a lot of other more wealthy states where there is food scarcity if you want to look any of this data up just head over to the censusgov and you can see all of this it is pretty concerning now what does all of this mean inflation means longer lines at food banks americans are turned into food banks for help in the face of rising food crisis some 55 of the 200 food banks in the feeding america network say donations of food are down at the same time pandemic relief programs including a river of government purchase food for distribution to the poor are winding down too im going to talk also about the uk and then were going to look at all the global issues here as well but lets just get into this first because it all ties together congress should increase mandatory annual funding for the emergency food assistance program tfap to 450 million dollars and earmark 200 million a year for distribution cost now of course there is push back on all this additional emergency funding etc but heres what i find uh ironic i guess we can say countries like the us and the uk and a lot of other wealthy nations they can find billions billions of dollars or pounds or euros is what its going to be for things like bombs and bullets to send to you know ukraine and the like and other war they can spend billions on war in fact trillions when you look at afghanistan iraq and some of the others but yet they cant find a hundred million or 200 million for a food program for their citizens that tells you that something is very very wrong in this world when we now operate at this sort of level this article is out of ohio in the us then fewer food donations are coming in because food is more expensive and the cost to purchase food to distribute is spiking as well so youve got a double hit here you have the cost of food going up and you have gasoline diesel other fuels for vehicles going up last year the food bank spent around 2 million on food to supplement donations they expect to spend at least double that this year just to keep up so you can see double that cost in ohio the state association of food banks is asking the governor for 183 million dollars in american rescue plan act funds to help hedge against the financial pressures food banks are facing all we can tell them is that were doing everything we can but its a heartbreaking situation when we know families are going hungry over to the uk then i pulled this data off the trussell trust this is a trust that i actually support and i would say to all of you really if you are in a fortunate position and you do have excess food or you have a large pantry that you rotate a lot and you do have some food that may be coming up to expire in the next few months um and you can spare food or you can spare funds i would definitely recommend helping out some of these food banks if it is within your budget because i can tell you how this is going to go this is only going to get worse and the governments although they have got all of this money for war and and other measures should we say when it comes to food historically when you look at the data and you look at history they dont often put in the money that is required to help to feed the hungry so thats why i mean personally i cant speak for you or what you should do but with any excess money that i have i definitely help out food banks so this is the trussel trust then in the united kingdom and you can see this it shows the number of emergency food parcels given by food banks in the trussel network between 21 and 22 and it is huge i mean the numbers that were given out and you can see this sort of spike here if we get in a little closer uh compared to this time five years ago the need for food banks in our network has increased by 81 i mean that is huge you can see how this was climbing even before we went into lockdowns over the last sort of year and a half two years and this is what happened during that period of 2020 to 21 this exploded so food bank usage exploded but you would expect with all the stimulus and all the money thats been produced that this would have come down past the the sort of this 19 million number here but no its still sat at 21 million so all you have to do you dont need all the data just look at the number when it comes to the food banks and that tells you how the economy is doing now up to 811 million people go to bed hungry every night the number of those facing acute food insecurity has more than doubled a total of 50 million people are facing emergency levels of hunger in 45 countries in just two years the number of severely food insecure people has increased by more than 200 million from 135mg so this is up to now 345 million people across 82 countries this is huge and what else are we seeing we saw sri lanka were also seeing ecuador now rising up a lot of other developing nations and whats happening in venezuela but this is how it ends up we wont watch the whole video here but this is what actually happens you get groups of starving people that just go on the rampage and theyll get whatever food they can that was a cow they were chasing there and you can probably guess how the video ends other news that weve just had out china northeastern black soil grain field is alarmingly depleted this is on top of their their failed harvest over the last year or two so its not looking good out of china either what else do we have we have ukraine is not looking good russia not exporting the way it was bbc news here food bills are set to soar by 380 pounds this year the cost of living crisis people cut back on food shopping as price rises bite nearly half of adults surveyed by the ons which is the office for national statistics of the united kingdom said they had bought less food in the past fortnight due to higher prices now i thought this was quite interesting how all these supermarkets keep saying that now let me read this out to you some shoppers are asking cashiers to stop scanning items when the till total hits 30 pounds as they try to cut costs and also switching to budget ranges that seems a strange number to me that all of these shoppers are coming in and saying oh when you get to 30 pounds just just stop what what what is this magic number 30 pounds it just seems very strange like it seems like preprogramming to me also switching to budget ranges well heres the thing if people are only you know got 30 pounds as a budget anyway they were probably already using budget ranges so this just seems very strange because i keep seeing this paragraph in all sorts of different media not just from one supermarket but multiple supermarkets saying the same thing it seems to me like this is some sort of preprogramming here many customers are buying it down particularly with food choosing value range items where they might previously have bought premium goods rising costs of groceries then you can see over the last year this is quite a good sort of interactive chart here shows you all the different prices uh poultry chicken duck yeah we know thats up more than 13 but i mentioned there are food crisis all around the world there afghanistan 228 million people the drc democratic republic of congo we have ethiopia 13 million people haiti a million people manma 144 million people northeastern nigeria 87 million people sahel 127 million somalia 6 million southern madagascar 147 million sudan more than 18 million i mean this is huge in in sudan south sudan under the 83 million syria 124 million and yemen again a big one up to 19 million people now the other thing that i find quite annoying at the moment is these messages coming out from the government saying that all of these greedy unions trade unions trying to the country because they want more money theyre asking for outrageous sums of money and all of this well some of them are only asking for a five percent pay rise some of them are asking for seven percent some for eight percent i mean it ranges theres a broad range at the moment of not just unions uh you know love or hate unions ill leave that to you but even the individual employees and were having politicians were having the bank of england governor and you know fed people at the fed and ecb coming out and saying some outrageous things like these employees are trying to be greedy and theyre trying to get too much money these unions are trying to get too much of a pay rise well hold on a moment why is it okay for these people that i just mentioned the government people and and the central bankers why is it okay for them to have pay rises right oh inflations so high we need to keep up our expenses we need why is it okay for them to have all these pay rises but now when regular people who need the pay rises for the inflation why is it now a big problem and why are they you know greedy for asking for pay rises to theyre not even asking for pay rises that meet inflation a lot of the time theyre just asking to offset a lot of that inflation whereas the people who dont need it these you know very wealthy people theyre the ones that its again again we are its a broken system now i know i keep saying this im like a broken record saying it but were living in a broken system where as i said earlier weve got billions for bombs and bullets and and everything else but we havent got millions for food for our own people we havent got money for our own soldiers who are homeless and on the street exmilitary but yet people come in from other countries and theyre given fourstar hotels it just doesnt make sense and this is why i keep saying im very worried about the world im very worried that were going into a huge collapse and i think its already started with everything over the last two years its now moving into the monetary side so a monetary collapse and also the food aspect as well were going to see a major issue with food as a result of fertilizer crop failures weather changes this is going to be severe its not going to end well my friends so thanks for watching today ill see you again tomorrow take care god bless
uLP4Mu-G6qU,wearable fashion trends 2022  what to wear spring summer,Fashion,wearable fashion trends for 2022 today ill be sharing your ultimate guide for what to wear this spring summer hi everyone welcome back to my channel and todays biannual deep dive into the most wearable fashion trends you should be wearing this season not only will i be sharing what the fashion trends are but where you can shop them right now without blowing the budget so sit back relax and let me take you on a little journey through the wonderful world of fashion for 2022 music lets kickstart these wearable fashion trends with probably the easiest one to recreate white on white on white head to toe brilliant white was seen from gabriela hurst the roe chloe and valentino and while its not exactly surprising for spring summer it is one of my favorite fashion trends for 2022 nothing says summer quite like being draped in crisp white dresses especially if were actually able to wear them on a sundrenched beach this year too fabricwise the world is your oyster choose from linen cottons flowing silks and satins but the key to making these outfits feel up to date would be the minimalism of the overall look now whether that means clean lines with an allwhite trouser suit floor sweeping white dresses or even adding a sprinkle of the cut out trend as well try and keep the essence timeless and sophisticated to really pull off this look perfectly designer wise i adore just about everything that johanna ortiz creates and i thought this a crew halter neck would be beautiful for summer max maras wide leg trousers would look stunning styled with maybe a similar toned shirt just loosely buttoned halfway down isabel morant brings a sprinkle of polish to the bohemian style and anaconds elegant simplicity with this satin bias cut dress more affordable now and mango keep it simple with gentle puff sleeves i love the styling of cozs classic shirt dress over trousers sleek and elegant it whistles and if youre quick theres a couple still in the sale at reese that i would happily add to basket the humble biker jacket theyve been a wardrobe staple for me for many years but theyre definitely back with a vengeance for 2022 from slouchy at balenciaga textured at acne studios classic at prada and i love the puff shoulders at todds shopping this trend my first port of call would be to go vintage theres obviously an authenticity to having a piece thats quite literally done the rounds and i personally really love when the leather feels a little bit more lived in mine was passed down to me by my mum i vividly remember her styling it with her skinny jeans and her wild 80s hair styling wise you could go all out naughties and pair with cut out creations or my personal favorite keep it simple and refined and let the jacket do the talking for you if youre in the market for a new one the most similar to mine would have to be this or for something a little bit different opt for camel suede instead all saints always have a brilliant selection i also love this sustainable option from deadwood saint laurent naturally bring that authentic rock chick vibe and take two trends at once at nanushka h m tend to sell out quick but their affordable selection are often worth snapping up and though i dont usually shop there asos can be surprisingly good when it comes to biker jackets dont forget to let me know your favorite fashion trends as we go along in the comment section below its always really lovely to hear from you all it would honestly be easier to tell you who wasnt sharing some variation of the miniskirt for spring summer these minuscule little numbers were one of the hottest trends to hit almost every single runway its definitely the season to show off your legs im honestly squirming at the thought i dont like my legs and i probably never will but as david quite rightly points out what have they ever done to you aside from support you so im thinking i might push myself out of my comfort zone and at least have a little dabble in this trend it was actually a trend that was kind of bubbling in the background last season but this year theres definitely no escaping it so i set my sights on finding a selection of lovely examples that wouldnt fill me with dread for nights out i actually really love this version by dodo bar or its tiny i know but i love the extra punch with those sequins going my high street now and h m always have and the odd one or two particularly handy if you dont want to overspend on the trend i bought this faux leather one a month or so ago its short but not ridiculously so though i would advise sizing down if you like it too as is a little bit big around the waist coles always hit the right note with their mini skirts and theres actually quite a few i would be more than happy to wear from and other stories i know initially this fashion trend can feel a little bit daunting but styled in an elegant or minimalist fashion i actually feel more comfortable than i first thought i would with all of these trends ive added my favorites in the description box below i will also keep updating this list too as more and more of these trends filter through to the high street so it might be worth saving this video to refer back to when you are shopping definitely worth a little try out trends i wont be indulging in interlude a quick fire round of the 2022 fashion trends i shall be swerving this year never have i ever and im not about to start now it is a big fashion trend that we saw all over the catwalk but it is so fluffy to wear they get stuck in your hair they can get caught in your toggles and dont even try and go to the loo in them though i do adore this sheer and sparkly full length number from kate i cant imagine anywhere that i could possibly wear it though i really hate to pin any trend on a certain age category i think i should be leaving the short sheer and sexy looks to the youth with this one i think unless you have very naturally thin legs gladiator sandals and all the masses of straps that go round and round and round your legs seem to just accentuate all my bulgy bits then to make matters worse they do it all the way up my legs i should add a side note to this one i will partake but only in the most subtle versions that i can find i am nowhere near toned enough to bear my midriff my shoulders maybe half a leg all at the same time but if you are then please do go ahead and rock this trend for me instead all those big gaudy labels everywhere just feels a little bit bling a little bit look at me and for all the wrong reasons i just dislike them immensely im so sorry if you wear them and you really like them theyre just really not for me back to the 2022 fashion trends i will be investing in and one thats a great alternative if the idea of those micro minis fills you with dread the fulllength tube dress now maxis rather than midi lengths will be reigning supreme this season but while past seasons saurus embrace our inner bohemian spirit this year maxis should be a little more structured think clean straight lines tapering neatly to your ankles in the late 90s early naughties fashion and youll be on the right track keep it ultra simple in jonathan simkais cotton jersey dress tube dress perfection at lulus studio cos naturally have this very minimalistic style which i just love and arquette always bring a really affordable but high quality version of the trends oversized structured blazers will be worn over just about everything this season and sometimes over nothing at all givenchy added crop tops mewmu went for leather altizara opted for color and saint laurent focused on sharp shoulders with nothing underneath but really looking at those trends and interpreting them for a genuinely wearable wardrobe the key points were oversized and polished aside from that what i really love about this trend was that spirit of anything goes choose a blazer in a pop of pink and layer it over a sheerish dress mix in the micro mini or maybe the puffball trend for added drama or just keep things super simple in a late 90s minimalist fashion and style with tailored but wide leg trousers instead this is probably the style that i will opt for most certainly as an everyday look its easy both in its creation and aesthetic and while it gives a nod to the big blazer trend all those individual pieces are really timeless for my wardrobe this is one fashion trend thats actually been around for quite a while now its just that this year its become a little bit more exaggerated so i wouldnt worry about investing in this one i think it will be around for a long while yet if the naughtiest revival or late 90s minimalism isnt for you dont panic as theres another dress trend to reach for this season seen by the likes of celine louisvey zimmerman and simone russia puff shapes were definitely making a comeback though its a trend thats been building slowly on the high street heres a few examples that i found so far carls have had both a dress and a skirt in this style recently but im imagining that the skirt would actually become the most versatile in your wardrobe coast took both the cut out and the puff trend boxes with their little black dress and i love the minimal elegance with this alternative from a brand called ellia zimmermann brought the essence of roman holiday to their spring summer collection and there was definitely a feminine take on the puffball trend running through it which i just love beautiful audrey hepburnesque floral dresses made from silks and organza nipped in waists and full skirts it was dreamy romantic and actually hugely wearable it feels like the highwaisted denim trend has gone on forever i only just found a couple of pairs that i thought i looked half decent in and alas its gone out of fashion low rise lovers rejoice youre back in the game seen on the runway from the likes of tom ford msgm and zimmerman to name but a few like the mini skirt trend i would say low slung denim jeans will be one of the key trends for spring summer 2022 so its really worth finding a favorite pair that suit your body shape for ultimate fashionista points style yours in a y2k fashion think midriff bearing cardis in bubblegum tones and grecian draping tops with a heavy dollop of jlo sass personally though i will be taking a more minimal and elegant approach to the trend and ill be looking out for pieces that will tick the box but hopefully last a lifetime in my wardrobe i really like frame denims interpretation and reys low slung and baggy boyfriend jeans hit all the right notes on the more affordable front asos have a low waisted straight leg version retailing at 35 pounds and h m also have a couple of pairs that wont break the bank while i dont think highwaisted jeans are going out of fashion as such there is a definite shift to a lower waist all round in 2022 so whether you interpret that in trousers with skirts or in straight boot cut or wide leg jeans its up to you but youll probably find it handy having some version of it in your wardrobe this season we saw a lot of daytime sparkles sequins and glitzy style embellishments on the runway this season perhaps its a result of spending the best part of two years in our houses designers want us out out again and doing it very loud and proud i love the juxtaposition of a sequin skirt and a simple tshirt but the reality for me is my lack of places to wear such a lovely outfit combo new years resolution i must get out more on the flip side of sparkles enter the stripes a trend that im always happy to invest in due to its really timeless quality balmain molly goddard louis vuitton and fendi sent an array of bold stripes down the catwalk and i would happily wear any of them in one way or another but sadly my budget doesnt really stretch to a whole well main dress maybe i could afford like one sleeve but not a lot else so i will be searching the high street for ways that i could interpret this trend within my own budget i like the candy colored block stripes at oasis and the boxy fit bretons are cos lemlem always do the prettiest summer dresses and their signature bold stripes really fit the bill perfectly bowden two always love a stripe so they would be a great place to look for this trend keep it simple with a striped top or maybe a spring jumper or go with a bold chevron look like this code i found from wells bonner norma kamalis figure hugging striped panel dress feels an elegant but bold way to really rock this trend and although sadly out of my budget again but how stunning is this emporio syringes set its early on in the season but blink and the high street will be full to the brim of different options on this trend dont forget to keep an eye on the description box below that i shall keep updating over the coming months as and when new stock comes in store with the high street head to toe color might be the perfect antidote to your all white outfits this spring summer and with the likes of alexander mcqueen christian serrano valentino versace and tom ford joining in theres certainly enough inspiration to be had from neon pink to coral sunshine yellow to purples it did feel a little bit like the actual tone doesnt really matter its how you style it that counts and head to toe color blocking would definitely be where its at for example think about matching blazers and tailored trousers in a pop of color rather than always in neutral reminding myself of that one or keep your eye out for coords that are definitely still around for another season thats often an easy way to find a matching set of color underdog trend gaining traction this season would be bootcut jeans which i for one am particularly chuffed about as they give the illusion of much longer legs it wasnt just jennifer allisons hair we all championed back in the 90s her bootcut jeans became a massive hit worldwide too and its that spirit complete with spaghetti strap tops and platform shoes that well be seeing everywhere for 2022 pretty much every big name jeans brand already has a version of this trend but theres a few standouts that are definitely worth a mention i love the vintage wash to this pair from mother or go for classic with citizens of humanity these are definitely my cup of tea with organic cotton from rey or go for dark indigo shade i like these ones from seven for all mankind h m bring a higher waist version and chic for less at new look who have options in blue and black in 2021 we saw a huge rise in the number of websites offering rental fashion and its definitely something i think we will continue to see in popularity throughout 2022 with websites like her collective retaro and my wardrobe hq the allure of it is obvious for a fraction of the price we can all wear that dress to an event that would otherwise have been out of reach for example you could rent this rose printed dolce gabbana dress for just 147 pounds for the day or a classic little black dress from victoria beckham for just 20 pounds a day many of these websites are already linked up with a couple of stores like harrods but im imagining that trend will expand even more this year itd be great when we get to the stage when all the stores offer the choice of either renting or buying their new collections and resale collections directly on a brands website would be perfect and hugely sustainable too theyre probably not much of a money spinner for the brands themselves im hoping to do more rental fashion this year certainly for those more dressed up occasions so i shall keep you updated on that one who are the easiest websites to order from when it comes to shoes ive seen a few different trends being thrown about for this season but the one that i think will really stick would be platforms the late 90s trend thats going to be hard to avoid in 2022 from platform brogues at prada to the highest of heights at valentino its definitely the season for gaining at least a couple of inches in height and i for one am very happy about this i remember having various pairs of platforms when i was younger even my school shoes had a fair old wedge on them yes i did get told off an awful lot for wearing them at school but i still wore them anyway so its fair to say i have a lot of nostalgia going on when it comes to this trend but i actually find them surprisingly comfortable to wear as well i will probably end up going for some sort of platform brogue like these i spotted at cos and i like the original ones at doc martens 2 on the heels front i think youll have the pick of the bunch from the high street stores come the height of summer but for now its mainly the designers that are sporting this new look trainers got a little bit of height too from the likes of adidas and isabel marantz to name but a few and sandals will stay pretty similar as last year but with that added bit of height bringing them more up to date for this season as youve probably gathered throughout this video one of the key points for looking really on trend this spring summer would be to channel a bit of 90s minimalism designerwise jill sanders brings to mind having had this aesthetic for many years but hopefully youve seen throughout this video that the high street can be really adept at mirroring what we see on the catwalk ill be a little bit later down the line white dresses with platform sandals layered with big blazers to finish or minis straight maxis and stripes all hit the mark and if youre wanting to opt for colour go all out and do it head to toe low waisted trousers or maybe a boot cut paired with your platform shoes and a giant tote to finish and youll be rocking 2022 like a seasoned fashionista what fun were going to have styling that lot this year i for one cannot wait dont forget to let me know your favorite trends in the comments section below

nUZCE40n2zg,i ate gordon ramsays food for an entire day,Food,only eat gordon ramsays food for an entire day strange requests but im down lets do it but first if you didnt know were gaining on gordon so if youre watching right now and not a subscriber go hit that button below now there are a few options for the task at hand today the first is i somehow convinced gordon to be my private chef for the day considering hes probably the most famous chef in the world thats not gonna happen but it turns out he has quite a few restaurants in las vegas hells kitchen ever heard of it but i have one problem my cameraman manny isnt allowed in vegas after being counting cards on multiple occasions hopefully that wont be an issue because were going anyways weve arrived at caesars palace but manny and i want to do a grand entrance music seven knife also have a question is this the real caesars power what do you mean its easier here right now no oh this is where were gonna be spending the night were greeted by this crazy little room at the entrance which kind of has a cool echo and as we walk back this is all for me and then music i mean this place is just insane what the are you doing wait a second i dont know what the just happened its time for bed well see you in the morning for a lot of food hey look at this spot im gonna press dangerous hey caesar did he invent the caesar salad so first restaurant were hitting for breakfast is gordon ramsay burger zane here i guess we could call you our handler for the day because mannys been acting up it became quickly clear to me that gordon ramsay burger just basically had a bunch of fancy hamburger and im definitely not complaining they also let me work the girl in the back for a little bit if this was secretly a test by gordon im pretty sure i nailed it so we are here at breakfast i guess you could kind of call it a lunch because its about 10 30 in the morning and we are gonna be eating the entire day first up we have this scramble sandwich which basically looks to be gordons famous scrambled egg there we are the perfect scrambled egg nestled in some buttery brioche bun hey that is really good over here we have these bacon bit tater tots yummy and then something that i am very excited for personally his sticky toffee pudding french toast which im going to dip in both sauces oh manny that is good oh now we have our breakfast drink because of course were going to have a lot of cocktails today and this is called the oh bloody hell minnie i think we might see tipsy nick today after trying everything it was time to let manny have abbott i told him to pace himself for the day but he didnt really listen were gonna have to roll manny out in a wheelchair i cant drive there the winning starts in three and a half hours so that was a fantastic breakfast my favorite was easily the scrambled sandwich gordon is known for his scrambled eggs next up we have gordon ramsay fish and chips early lunch gordon ramsay fish and chips is clearly one of those spots that gordon brought back from home and i think its awesome that he brought a restaurant like this to the us what the are you doing its good so first up we have this lobster fish and chips and i will say it smells fantastic im going to give it a nice squeeze of lemon then dip it into some oh shoot then dip it into both sausage and crunch next up we have classic fish and chips sandwich with this curried sauce this sauce right here is basically a really good curried mayonnaise and my guess is that its something classic for fish and chips in the uk and i love it its something ive never had before but its delicious the last bite here is a biscoff milkshake everyone knows those cookies they give you on planes and im going to dive in easily my favorite thing there was that curried sauce benji can you check on the screen if thats traditional because im super curious but next where are we going were going to gordon ramsay pub what is that mix like me and you so before we head to the next restaurant we have a little surprise the roof scene from the hangover manny and i are going to recreate it music next we pulled up to gordon ramsay pub ill be honest im not the biggest fan of beer because for some reason it really hurts my stomach nerd but ive never been opposed to good old bar food and thats exactly what gordon ramsay pubs seems to be here we naturally had to get some traditional pub food first off im going to dive into the short rib grilled cheese which i have to say looks delicious i may dip it in just a little bit of mustard and then next up these are called the hellfire wings now just by the name that sounds pretty spicy and we all know my heat tolerance is not very good drums are still better than wings yummy thats basically barbecue sauce with maybe a little bit of hot sauce in there you would all be very proud of me to know that my heat tolerance has gone up i can handle this last but not least this is quite creative we have kettle chip nachos im having a lot of cheese today man im gonna need that lactose bill the thing about bar food is you usually think of it like pizza or nachos but they make really creative takes on all that stuff this is french onion soup made with ale pretty clever were gonna get as many stinky toffee puddings as we can today so here comes our first bite the best way i can describe this if youve never had it before is basically a really soft fluffy caramel flavored brownie with vanilla ice cream and hot caramel delicious we are now here in front of probably the most famous restaurant in gordon ramsays entire empire hells kitchen and i am very excited to see whats behind those doors lets go of all of gordon ramsays restaurants throughout the world hells kitchen has to be the most famous iphone i mean who doesnt know hells kitchen this place is crazy we are in hells kitchen and naturally lots of amazing tv moments have happened here lets watch a couple lets go step outside youre not a cook either wheres the lamb sauce we wasted the most expensive ha from the show here answered scallops if you potate scallops in a nonstick pan they wont stick thats why its called nonstick and lobster risotto are the signature appetizers some of my other favorites though from the crispy skin salmon which has been on every season of the show as well i really love all the details here even down to the little things on top of the drinks they have the whole theme nailed down in here hello welcome to hells kitchen las vegas my name is manny hold on wait a second im in youre manny im manny im in too many minutes in this place all right i need to get out of here so first things first were gonna have some lobster risotto the lobster is super tender and the risotto is just ultra creamy delicious next they have a foie gras which is a duck lip ive never seen a macaron on something like this i love foie gras and this right here is the perfect bite first things first we need to make sure the crispy skin salmon has actual crispy skin in fact i remember cooking lots and lots of crispy skin salmon for gourd at a nascar speedway and he was pretty harsh on me for that listen that was delicious but very very hot last but not least we have to make the perfect bite for these scallops oh i  it up one big bite maybe here you guys have our sticky toffee pudding here we have our triple weight coconut sorbet here with passion fruit puree coconut cream the coconut ice cream looks awesome it also looks like its in a fresh cracked coconut and you guys know how much i love edible flowers this is our second sticky toffee pudding of the day lets see how it compares if im being totally honest the sticky toffee bunny in the other place was a little bit hotter and a little bit fluffier but its still delicious we have finished up our meal at hells kitchen and it was hey nick what have you got a message for you what are you im gonna be in sandwich what are you an idiot sandwich our experience in hells kitchen was awesome but were headed to the final meal of the evening its dinner time and we get to try the beef wellington at gordon ramsay steak once we finally reached our last stop at gordon ramsay steak we went through this cool tunnel that represented the tunnel i loved all the decorations throughout the restaurant it was very gordon inspired and we even got a quick tour through the kitchen im always surprised when people got manny in the kitchen hes such a liability we are finally here at dinner at our last restaurant of the day and not right there on the wall that beef oiling dinner is a preview of whats to come tonight for the start of dinner we have the farmers market salad then we have one of my alltime favorites the foie gras which we also tasted earlier but this one is totally different and i always like to say you have to get the wellrounded bite with a little bit of everything on the plate vodka is just so incredibly rich fatty and its always great when its cut with something acidic like orange because oftentimes acidity and fat go super super well together they balance each other out just like me and man so here we have our large selfish platter for you this evening i love myself a good seafood platter im gonna try a little bit of everything first im gonna try this big  piece of king crab it looks nice and fresh look at this shrimp oh that was good mannys living large today lets do some oysters through this  lemon little lemon in here mmm fresh is good all right check this out we got a little bit of like hot sauce right here im gonna put some of this on the moisture keep doing youre fired get out im not sure what manny just said to you about the seafood tower im gonna kindly advise you dont listen to any of it with that said i love a good seafood tower however my one complaint can often be that if things are directly touching the ice they get super cold and hard to bite through so my advice to any of you ever making a seafood tower is make sure theres something separating the seafood from the actual ice this thing right here though im excited to eat this im a big fan of crudo and this here is a hamachi crudo i can see its got a pretty big chili or pepper on the top and again im trying to up my spice tolerance a little bit lets see how spicy it depends how you bite down in the pepper and how the pepper hits your tongue sometimes my strategy for spicy stuff is to not bite too much into the pepper and swallow it and then just my stomach hurts not my mouth naturally we are all very excited for the beef wellington and its also got a fat piece of lobster tail on top which is even better i feel like theres a little bit of black truffle on the top of that and frankly having that lobster and the beef wellington together is super decadent im gonna rate this meatballington over the beef wellington that we had at ramsays kitchen back in boston when gordon challenged me to bring it on bring it on big boy next up we got our tomahawk and i can smell from this thing that its dry aged it dries this for about a month and the entire flavor profile and smell of the whole thing changes based on that im gonna eat this tomahawk the best way you can eat any tama right off the boat and you want a bite yeah thats really good before our final dish our final dessert of the day the sticky toffee pudding for the third time in a row lets have a little bit of that smoky chipotle mac and cheese because this is our third and final sticky toffee pudding of the day theyre gonna let me do the honors and pour on that beautiful sauce oh look at that and this is brown butter ice cream in the shape of a stick of butter well go ahead and well place that right on top beautiful and a little bit more of that sauce perfect the final bite of the day i dont even know how many dishes weve had today but im sure we can put a count right in the bottom of the screen here the sticky toffee pudding weve had three today so im also really just curious to see which one wins i think on both taste and presentation we have to give this one the win especially with that stick of butter thats in the flavor of brown butter ice cream brown butter is probably one of my favorite things out there its time for manny to try a bite honestly thats the best by the way music hello are you maddie i got a tip from the guy upstairs youve been counting cars you got to go youre out of here ill see you later
EaRhaLhhakw,apple calls this pro,Tech, oh you would love to hear some tech news right now wouldnt you youre all about tech youre weird youre such a wacky and fun person i love that apple shocked the world with their first m1 macbooks i mean they were armpowered laptops that outperformed nearly anything in their weight class but apple doesnt seem too worried about what people think of the new m2powered 13 inch macbook pro its the sequel curse its everywhere youtubers max tech and created tech no relation have found that the ssd in the baselevel m2 macbook pro performs as much as 50 slower than its m1 predecessor but hey playing devils advocate here the number next to the m went up by a 100 so trade offs at least part of the explanation seems to involve apple using a single nand chip instead of multiple chips potentially as a result of the global chip shortage the other possibility is that apple is just trying to make people ask themselves why theyre buying the base model of the fancy pro laptops so you can tell people its a pro it makes about as much sense as paying 50 for a burger its a burger yeah come at me foodies if you really wanna spend your money on an m2 chip asap

eBSeCp__xhI,focus on yourself not others  best motivational speech 2022,Motivation,today i need you to embrace what comes hard to day i need you to accept the challenge  today i need you to fall in love with the process  there will be plenty of opportunities to get discouraged  to lose your passion  and think that its not meant to be but if youre going to reach your destiny  you have to have a madeup mind if you give up after the first time  or the fifth time or the 30th time  what that really means is you didnt want it bad enough there should be something youre believing for that you are relentless you are not moved by how impossible it looks  youre not discouraged by how long its taking  you dont give up because people told you no youre attitude is  if i have to believe my whole life  i am not going to stop believing  i am not going to take no for an answer  im not going to settle for mediocrity  im going to keep pursuing   what put in my heart and ask ourself what do i really want what do i really want and write it down writing causes thinking thinking creates an image and you get these images  and you get this images growing  your building a vision in your mind its the visionaries thats changed the world think of that but what keeps that competitive edge what keeps you on top is the ability to think  and prepare mentally over and over and over again the body has limitations the mind does not we focus so much  on what goes on the neck down that we forget it all starts from here everything starts from there if youre not mentally ready  youre never really physically prepared and thats where the preparation starts what would your life be like  as you look toward the future if you decided im not going to allow my fears to stop me and im saying to you whatever you gotta do do it because if your dont life is gonna whoop you until you surrender so when youre young and you make mistakes dont let em eat you up cause everybody that done made it done made em you got to fail in order to win hey look man to understand how to hit the game when its shot you got to miss the game when its shot you know you got to be tough because  the road to success is always under construction its never a clear path to success the people who become successful are the people who have a relentless attitude and you just got to hang in there through the bad breaks cause the bad breaks is comin but they usually come right before the big break is about to happen you get a series of bad breaks and it stumbles up a lot of people my life and my success is to say to anyone you can stumble you can fall you can get back up again
-EZ_3Tq9a8c,dope tech weirdest earbuds ive ever tried,Tech, all right whats up im marques here welcome back to dope tech and yes this is an xbox series s fully portable in the shape of a laptop with a display on it and everything this is sent to be by the creators of the xscreen and for a certain group of people this is really cool so obviously handheld gamings having a bit of a moment right now i am also currently testing this little guy called the valve steam deck you might have heard about it leave a thumbsup if youre excited for that video but this thing well this is exactly what it looks like its called the xscreen for xbox series s and it basically turns the console into a laptop form factor for you hardcore gamers that wanna play xbox games but not just on the couch so basically all you have to do is plug it in by connecting this piece to the xbox like a puzzle piece it has a usb plug and an hdmi plug in the back and you plug them in to align the whole thing up and theres two bonus little thumbscrews one on either side to help hold everything in place and then you use literally the original cable that came with the xbox and then boom the whole thing can light up just like this the screen turns on and youre gamin on the go now this screen its not the highest end screen in the world on paper like the numbers its an 116inch diagonal screen and its 1080p its an ips at 60hz right but it matches the size of the xbox obviously to achieve this form factor and then if you think about it 1080p right so that this screen you might be already gaming on for a console like this is 1080p but this is obviously way smaller so its actually significantly sharper the higher pixel density and so you can sit much closer to it like i am here and so its really just about convenience to match the size of the xbox its got the stereo speakers up top it also has an optional stand mode to help you get a better angle and its got a crosshair mode to help you better aim in shooter games if youre into that you basically just have to plug it in and light it up and it starts gaming so yeah its not a 4k or 120hz screen or anything like that but i wasnt really expecting that much from something that plugs directly into an xbox and you know what it still does have this nice matte finish which makes it easy to see in a variety of lighting situations it might face the audio gets surprisingly loud honestly its easy to have a lot of fun playing this almost anywhere that you could fit a normal or super thick gaming laptop well except for the fact that you do pretty much always need to be plugged in i did see a video on the creators youtube channel where they have this massive 99watthour battery and so you could in theory bring it and the battery on a flight you know get that seat back tray table goin but it lasts about 40 minutes so if you have the seat on a plane with no outlet this isnt exactly great but overall you know aside from the rear usb and ethernet ports being blocked and the white color not quite exactly matching up the same as the xbox plastic but being really close this thing is really well built and its 250 bucks for the whole kit so its on kickstarter right now thats basically the same price as the xbox series s is going for its a little bit pricey but ill say if you have the outlet in the back of your car and you want to play xbox games on the go like this is yeah this is the best way to actually do that until maybe of course tesla finally ships that gaming feature theyve been promising for so long so overall im gonna give this seven out of 10 if its actually shipping and people are playing xbox games on the go thats pretty dope all right these might be the strangest but coolest earbuds design ive ever seen these are called sony linkbuds theyre brand new you might have seen me tweet about them the other day and right away you can tell theyre pretty different from normal earbuds youre seeing things correctly the earbud is a circle the part that actually goes into your ear is a circle ill explain so a lotta headphones we use right now have active noise cancellation but then a separate feature that they started adding more and more often which is some sort of transparency mode so it uses the microphones around the earbud to pump in sound from the outside so you can walk around on the streets and still hear the cars around you or hear when your bus or train stop gets called so these well these are designed so you can always hear your environment around you even when youre wearing them so they have an 11millimeter circular driver and a hole in the middle so when you put the earbuds in without playing any music you can still hear a lot of the outside world around you then when you play music well yeah it sounds like the headphones are on with the transparency mode now i found its not actually as good as say airpods pro because those microphones are actually amplifying your environment so with these if theres music playing you still hear a little bit of whats around you but you can actually drown it out if you turn the volume up loud enough but i really have been impressed with how well these actually work i mean clearly the physics makes sense theres a hole through it but yeah now youre letting in constantly a nonadjustable amount of sound from the outside world so its great for listening to music while cars are around you or on public transportation so you can still hear when your bus stop gets called or something like that its consistent so then the idea with these is even when youre done using them done listening to music or taking a phone call or whatever it is youre doing you can just leave them in your ears because youll have transparency mode youll have the ability to hear whats going on around you all the time even when the earbuds are in and it doesnt take extra battery power to do that so now youre just having a normal conversation now the other thing you may have noticed is these earbuds are pretty tiny like the buds themselves are very small and the recycled plastic case they fit in as a result is also very pocketable but the down side is that theres no space on the buds themselves for media controls anywhere but thats where the second crazy feature comes into play you can adjust volume by tapping the skin around your ears so the sony connect app lets you program a doubletap or a tripletap of your own skull on the right or lefthand side and these earbuds are sensitive enough of their own position that you can map a doubletap on the righthand side to be volume a doubletap on the lefthand side could be skipping tracks or even opening google assistant or accepting a phone call its awesome overall as crazy as these are they are surprisingy usable theyre 179 bucks small case no wireless charging but it does have usb type c and it gives you a fivehour total battery life with these sound quality is solid if anything its lacking a little bit of bass cause its not getting into your ear like normal earbuds might but yeah if you can get the touch controls to work well theyre finicky sometimes so you gotta tap like right up next to your ear theyre pretty cool im gonna give these an eight outta 10 okay this next product i know is absolutely not meant for me but i can still inspect it anyway this is a super high end gaming tablet and i just need you to know that this is real and this is something that actually exists so this is the asus rog flow z13 this thing has an up to 14core intel core i9 processor a geforce rtx 3050ti graphics card a 1080p 120hz display or a 4k 60hz option up to one terabyte of m2 ssd storage and a vapor chamber cooling solution on the back so yes its a fullfledged gaming computer running windows you can think of it kinda like a surface pro but just way more gaming focused now i cant imagine battery life will be killer on something like this most of the time but hey gaming laptops dont typically have amazing battery life either so thats not a huge surprise im really into this design though the aesthetics of how they managed to shove all that power into a tabletsize package its got some thickness to it of course and its definitely not lightweight but its a reasonable layout theres a power button and volume rockers on the right side along with a combo microphone headphone jack and a speaker at the bottom and then theres a single usb type c thunderbolt port on the left side along with this labeled xgm port which is gonna let you plug in different external gpus theres pins and magnets at the bottom for docking a keyboard accessory just like the surface and theres no ports up top but just heat dissipation just heat sinks heat radiating out the top and look at that leds pcb and the angular cutout and a kickstand that is a really nice touch and im not just saying that cause its red and black although that certainly helps but theyve made as many clever incisions for ventilation and angular gamer aesthetic as possible and they seem to have gotten away with it now the 3050ti isnt the highest end graphics card in the world i get that if you wanna play the witcher 3 or cyberpunk or something like that on high settings youre gonna need more power probably something in a laptop form factor but thats why this thing can plug into those external gpu attachments the same stuff that the rog flow thin and light laptop could plug into cause this is meant to actually game on you should definitely dave2ds full video on it he gets 120 fps on this tablet in overwatch its a tablet its hilarious ill link it below so the thing is a tablet when you want it to be but can plug into this rog xg mobile graphics dock which gives you up to an rtx 3080 basically youre buying a gaming laptop in two parts if that makes sense but i keep coming back to everything i like about just the back of this tablet the subtle texture of the metal the rocksolid stand with this window cutout and under the kickstand theres a bunch of outlines giving you a peek at whats inside so the m2 ssd the battery and of course an opening to a micro sd card slot theres also a set of coordinates on the back which if you google them appears to direct you to asus headquarters in taiwan best part though they still included the camera on the back cause somewhere out there theres somebody who would spend a bunch of money there isnt even a price for this thing yet but a bunch of money probably on a super high end gaming tablet but still would take pictures with it anyway im giving this thing like a nine outta 10 just for the aesthetic im a huge fan but then the last thing i wanna mention this usbc power cable with the display readout on the end has been awesome so basically ever since i showed it in my everyday carry video ive been carrying it and its lowkey just like nerdy fun to just be able to plug in and see exactly what sort of wattage youre getting from your charger on any device you know we always talked about peak charging versus actually overall average charging rates and this is so obviously unnecessary and overkill but being able to see exactly what type of power youre drawing at any given moment maybe its 30 watts maybe its 22 maybe its your laptop youre pulling over 100 from low battery i dunno its just so entertaining now the thing about this every time i link it anywhere it sells out so im tryin to do my best to keep an updated link in the description for wherever i can find it in stock ill do that again with this video but no promises if you want this youll probably

Y53hOrNU1u0,nightmare egypt food tour police shut us down,Food,um egypts slogan should be leave your camera at home but bring your money they dont want you to shoot here thats very obvious very clear egypt its one of the worst countries in the world for filmmakers i wouldnt suggest it for tourists either within hours of arriving in cairo my team and i were interrogated and searched finally all of our equipment was confiscated its very dehumanizing at this point because theyre going through my personal items picking stuff up or telling me to pick stuff up and then saying what is this its a back roller why do you need this why do i need this how about go    so all this for the crime of wanting to film ford in egypt with a valid shooting permit now with only iphones in hand the show must go on were gonna go into the back and see what few people have seen before lets go were hitting the streets of cairo in search of any food vendors who will have us this is where the action really happens so many raw ingredients is beautiful but even this low profile shooting wont be enough to evade this countrys overzealous militaristic police force right now the van is at a police station theyve gone through the shots on my phone we dont know whats going to happen next its possible theyll try to delete the footage so what did i film that was so egregious the police demanded i delete it ill show you right after breakfast as the first rays of light pierced through the trees and old dust cape buildings of cairo a small window of peace gradually fades away replaced by the hustle and bustle of city life cars motorbikes bicycles and the occasional horse or donkey populate the streets crowds are massive and move like schools of fish with a beautiful chaos like no place ive seen before music let me be clear i like this city it has character on camera it looks amazing however i dont like and i dont respect the people who run it day one location one our conniving and mostly useless local producer has brought us here a small streetside eatery on a quiet road low traffic means a lower chance of suspicious police or quickly forming mobs sounds great but whats on the menu music we are in the kitchen of our first location and im excited because i dont know what people in egypt eat for breakfast but right now im getting a little bit of a hint behind me he is frying french fries and he just made falafel too the falafel here is made with fava beets and then fried until they look like little hockey puffs for now im going to go to the serving area where they have so much food and im going to decide what were going to eat officially for breakfast today lets go this is saad alharabi a restaurant named after its owner mr assad specializes in dishes that use fava beans fava beans are a common breakfast here in cairo with over 40 years of experience sod can mix and match flavors in over 50 ways hello sir good morning hes really busy right now here he has about 15 different dishes and tons of flavor combinations so people come they step up they order and then hes kind of the main guy making it happen someone just ordered a chip sandwich another chip sandwich i should get one of those oh so now hes not busy hey we connected after all oh my god see it just takes persistence so right now hes gonna make me a chip sandwich hes got the soft bread here puts in the chips some salt and then this is a white sauce im not sure what that is yet he puts in some salad some greens carrots a little bit of cabbage in there can this be the plate please yes yes and he wont give it to me at all i promise ill pay music crunchy theres something delectable about putting a soft carbohydrate with a crunchy chips i dont know if you guys were poor like me but when i grew up i would just make a potato chip sandwich with ketchup or with butter and so it takes me back to those days to the days of my impoverished youth most of flavor is coming from the salt he added and the tahini tahini is kind of new for me i dont know if ive had that before tahini its an arabic condiment made from toasted ground whole sesame seeds made into a paste here youll see it join most meals the tahini its saltine a bit of sweet sourness i dont know i need to try that more to kind of pin it down the bread is excellent its soft its chewy its a great little treat before you eat your actual breakfast which were gonna do next aside from chip sandwiches they have something called food the food is something that is eaten commonly for breakfast here all throughout the city of cairo and what it is its fava beans applause fava beans are one of the oldest cultivated plants with evidence of their incorporation into egyptian diets dating back to at least 6000 bc now in day theyre a staple in egypt used in dishes like fool and falafel a soupy dish made with stewed fava beans salt and pepper corn oil tahini and chili sauce it kind of looks like refried beans in a way but it probably tastes different because it has spices in there too falafel a bean cake made with fava beans spices garlic and herbs roll it into balls and deep fry this is a kind of a typical egyptian breakfast something you might expect to see in the morning here in cairo and its beautiful theres a huge selection people probably wouldnt order as many things but i have lets take a look at these i mentioned french fries for breakfast i cant say that this is rare im looking around i see almost everybody here has ordered the french fries here this is falafel im going to break that open oh very nice looking extra crispy fried and delicious as far as i know its something to be eaten with anything im just going to try plain like this lets go for it super crunchy and pretty airy too falafels not always my favorite sometimes i find falafel can be really dry but here this is one of my top pull off ones ive ever had i think because theyre using a different type of bean its much more airy and light and its not just like a thick big chunk of fried stuff the main reason i came here is for this this is called fool and this is a very common breakfast that youll see in cairo you cant really eat it with your hands its not really a spoon provided you kind of laugh it up with the bread right here this bread is super famous here in cairo its called egyptian bread and i want to go right now to see how its made and then we get teleported behind me now an egyptian bread bakery you can see from the front the fresh bread coming out people buying it over here but were gonna go into the back and see what few people have seen before lets go music here its a very tight fit its enough space for the ingredients and the oven thats basically all thats here in the back room you can see theyre making the flour theyre making the dough made with a simple recipe this is the backbone of egyptian cuisine hearty thick gluten rich round and flat its consumed with almost all egyptian meals eaten fresh daily street side bakeries like this are found on every block with delivery men nimbly balancing racks of fresh bread on their heads music way in the back room tucked away from the daylight you see where the process begins hes already made the dough and then he portions it into these perfect little balls and it goes on top of this powder this powder is like a wheat flour thats been baked its only purpose is to make the dough not stick to the sheet and look at how he moves each of these big old pieces of wood gets about 15 to 20 on there now this is going to hang out here in this room for about 20 minutes to an hour during that time its gonna flatten out naturally and then its gonna be ready to go into the oven thats the next step but here i just wanna appreciate the skill i mean look at this its like an optical illusion how is he doing it nice thank you boom boom music we are now at the roasting station so this is where its going to go from dough to something beautiful hes gently peeling it off of this dust its like a wheat dust that everything rests on and the way he flips it in his hand it kind of helps expand the dough and then that gets plopped onto here this is a conveyor belt its super hot hundreds of degrees you can hear the fire underneath heating it up so they bake hundreds of these at a time load them up on the conveyor belt and that just moves and moves continuously and on the other end let me tell you my hubby b that is magical music the bread is completely done and they lay it out here so people are coming every minute every second ordering big bags of this bread and sometimes you see people theyll grab these big pallets of bread put it on their head and theyll even ride a bike while carrying the bread and delivering it to different restaurants or different families theyre bringing a fresh one here right now oh and im like yes yes look at this oh it is like a chuchu train its full of steam its hot its toasty on the top you can see the different textures the bottom texture has been affected by sitting in that wheat dust its a bit rough and coarse and then on this side of course you can see how its been toasted by the flame that is beautiful and its so hot oh its so delicious its warm its stretchy its soft its a little bit toasty since its so fresh this bread plays a huge part in egyptian life not only incorporating caloriedense carbohydrates into the local diet for thousands of years but it can also be used as a utensil pick up food scoop up some sauce or wrap it around anything you like so thats how you make egyptian bread so im going to break off a piece im going to dip it in the food i want to really mix the contents mainly that bean but theres other flavor enhancers in here too theres chili powder tons of tahini try it out its got a lot of flavor i mean its really starchy from the bean thats the main thing i noticed the tahini is very unique because it almost acts like a yogurt the way its mixed with different dishes but its not dairy at all its crushed sesame seeds that have been cured down into this thick sauce im feeling it not super bold flavors but its hearty its savory and it kind of gives you a lot of energy for starting your day the last thing i want to try is this right here so this is the one called mish mish is a traditional and pungent egyptian dish made by fermenting salty cheese for several months or even years that is intense super salty kind of pungent and then the tomatoes offer some relief because its just so powerful it almost has a fermented quality to it but i like it it seems like a good food to mix and match with everything else youre getting some new flavors and then you can move back over to the pool so this is it a beautiful way to start your day a ton of foods here and actually all of this for under five dollars you cant do much better than that so thats breakfast we have a lot more food to see today lets go we are on our way to our next location but first i saw a gentleman making street food i like his style hes a hustler he drove here on his motorcycle he brought all these ingredients that hes making sandwiches and this reminds me of these long thin bun meats they have in vietnam so right here you see a long thin baguette bread so he just takes the egg he cuts it into slices he puts salt pepper and then he puts something they call here turkey cheese the cost is about under a dollar im gonna oh i dont feel weird eating long objects like this on the internet i dont want you guys to photoshop anything in my hand hold on im just going to block your view mmhmm music is this the best thing in the world no its cheap its quick its easy it tastes good theres soft bread here and theres cheese oh cheese the cheese has a very sharp almost delightfully stinky smell to it what i like most is just the story of whats going on here more than anything else i like people who hustle and work their ass off thats what hes doing here sir hello oh wrong head music located in the heart of downtown cairos hectic car mechanics district our next treat is inside here a local hot spot offering one of egypts national dishes people dont just line up for the flavors but to take in the gravitydefying display music welcome to one of the busiest street food locations in all of cairo this place is wild its mad its very busy sorry am i on your way see you see what im saying let me do a spin move right here oh more good behind me theyre making a food called kosheri they have an assembly line full of gentlemen who are one by one adding ingredients that add up to this really famous dish im gonna go back there now and maybe get kicked out i didnt ask permission lets go koshery a type of mixed rice dish originated during the mid19th century this dish combines italian and arab culinary elements excuse me thank you as you move down you see this is where the action really happened so many raw ingredients is beautiful applause so they have the rice they have pasta two different types of pasta theres a spaghetti and kind of like a cut up elbow noodle then theres some meat and right here this is my favorite part the fried onions he flips it in and he really gives it some style can we see it boom there it is clip flip flip i gotta say his accuracy is not 100 about half of the fried onions are actually getting into the container but its a great show and all the people theyre looking up at us here they cant see all the onions being chopped on the floor after the onions it gets the tomatoes it gets the chickpeas but thats just if youre getting it for takeo if youre eating here like i am they build the rest of the dish at your table lets go see what that looks like now all right all right everythings separated right now on the sauce they put salt and pepper a little bit of vinegar something spicy oh yes squeeze of lime or lemon and then they put that on top of the feast right here that looks incredible look at this im now an expert but when you come to places like this you have to look around and see what other people are doing and i see that no one just eats it from the top to bottom they mix it all up and they get it all layered so all the flavors are in each bite im gonna grab a big spoonful that looks beautiful music wow its like a spaghetti so its like a spaghetti but then you have the fried onions which adds an interesting dimension of savoriness and then youve got chickpeas in there theyre almost soggy but it adds a very different texture to everything there is some meat on here but its not super easy to taste amongst everything else a lot of this series is about me trying to figure out what egyptian food even is because its something ive never experienced before now im in the heart of the country im trying really authentically pure egyptian food can i put my finger on exactly what egyptian food is yet no i need to keep trying i need to keep eating music just after filming kosheri the police stopped us and made our production van drive to the nearby police station they caught us in the sinful act of filming bread on the sidewalk right now the van is at a police station all the local people have been taken out of the van theyve gone through the shots on my phone and we dont know whats going to happen next its possible theyll try to delete the footage luckily weve already just airdropped the footage to a decoy phone so it doesnt matter but hopefully it doesnt get to that anyways but this is what its like to shoot here all we were doing is shooting with phones on the street at a bakery and that was enough to have our whole vehicle have to be pulled into here to speak to the police and to justify our actions even though we have a permit to shoot doesnt matter so im not sure whats gonna happen were gonna find out pretty soon music so we just got done with the police were at our next location now get this they told us to delete our footage why no reason do we have a permit yup do we break a lot no as far as i can understand it all depends on how the people at the top are feeling on that particular day what they told us is that the footage of the bakery we shot wasnt beautiful it wasnt pretty enough it didnt meet their standard they told us to delete it suddenly these guys are documentary filmmakers i dont get it so did we actually delete it absolutely none while we were waiting we airdropped all the footage to an extra phone thats the phone i showed them and thats the footage i deleted they dont even know how the phones work its all the footage is in my delete bin right now i can just restore it at any time so thats fortunate but literally every minute were shooting in the city were looking over our shoulders were constantly paranoid and uh i dont really like it its not that fun to be honest but we have a job to do the mission must go on i actually really like this next food were doing so im going to get to it music when it comes to egyptian street food hawashi is a big top contender and when it comes to hawashi well you must come here the perfect place to film street food while being shielded from the view of the police this place is called hawaushi alrafai theyre known for their unique recipes and a wide ranging menu with tons of variations like hiroshi with cheese or other various meats now the question that must be answered what the heck is a hawashi this is one of my favorite foods ive tried so far im sorry i tried this one without you guys sometimes i eat on my own time and its one of my favorites so heres how it starts first of all this is just like the egyptian bread my man here he cuts the edges off so it can be opened up easily then over here theyre weighing out some minced lamb meat that lamb meat is spiced its delicious and it gets spread kind of smeared by hand within this bread disk hawashi is a typical egyptian sandwich what makes this place stand out are the secret spices they put into the meat once a batch of hawashi is stopped they bring him to the grilling station here he puts it on this very hot griddle the meats gonna cook through the bread didnt get crispy and all of it is going to be absolutely delicious ive had this before but ive never had it with cheese its steaming up theres spices theres lamb theres cheese it smells incredible let me show you really quick i love this oh yes ooey gooey cheese on the inside oh as he cuts it you can see the cheese squirting out that looks so good aside from this we also have pickled vegetables and we have tatini here now ive tried tahini a couple times today i still dont quite know what it tastes like because i havent tried it alone interesting to me its similar to a hummus its a little bit different feeling in your mouth because its not made with chickpeas its made with sesame seeds but with the spice the salt the texture its a little hummusy im gonna try some of these pickled vegetables right here weve got tomato eggplant im gonna grab some of the carrot whoa okay pickle overload i think that is the palate cleanser but i need to cleanse my palate from that with the pepsi ive noticed in this country the pickles are on another level theyre super salty sour and spicy too its kind of addictive though its such a powerful flavor it punches you in the face like eating raw garlic but then after a while it goes away it dissipates and you want another hint this is why were here oh beautiful cheese pull well try it out music theres so many things to love the texture is so crunchy the bread by itself is amazing the meat is beautifully seasoned almost a little bit like eating a seed kebab with all the spices and flavors and just a very fine mince take a look at this here you can see when i peel the top layer off the cheese is still picky not too liquidy not too solid give it a little bit of a dip is this what people do im assuming its there as a dip like ranch music i dont know if i can say its improving it it is adding a different level different dimension its like dipping something thats already very delicious and putting it into hummus it doesnt need anything extra its beautiful just how it is just like your wife girlfriend whoever youre sleeping with i keep telling them that they love that stuff i believe if its not too late weve got one more spot to go lets do it if the police dont stop us rivers winding round words in my head shivering our first day of shooting in cairo was quite a mixed bag the police took our cameras our local egyptian producer turned out to be completely incompetent and even more police told us to delete our i ate some fantastic food my favorite thing weve tried today and i get to visit one of the seven manmade wonders of the world music we are right outside the pyramids right now were going to ride the camels because thats what you do when you come here ive been told the first thing i should do is find a camel that speaks to me music this one just farted it has gas thats how i know its my spirit animal all right this is a camel for me this series and my experience in egypt theyre both complicated i have nothing against the people of egypt i just think in a country that makes 12 percent of its gdp from tourism the police the authorities and those who run this place might want to stop treating their tourists like spies and criminals next time on day two against my better judgment ill be going for another round in cairo lets hope it goes better than today music best ever food review show is a small team of independent creators and everything we do here works because of you guys click the link in our description to join our patreon and receive exclusive benefits of peace camera tips oneonone right now were riding through the sahara desert actually were being pulled so step one is have someone who just pulls your camel step two they connect them together see theres one behind me right now being behind its a rookie move some of them like mine have terrible guests so whoevers behind me are you all right kai im all right cool this place is so small it barely fits the giant oven thats inside they come here they scoop up some bread they eat music laughter music hello its a beautiful shop you have here oh that was it that was our moment and i flew it we have arrived at the pyramids now just need to get off see i was too heavy i ate too much hummus music oh the bloods rushing back to my crotch area and suddenly im not in cairo because we could not shoot the conclusion in cairo because it was not safe to do so i hope you enjoyed this first video in egypt it is one of the toughest series weve ever made so hopefully youre getting something out of it but i gotta say thats it for this one thank you so much for watching ill see you next time a piece all right im gonna walk the sahara desert until i die

screams forever im dr michio kaku professor of theoretical physics and bestselling author of the god equation and im here today to answer your questions on twitter this is physics support upbeat music cal is not a cow asked yall why do atoms want to bond so much why dont they just stay single you arent missing anything atoms want to bond together thats why we have molecules thats why we have people dna our universe is based on atoms which like to bond with each other the electron vibrates back and forth binding them together and thats why we have molecules thats why we have you you are a consequence of the fact that electrons are shared between different atoms using the laws of the quantum theory debora mroczek asked the question whats your favorite law of physics mine is momentum conservation well my favorite law of physics is the equivalence of matter and energy einsteins equation emc squared this is why the sun shines its why the stars twinkle its what lights up the universe we like to think that matter and energy are totally different things how can a rock turn into energy however if that rock is uranium and that energy is the fireball of a nuclear bomb you realize that matter and energy are two sides of the same coin matter energy is one unit and they can flip into each other under certain circumstances like in the heart of a star sean harris infosechotspot asked does anyone know of people like michio kaku that can explain string theory like he does for people like me and im not a genius well i am michio kaku and id be glad to answer that question first of all most textbooks say that an electron is a dot particles that we see in our atoms measures are dots but if i had a super microscope i could see that that dot is actually a rubber band from a distance this rubber band looks like a dot close up you see that its a vibrating string now this rubber band can vibrate in many different modes each mode can be called a particle so for example this might be an electron but if you twirl it in a different way it becomes a quark and if you twirl it this way you have to give it a different name we call it a neutrino now how many ways can one string vibrate the answers obvious an infinite number of vibrations on the same string and so we think that all the subatomic particles of the universe the quarks the neutrinos the mesons the protons the neutrons theres a galaxy of these particles theyre nothing but musical notes on a tiny rubber band a rubber band so small that it looks like a dot so what is physics that we had to struggle with in high school physics is the harmonies the harmonies of vibrating strings physics tells us how these vibrations move what is chemistry chemistry is when these strings bump into each other and form molecules alex keranskesong asked what is a quark what is omg  crew yeah its oh my god  oh we think that inside the proton there are three quarks subatomic particles that make up the protons and neutrons which in turn make up our universe heres a question from rick sojourner99 we live in four dimensions but can see three how many dimensions are there einstein says we live in a four dimensional world we can go forward backward left right up down and the fourth dimension is time but now were beyond einstein and we have to go beyond four dimensions to perhaps lets say 10 11 dimensions but where are these other dimensions we think they have curled up theyre so small that you cannot enter them but perhaps we can feel their effects and where is this other dimension it is off the plane of your universe perhaps a parallel universe hovering right above your universe in another dimension that we cannot see or touch but perhaps theres a gateway connecting them that gateway is the wormhole it was einstein himself in 1935 who introduced the concept of a wormhole a gateway between higher dimensional universes well the next question comes from jmozac who asked the quantum universe was einstein wrong about his theory of relativity yes and no theres a famous quote where einstein said the more successful the quantum theory gets the sillier it looks he thought that atomic physics that is quantum mechanics was incomplete when the nobel prize was given to people like heisenberg he said yes give them the nobel prize theyre on to something and so einstein had reservations about the quantum theory as the final theory he thought there had to be a higher theory a theory even beyond the quantum theory so einstein was not totally incorrect obi uchenna laing asked what is the god equation well einstein spent the last 30 years of his life chasing after the god equation an equation perhaps no more than one inch long that would allow us to read the mind of god a theory that would unite the two branches of physics on one hand we have the theory of the big general relativity black holes big bangs and the theory of the small quantum theory atomic physics how can you unite these two into one theory at the present time these two theories hate each other theyre based on different mathematics different principles different concepts and yet we believe in our heart of hearts there has to be a master theory out there the holy grail of physics and that we think is the god equation the leading and only candidate for that is string theory and by the way if you ever find the god equation tell me first well split the nobel prize money together you and me heres a question from princeton university press and that it is who is your favorite physicist 462 said that einstein was their favorite physicist 538 thought that richard feynman was their favorite physicist my favorite physicist is isaac newton he asked the question for the ages if an apple falls does the moon also fall and he realized that he didnt have the mathematics to calculate a falling moon so what did he do he invented his own mathematics called calculus and the theory was one of the greatest theories of all time newtons law of gravity and so during the black plague of 1666 one of the greatest minds in history went from superstition and thrust us into the age of mechanics the industrial revolution he changed world history you cant beat that einstein is way up there so is richard feynman but isaac newton tops them all the next question comes from hassan babaji who asks can light bend around corners if yes or no give one reason yes light can bend and around corners in fact thats why we have glass inside your glasses when light goes into glass it slows down slightly because it slows down it deviates from a straight line and thats why we have your glasses telescopes microscopes because glass bends light also gravity can bend light as einstein showed us and we can actually see the bending of light as it goes around a galaxy then the next question is can you bend light completely around an object so the object becomes invisible and the answer is yes its well within the laws of physics that if you could govern the atomic structure sure of glass then light would bend in a way such that it would completely go around an object so anything inside that object becomes invisible one day we will build a meta material out of nanotechnology that will bend visible light so that anything inside that capsule will become invisible harry potter watch out boxxy fan 2001 asks how do black holes distort time and what the hell does that mean time does not beat uniformly throughout the universe clocks on the moon beat a little bit faster than clocks on the planet earth on jupiter clocks beat slower than on the planet earth the heavier the planet the slower time beats this means that on a star like the sun time beats even slower and the ultimate star of course is the black hole the remnants of a dying star we think that at the very center of the black hole time stops what does that mean if you were to fall into a black hole from your point of view it would take perhaps a few minutes lets say to fall through a black hole depending upon where you started from your watch says that you went right through to the center of the black hole but from outside somebody with a telescope looking at you from outer space would see you frozen in time slowly going into the black hole because time beats at a different rate from the outside and the inside get your head around this time can beat at different rates at different points in the universe shelby asked like how are black holes and infinite density even possible like how does something get so dense that it collapses on itself i wanna know we know that if i take a gigantic star or a galaxy and compress it its gravity is so great that nothing known to science can escape the clutches of gravity so light itself is trapped by the black hole and according to textbooks it collapses to a point of infinite density lets be real about this theres no such thing as infinite density we just say that in textbooks because we dont know what happens when a star collapses into a tiny dot infinite density is a shorthand of saying i dont know we really dont know what happens at the very center of a black hole if you do the mathematics very carefully you realize that the black hole is spinning and spinning stars collapse to a ring they dont collapse to a dot at all and if you fall through the ring the mathematics says that you fall not just through the ring but you fall to the other side to a parallel universe that is on the other side of a black hole theres a white hole everything that falls in gets blown out the other end the village celeb thevillageceleb heres a question for physics people only i was sitting in the backseat of a bus which was going at 120 kilometers per hour a fly rose from my shoulder and flew right up front and landed on the drivers so does it mean the fly was going faster than the bus lets let newton answer this question and that is velocities can add if you are a bystander looking at the bus and the fly from outside you would say yes the velocity of the fly is the velocity of the bus plus the velocity of the fly inside the bus velocities can add now of course if youre inside the bus the fly seems to go at a very slow rate if the bus is really a rocket ship traveling near the speed of light and a fly flies inside the rocket ship apparently breaking the light barrier hows that possible well einstein would say that you cannot add velocities in relativity the fly cannot break the light barrier no matter how fast that rocket is moving no matter how fast that fly is moving you cannot go faster than the speed of light newtonian physics is wrong that means that the two velocities have to be adjusted because of the fact that time inside the rocket has slowed down now this is amazing but it works and this has been measured repeatedly with our particle accelerators and our experiments david h ap hywel asked this question what is dark matter can it be touched is it dangerous most of the universe is made out of dark matter dark matter surrounds the milky way galaxy if it wasnt for dark matter the milky way galaxy would have spun out of control and the earth would be flung into outer space can it be touched well no cause it would filter right through your fingertips right through the atoms of your body is it dangerous no because it doesnt interact with us and then heres the big question what is it theres a nobel prize out there waiting for that person who can figure out what dark matter is heeks heekytak asked what is the difference between experimental physics and theoretical physics experimental physics engages in reality it does experiments on things you can touch and feel theoretical physics tries to explain how and why that happens einstein did not do experiments on light beams he did not do experiments on stars and galaxies by looking through a telescope einstein worked with a pencil and paper thats called theoretical physics and the heavy lifting was done by experimentalists who built the particle accelerators the telescopes and the devices that allowed us to probe into the center of stars and galaxies jehan h asked the question for physicists is adding a cape to your superhero costume enhance your flying abilities i wish that there was a magic cape that we can suddenly put on and soar like superman it doesnt work that way birds fly not because they flap their wings birds fly because of the shape of their wings the shape of the wings is an air foil a tear shape for the birds wing air flows over the tear and under the tear creating a partial vacuum on top of the wing that partial vacuum means that air has to flow upwards to keep that wing afloat it is bernoullis principle so its not the cape its the shape of the wing that is the key to flying these are the questions for today and remember theres no such thing as a dumb question years ago when a young boy was 16 years of age he asked a dumb question can you outrace a light beam that 16yearold boy was albert einstein and that dumb question opened up the universe for physicists and for you and me thanks for watching physics support light music
CCc5xfFiz8k,theres a backrooms vr game and its terrifying,Game,music what are you guys doing in your little reddit groups and your honestly i dont know where the back rooms lore comes from but i know that as of yesterday it has gone too far holy cow this is an experience i wasnt i was okay the back rooms has become its own little miniverse of lore just like scp did long ago but im pretty sure before that it was just these liminal space photos that were designed to look as familiar as possible while also being a totally new image honestly they might have been ai generated images where the prompt was just hallway or something like that but an entire lore developed around these photos and that community has grown so large theres now a back rooms vr game and its just the most cursed four dollars ive ever spent i dont wanna play this anymore i dont wanna play this anymore okay this game has so much going for it as a horror game simply because i have no clue what are in the back rooms what are the back rooms i have no idea what to expect see this is the problem with what im doing right now i would like the record to show that im starting this at midnight it is it is if we want to be real specific 11 58 pm the day after this game came out so i have absolutely no idea what to expect is it a ghost thing am i going to run into demons are there wild animals is it a government operation oh go um okay oh it was scary because i wasnt expecting it it was scary because i wasnt expecting it uh is it still there yeah its still there this game probably wouldnt be nearly as scary for me if i knew even just a morsel of information about the back rooms but i didnt so i started playing one night and scarred myself for life finding out im realizing that this will probably be visually the most uninteresting video ive ever edited its just this this is the whole thing ill be honest if theres a jump scare in like the next 10 minutes i ill probably die of a heart attack watching this back is really funny because this is the tutorial area all i had to do here was pick up supplies and solve one puzzle and then i was in the scary zone eventually this should work right five four eight seven its five four eight seven i bet thats it but thats it its five four eight seven oh im smart im actually smart no um absolutely not nope no id id like to go back actually how do i go back it sucks because i dont know what the back rooms are i had some knowledge of what scp was this is just a total crap shoot there could be anything behind this door jump scare what is that an exit a save oh hide what do i need to hide from in this game are you kidding me oh im gonna look oh this is why oh oh oh what is that oh something walked down that hallway tried to kill me thats what just happened there okay no love that sound that was a good sound thank you for that what does this note say the vases one of the vases contain something but but them are so hard to break with hands so you need something else okay all righty i need to find something to break the vases oh you suck you suck youll youll youll rascal what are you doing what are you doing hello what are you doing can i can i go through here please yeah all right thank you oh what is this pick up nose thats someones nose oh plus one knows i mean when the games desktop icon looks like this youre already nervous from the start i felt completely alone and scared in the tutorial area and then i got stuck on one part in the scary area and realized nobody could help me can i use my nose can i use my hand use my walkietalkie can i use literally anything okay well i tried looking up on my phone and since this game came out a day ago theres nothing theres nothing i am completely on my own here to figure this out and not go insane while figuring it out oh what is that what is that what am i looking at is that an okay thing to look at what is that is it modern art oh interact oh boy i dont think im this brave uh oh oh i just go into like third person oh this is weird look at my little baby hands look at my little baby hands okay im good i can leave oh oh i can rotate it how did i rotate it a horse its a horse i did it i did it do i unlock something for that oh i unlock a door oh jeez no whatevers happening im not for it i i changed my mind i want to go back to the vases goodbye it was challenging but i did figure them out and i did enjoy the puzzles i didnt enjoy whatever the  this thing was oh thats so weird i hate that this is such a weird feeling ah stop doing this to my eyes oh oh what is that what is that wheres that what is that what is that oh did he give me did he get me oh my god pause i good luck to you for whatever i just paused it on i i have a feeling i know exactly what youre looking at right now um but i still need to shame the atomic mirror brains this is still happening lets not get ahead of ourselves weve been here before but it is going down maybe we will be rid of this curse eventually not anytime soon but im just saying there might be an end in sight music stop it get some help okay i have my answer its a demon thing its a demon game but overall its a great little indie horror game thats what indie horror games are supposed to do props to whoever made it it got me really good well i dont know oh no not again not again not again not again not again all right whats in here whats this whats this what is this all about no no actually okay what is this so in conclusion the back rooms are gamer purgatory i still have no clue but for sure a memorable experience i dont know how deep the back rooms go i got stuck on the red key part thats as far as i made it so im gonna try and beat the game today the day that i post this video live on twitch if you would like to see the rest of gamer purgatory look at the corpses they hide a secret code just pay attention to the blood this is like the most demented scooby doo episode of all time but thank you for the privilege of your time i hope you got something out of this like this video if you want to but love yourself no matter what and i will see you again in the back rooms with shrek because boy did i laugh the first time i saw that anyways goodbye oh wow making progress in this game okay cool thats cool all right all right then lets keep going lets keep going thank you dead bodies you helped a lot actually you did im gonna go now why is that red
QW3KRaz4aI4,statistician answers stats questions from twitter  tech support  wired,Tech, hello im jeffrey rosenthal im a professor of statistics at the university of toronto and this is stats support upbeat music question from kingdweeb why do statisticians get so worked up over probability every event is just 5050 it either happens or it doesnt this is something ive heard before this idea that well if it can either happen or not it must be 5050 sometimes thats referred to by philosophers as the principle of indifference meaning that anything that could happen they must all have the same probability the thing is its just not true when i go home today from the studio i might get killed by a bolt of lightning or i might not get killed by a bolt of lightning but im pretty sure theres not a 50 chance im gonna get killed by a bolt of lightning okay next we have a question from whatthefuss who says why is statistics important in life really were awash in all kinds of different data so anything from the spread of disease or crime statistics or studies of a medical treatment or financial data or public opinion polls theres so many facts and figures and statistics out there the science of statistics is a way to try to sort through it so if you dont have any statistical knowledge or understanding or perspective then youre likely just say well this must be true because my friend said it or this must be true because i heard it on the news or i just kind of think it must be true but if you have statistics you can try to analyze all the facts and figures that are out there and try to see what are the real trends whats really happening versus what things really arent the way people think they are next we have question from lawrenceitv says question for statisticians why did the polls get it so wrong explanations please yeah so public opinion polling especially when its predicting elections is a very high profile thing but also a hard thing to do and usually people notice the mistakes more than the corrections so a lot of public polling for elections has actually been quite accurate and its predicted things quite well but there have been some high profile misses for example the us presidential elections of 2016 and the 2020 now even in those cases typically the polls prediction compared to the actual results was usually only off by about four or 5 which isnt such a huge amount considering how hard it is to figure out whats gonna happen but its still a big enough error that if the elections close it can make a big difference so why is that well election polls of course they dont ask everybody how theyre gonna vote they just ask a sample usually a few thousand people and then try to figure out what maybe a hundred million people are going to do so that is a challenge the good news is if the polling is done randomly that is were equally likely to pick every person with the same probability then we have good statistics to allow us to figure out how accurate were gonna be what will be the socalled margin of error how close well usually be to the true answer and actually that works pretty well but what makes it especially hard for the pollsters is that its hard to get a random sample and the main reason is because most people dont wanna talk to pollsters polling companies dont necessarily like to talk about it but their response rates are usually less than 10 and that can lead to a lot of biases because maybe people who support a certain candidate are a little bit more likely to agree to talk to the pollsters than people who support another candidate and any little response bias like that can have a huge impact on the results question from cmonmattthink what are some common statistical errors and how can we learn to spot them and if possible correct them in others and our own work one of the biggest things is people dont think about what i like to call the out of how many principle and thats this idea that when something happens at striking people will compute the probability of it happening in that exact way to that exact person but not look at the chance that it will happen in some way to somebody there was a woman in england who had two sons who each died in infancy there is something as you probably know called sids or a sudden infant death syndrome so maybe just two times she got really really unlucky and her baby stopped breathing or maybe she was a murderer and she had actually shed actually suffocated them and she was arrested and charged and at her trial they said oh its so unlikely that thered be two sids cases in the same family that we can rule that out she must have actually tried to kill them and thats an interesting example where if you just look at the probability given two kids in one family whats the chance theyre both gonna die of sids of course it is very unlikely but then if you say out of all the millions of families in the united kingdom or in the whole world whats a chance that somewhere theres a family where two kids both died of sids extremely likely and it seems like that was the case with her there was actually no other evidence that she had actually tried to kill these kids she was just extremely unlucky and yet she was convicted she was jailed she spent several years in jail before there was enough of an outcry and eventually on the second appeal the case was overturned question from josh levs says whats more likely than winning the lottery the short answer is everything that is to say if youre talking about winning a lottery jackpot for one of the big lotteries like mega millions or power ball then the chance of winning that jackpot with a single ticket is one chance in a couple of hundred million depending on which lottery so just incredibly unlikely so compared to that almost anything you can think of being killed by a bolt of lightning or the next person you meet will one day be the president of the united states or any crazy thing you can come up with we can estimate the odds for all of them and theyre all more likely than the chance youre gonna win the powerball lottery and in fact one that i like to use as an example is if you drive to the store to buy your lottery ticket youre way more likely to be killed in a car crash on your way to the store than you are to win the jackpot next we have a question from smollymall im just patiently waiting for people to realize that all statistics are skewed because the data is skewed in so many ways that i can cant even list them all so not a big fan of statistics maybe but thats true thats a good point that all data is gonna have some things that are wrong with it maybe it was bias maybe it wasnt measured correctly maybe it only shows part of the story but i dont think that means we should just forget about it and just forget about statistics and data i think what it means is we have to think carefully when we get data we have to say how is this data collected is it an accurate reflection of the truth in what ways is it gonna be biased or misleading and then we can still draw inferences from it but its true that we have to be careful we have a question from john friedberg says about to play what be the absolute worst casino game in terms of player odds any guesses well its an interesting question theres different casinos with different games but one of the games which to my surprise is one of the most popular and also has one of the worst odds against you is the video lottery terminals so people love them but they usually have at least a 5 and maybe 10 or even 15 housage so theyre really not the best game now there are some casino games which have odds which are much better for the players so for example of the pure chance games the game craps where you repeatedly roll a pair of dice kind of like these you have a 492929 chance of winning next we have a question from shavakadzi are murder rates skyrocketing or the media doesnt have much to report so they are focusing more on that yeah its a good question so murder rates have generally been coming down a little bit in the last couple of decades but in the last few years theres been a little bit of an uptake so theyre now a little bit higher than they were a few years ago but theres still quite a bit lower than they were a decade or two go also ive noticed for example politicians and police spokespeople and so on they all will at times say oh crime rates are way up for their own reasons they have reasons for wanting that to be said even though maybe its not actually true so its just one more reason that if you wanna know whats happening with something like rates of crime well dont listen to what a few people are saying look at the actual statistics and then you can see the truth next we have a question from brentaclan says how does probability work in the roulettes so thats a good question roulettes are fairly simple so the standard american roulette wheel has 38 of those little wedge slots and two of them are green theres the zero and the double zero and then the others are divided into eight 18 red and 18 black the person at the casino spins the wheel and presumably its equally likely to come up any of those 38 different wedges so what it means is if you bet on for example red well 18 out of the 38 wedges are red so you have an 18 out of 38 chance of getting red which is a little bit less than 50 and thats why if you bet on red theres an even my payout but on average youre gonna lose a little bit more money than you win you can also sometimes bet on different things like all the even numbers or something like that but whichever bet you do it works out to the same thing theres a slight edge in favor of the casino and thats why if you play roulette over a long period of time its gonna be more and more sure that youre gonna lose more money than you win a question from 6latin6lover6 who makes betting odds is it an algorithm so its a really interesting problem for the bookies or the people who are making these odds now the goal is pretty easy to understand cause if youre a bookie what you want is pretty much to have the same amount of betting on both sides so that in the end you dont really care if the horse wins or not or you dont really care if the team wins or not cause either way youre gonna make money cause youre gonna get your cut whereas if everybody bet on one side and then they all won then you could lose a lot of money but on the other hand how they do that is kind of a challenge and usually theyre updating their odds as they go and if they see you everybodys betting on this one team g we better change the odds so that the next betters are more likely to bet on the other side and im not a bookie but my impression is that in the old days it used to be on just kind of by their judgment or experienced people looking things over and tweaking things whereas now theres so much online gambling that a lot of it is automated and they have algorithms which i think are not simple based on how everybodys betting and trying to adjust things but the goal is pretty easy to understand trying to balance out those bets question from zenodotus what is stochastic process really well im glad you asked so stochastic is just another word for random so it means random processes or things that proceed randomly in time and the simplest example is actually one i sometimes like to illustrate with my students using a stuff frog so ill do that here and we imagine we have a frog which every second randomly decides either to move one step this way or to move one step this way and once it does then the next second it again decides randomly to move one step this way or one step this way and yet its actually really interesting for mathematicians to study this whats the chance that the frog will eventually return into where it started turns out its 100 its certain they might take a really long time but eventually its gonna return to where it started and in fact eventually its gonna be a million steps that way and eventually its gonna be a billion steps that way its gonna go to every single place eventually if you wait long enough with probability one we can prove that next we have a question from anacelx says what does it mean to be statistically significant so statistically significant is saying probably it wasnt just chance that this is enough of an effect that we can pretty much you can never do it for sure but you can pretty much say its probably not due to chance alone probably this actually shows something real there was really a difference or there was really an increase or something really happened it wasnt just the random luck so the basic idea is pretty simple it sometimes gets lost in the details but when you notice something that happens maybe oh this classroom did better on the test than this other classroom then as statisticians the fundamental question youre always asking is does that mean something real like oh maybe the teaching was better in this class or maybe people in that class are smarter or was it just random luck so youd never expect any two results to be exactly the same theres always gonna be some differences okay next question from john elworthy can someone please help with this what are the odds of having three generations of family members being born on the same day first was born on january 10th 1943 the second same day 1994 the third same day in 2022 its actually a good example of the sort of question that theres different ways of looking at the probability so if you just say theres three people what are the chances theyll all have been born on the same day well thats pretty straightforward so you can think well the first one could be born on any day doesnt really matter then the second one has roughly one chance in 365 of being born on that same day and then the third one has roughly one chance in 365 of being born again on that same day so its one chance in 365 times 365 which was at a little lesser and one chance in a hundred thousand i think so its quite unlikely one way id like to look at these kind of questions is this is sort of out of how many different ways that this could have happened so even in this one family probably theres a lot of other people in each of those generations and if any three of them had matched up their birthdays then the same tweet could have been written so right away the chance is a lot bigger cause theres lots of different combinations which all could have led to the same conclusion its not incredible that it happens but its still pretty cool when it does happen to you from ajaoseyi says how best can a statistician explain p value to a non statistician yeah so thats a good question the basic idea of a p value is the idea of what is the probability that the thing you just observed wouldve happened just by pure chance if there was no true effect if we look at lets say we have some people with a disease and we give them a new treatment and then a certain number of them get better do we say oh well that means the new treatment really helped well no cause some of them wouldve gotten better even without this new treatment maybe more of them got better than youd expect on average from the new treatment yeah but how much more and the p value question would be whats the probability if we hadnt given any treatment that that same number or more of the people would still have gotten better and if that p value is pretty high maybe there was a 40 chance that they wouldve gotten better even without the treatment we havent really proved anything and the typical standard is that if the p value is less than 5 or less than one chance in 20 then we say okay its pretty unlikely that they all wouldve gotten better if it hadnt been for this new treatment so this provides some evidence that the new treatment is helping but if the p values larger it doesnt okay so next a question from king mbuso says statistically what are the chances and right and this is a display of draw results and i believe this was from the south africa powerball lottery back in december of 2020 and what happened was a little surprising so of the main numbers there were five numbers chosen in a row five six seven eight nine and then the bonus powerball number chosen was a 10 so we had six numbers all in a row for the draw seemed very surprising so you could say what are the chances of that happening well the rules of the south african powerball then were you choose five numbers between one and 50 and then a bonus number between one and 20 so you could say how many different ways could you get them all in a row like that well the first five numbers would have to be five numbers in a row starting with something from one two three up to 15 really so thats only 15 ways and then the power ball number would have to be the next one so theres a very small number and then when you divide that by the total number of different ways you could have chosen those five balls plus the one bonus thing theres many more of those so when you divide it you get that theres a little less than one chance in 2 million that such a sequence like that wouldve come up question from chris masterson is it statistically less likely to be in a plane crash if youve already been in one well no and of course the answer is no and if you think about it how could it be how could this new plane know wait a minute theres somebody on here who was on another crash so i better not crash this time thats just not the way science works its not the way airplanes work its not the way pilots work but a lot of people will think that and the reason people think that is because its very unlikely any one person is gonna be on two different that crash right thats really bad luck but once youve already been on one that was very unlucky but now it doesnt have any effect on the probability of the next plane they are what we call statistically independent events so neither one affects the probability of the other so a question from tetraform says hey what is the most statistically improbable thing to happen to you well when i was in my early teens my family went on a trip to disney world florida and in the middle of it all we looked up and we saw my fathers cousin phil and he lived in connecticut at the time and we lived in toronto canada and we had no idea he was gonna be there i said what are the odds that out of all of the hundreds of millions of people in the united states and all the people that visited disney world that my dads cousin would to be there its a good example that on the one hand if you just say whats the chance that one guy would be my dads cousin phil its incredibly unlikely but as with a lot of things if you take the bigger picture you can say well my dads cousin phil isnt the only person we wouldve been so surprised to see what about my dads other cousins or my moms cousins or my cousins or my piano teacher or my friend from school theres probably a few hundred people that we wouldve been really surprised to see and then you say well we were at disneyland for a couple of days and we went on lots of different rides and so on and we probably saw thousands of people and just one of them was my dads cousin phil the other ones were other people so its actually not so unlikely and i end up computing theres about one chance in 200 or so about half of 1 that if you go on a trip to disney world and spend a couple of days there on all the rides that you run into somebody that you know so its not so incredible even though it sure was a surprise at the time okay so i think thats

Fo_lDTDSO-M,jim carreys eye opening speech  best motivation ever 2021,Motivation,life doesnt happen to you it happens for you sometimes i think thats the only thing thats important really you know its just letting each other know were here reminding each other that were part of a larger self you are the vanguard of knowledge and consciousness a new wave in a vast ocean of music possibilities music on the other side of that door theres a world starving for new ideas new leadership ive been out there for 30 years it can be rough out there music but thats okay fear is going to be a player in your life but you get to decide how much you can spend your whole life imagining ghosts worrying about the pathway to the future but all there will ever be is whats happening here and the decisions we make in this moment which are based in either love or fear so many of us choose our path out of fear disguised as practicality what we really want seems impossibly out of reach and ridiculous to expect so we never dare to ask the universe for it im saying im the proof that you can ask the universe for it music you can fail at what you dont want so you might as well take a chance on doing what you love i watched the effect of my fathers love and humor and how it altered the world around me and i thought thats something to do thats something worth my time music applause i realized one night in la the purpose of my life had always been to free people from concern music how will you serve the world what do they need that your talent can provide thats all you have to figure out music the effect you have on others is the most valuable currency there is dont let anything stand in the way of the light that shines through this form risk being seen in all of your glory ive often said that i wish people could realize all their dreams and wealth and fame and so that they could see that its not where youre going to find your sense of completion music my soul is not contained within the limits of my body my body is contained within the limitlessness of my soul one unified field of nothing dancing for no particular reason except maybe to comfort and entertain itself the imagination is always manufacturing scenarios both good and bad and the ego tries to keep you trapped in the multiplex of the mind our eyes are not viewers they are also projectors that are running a second story over the picture that we see in front of us all the time fear is writing that script and the working title is ill never be enough music no matter what you gain ego will not let you rest it will tell you that you cannot stop until youve left an indelible mark on the earth until youve achieved immortality music relax and dream up a good life its just about letting the universe know what you want and working toward it while letting go of how it comes to pass your job is not to figure out how its going to happen for you but to open the door in your head and when the door opens in real life just walk through it and dont worry if you miss your queue because theres always doors opening they keep opening a chance on faith not religion but faith not hope but faith i dont believe in hope hope is a beggar hope walks through the fire and faith leaps over it you are ready and able to do beautiful things in this world its our intention our intention is everything nothing happens on this planet without it not one single thing has ever been accomplished without intention i was a little kid and i would sit there and i would try to figure out what it meant what it was all about why are we here what is this and one day i read something from buddha that said that all spirituality is about relieving suffering there are generations growing up right now who are learning to lie that lying is okay that youre supposed to hate half the country youve got to get back to a place where we realize that a vote is not who you are what were doing why were building these abstract scaffoldings of who we are you know im a canadian american and im this and im that and im a catholic and im a that and its all abstract stuff and when you drill down theres no you left i really cherish that and we are all one thing freedom comes in there only being one you and it includes the table and the computer and the ocean and the trees you try to breathe without them you know you cant music i was in my studio painting in new york one time i took a walk for a couple of walks and i found this wonderful little park where these guys were playing soccer watch these guys play soccer watch this guy chasing the ball and i went thats it i was compelled by that guy who was so involved with getting the ball all sports work you know all art works on the same level and that is presence meisner one of the tenants of his technique is that if you are actually interested in what youre doing youll be interesting to watch and thats why we watch babies because they discover things for the first time no one gets through this life its too challenging and theres too much stuff coming at us we dont have the bandwidth to handle it we have to find ways to escape it we have to turn the gadgets off we have to find moments in nature meditation is helpful really helpful music anything that doesnt work out i always think of as this is the way it was supposed to be thats the way it was supposed to happen because theres something bigger down the road music im finding that people are for the most part accepting of another kind of way of looking at things or letting go of character music i do believe in manifestation power of that kind of stuff but i dont believe that any of it matters you know this mattering is a to me a human construct uh born out of a need the same need is you have to have you know deities and things like that i believe in an energy of god everything is divine its been a part of the evolution of ego is to uh spend your first half of your life acquiring and adding thinking you can add to yourself and it looks great when you got a cool car and you got nice clothes and youve done something that people admire but it can never fulfill you you can never be happy you know what i mean its not its not where happiness comes from the feeling of wholeness is a different feeling than meanness i dont exist theyre all characters that i played i played the guy that was free from concern so that people who watched me would be free from concern applause im not trying to tell the people how to live their lives im just having fun trying to transmit that to the audience and trying to get people to feel that you
dYvUcFvF-V0,just another vlog lol,Vlog,good morning music it is 8 30 in the morning i am sitting outside of a coffee shop i am going to pick up my coffee in approximately 10 minutes once its done because i ordered it on my phone and it says that it wont be ready until 8 40 and its 8 30 now which is honestly    annoying like how long does it take to make an iced almond milk macadamia nut milk latte seriously anyway i had a burning urge to spend the day out of the house today i woke up this morning and i was like i dont want to be home maybe subconsciously my brain was like you need to spend the day outdoors were having a grand day out while i wait for my coffee apparently there was a louis vuitton fashion show this morning at five in the morning i missed it i did not wake up on time because just wasnt happening um but while i wait for my coffee im going to watch the show wow oh i like that one i really like that one look at that also wherever the    this fashion show was i want to have my wedding there oh that thats gorgeous okay that was fun um started my morning with a little a little runway fashion to inspire me to get me revved up for the day i dont think my coffee is ready yet but i feel like i should just go out there and ask im back im not really fully woken up yet because its like 8 30 i mean like i im awake i am awake i am ready for the day but i still feel a little bit you know cheers okay my coffee machine broke probably three weeks ago i ordered a new one and it still has not come which sucks but its also a fun excuse to like go out and get coffee every morning which honestly i do enjoy i do like the experience of going to a cafe and you know you know enjoying it and all that anyway i think that for our first stop of the day we are gonna go to the gym you might be thinking emma why what has come over you why are you going to the gym who are you we dont recognize you were scared were frightened im not gonna lie im kind of really into going to the gym and i kind of been falling in love with it and im kind of on the brink of becoming a fitness influencer like im really this close i know i talk about this too often like while im driving to the gym im like ugh but i know how good im gonna feel once i get started its interesting ive always been somebody who has been better at challenging myself physically than mentally for example id rather force myself to run a mile in like six and a half minutes than force myself to learn how to play a song on the guitar i would rather ride a bike for 20 miles than spend 20 hours on a painting ive just always preferred physical hobbies maybe i should run a marathon i feel like i need a goal like that you know although i dont think i like running enough to do a marathon so im gonna have to kind of think about some sort of uh goal maybe i should do well you know whats trendy in the youtube space right now is wrestling matches okay if i had to wrestle a youtuber why do i feel like im gonna get in trouble if i literally mention any youtubers name you know what i im gonna stay out of it im not gonna wrestle anybody i dont i hate it the way that the youtube community works is you say like i wanna wrestle blank and the next thing you know like you have to start training i am drinking double energy drinks right now celsius and a coffee thats so bad for you dont do that comment down below if you want to see me box another youtuber and tell me who you think i should box im kidding because i would never    do that i really dont think i could punch somebody i think i would just let them beat me up theres no way that this is good for you i dont know why i got a coffee if i was just gonna come to the gym and drink this im gonna be anxious as    oh god this is a lot of caffeine in it wait how much are you supposed to have in a day 400 milligrams of caffeine is healthy for an adult this has already 200 lets see how much is in my coffee okay this has approximately almost 200 as well because i got four shots of espresso in it so basically ive already maxed out on my caffeine for the day im not ill save this for after my workout but like why do i do this i also am kind of dreading going into the gym right now at this hour im like not fully awake yet so im wondering how this is gonna go i feel like i need this to like i need to finish this yes music i im tired i did a little running i did a little walking i did a little bit of stretching the thing that i love about la is that lets say you work out in the morning and then you want to like go run errands afterwards that is absolutely acceptable here in los angeles because people just wear active wear all day every day anyway so i can walk around sweaty in my workout outfit all day if i want brace yourselves ive made the spontaneous and random decision to drive to the beach i live in california i live by the beach its summer its hot out its already 75 degrees its gonna be like 80 degrees i need to use california for what it has to offer and one of my favorite things it has to offer is the beach i am gonna go on a really really nice really relaxing stroll then im going to go and get some food its going to be a whole thing the beach is only 30 minutes away from me if i dont take advantage of it this summer ive failed for the first few months i like dont take advantage of the fact that its summer and then for the last month and a half i like really go hard ive made the decision im like im gonna go hard all summer beach every day    it why not maybe not every day but like a lot of a lot of days you know whats crazy i was in the gym today and i swear to god i see the same people in the gym every day and whats crazy about it is is that i go to the gym at like very different times every day like sometimes ill go at nine in the morning sometimes ill go at noon sometimes ill go at 3 pm and i still see the same people every time which makes me think that people just hang out there all day maybe thats an la thing like im kind of dumbfounded what like what are these people how do these people have enough time to be at the gym for like eight hours a day but honestly like mad respect like i good for them but like what are they doing one more thing about the gym showering up the gym when i used to go to the gym in high school i would always shower at the gym and it like didnt bother me but like i have a raging phobia of showering at the gym and of somebody filming me naked i was thinking about it and i was like okay worst case scenario somebody filmed me naked and posted it to the internet would i really care not really i would hope that they got a good angle at least bare minimum i was thinking about it and i was like i wouldnt really care if there was a video of me showering at the gym on the internet like it would it wouldnt be my favorite like it definitely would not be my favorite thing but i think id get over it we all have boobs in the cooter yet i still am like scared nobody can drive nobody can drive here im still frightened of showering at the gym despite the fact that like i dont think i would really care that much i feel like sometimes i fear things even though like they wouldnt be that bad if they happened like this is a great example like i have this weird irrational fear that somebodys gonna film me but not only is that not gonna happen because its extremely illegal and also just people dont do that but also even if it did happen i wouldnt real it would be fine thats i guess what anxiety is so maybe im just describing anxiety okay great good talk so i made it to the beach which is amazing but i also ran out of gas so im going to make the risky decision of going to the beach and then hopefully i have enough gas after im done at the beach to go get more gas i love a little bit of spontaneity in my day you know but sometimes im a little bit too spontaneous and i neglect to do the minimum preparation like i i fail to even check oh do i have enough gas to go all the way to the beach well so thats where im at i think i have i mean i think i have enough gas to make it to the beach and then make it to a gas station after the beach i think i do it will be a fun adventure um im trying to look at this in a positive theres a    gas station oh the universe got me i feel so    lucky look right as i was talking about it too i swear to god the universe really got me sometimes wait this is actually cute shout out to the universe that was really sweet of them music that was nice i sat on the beach soaked up a little bit of sun but now im    starving i am excited to announce that im going to go to drumroll please air one shocker so excited to announce that they have one very close to the beach that im at and im excited to announce that i will be attending air one right now im actually on the way i decided im also going to put a bathing suit in my car and a towel in my car and im going to keep it there at all times so that if i ever make a spontaneous uh decision to go to the beach i have the proper equipment because i was a little bit bummed out that i couldnt swim in the ocean because it just looked so delectable and i saw all these kids swimming in there and i was like    you guys like like i was literally jealous of the 12 year olds that were in the ocean and thats not necessarily the best feeling i learned a lesson now im just going to keep a bathing suit in a towel in my car at all times music i am such a creature of habit i get obsessed with like one thing and then i just wear it out like right now its this stupid salad from erwan its just a matter of time before im sick of it and then god knows whats next but i just like i get obsessed with things and i get into a routine and then it evolves and like you know who knows what comes next but right now its this    its air one music its    hot in here i just got out of the shower i feel absolutely incredible my earring just fell out i feel so tired because i did so much in the beginning of the day like i already went to like its only like 2 pm right now its bedtime for like a little bit like just a little afternoon nap putting in my hair products i just put in a detangler and a hair oil im gonna brush through that i didnt wash my face in the shower because i decided that i would do my whole skincare for you in honor of the sponsor of todays video bad habit skincare thank you to bad habit for sponsoring this video let me show you my double cleansing routine i like to double cleanse when ive been wearing a lot of makeup or when i sweat a lot when its really hot out because double cleansing really ensures that your face is as clean as it can possibly be first im going to use the bad habit ums acai nightly cleansing balm this works really well for taking off your makeup at night but i use it more than just that then this says grapeseed oil vitamin e and shea butter in it which all moisturizes and softens this is just going to help me get off all that i sweat a lot in the first half of today and i feel like i just need to really get in there this is really soothing and really melted away excess makeup sweat the whole nine yards okay so once im done with that dry my face off and then go in with round two wake things up matcha and mint daily cleanser one of my favorite ingredients in this is aloe vera which keeps things calm and smooth and this is the second step of my double cleanse so that i can really just make sure all of the    is off my face okay its very refreshing and cooling now that my face is double cleansed im going to take a mask this is the bad habit face mask trio theres three masks one thats for exfoliating total reboot one thats for hydrating the silent mode hydrating hyaluronic mask and then one for a detoxifying effect which is the 10 minute rehab green juice charcoal detox mask i am going to do the hydrating mask today oh wait i dont know why im opening this one i already have one thats open this silent mode hydrating mask has hyaluronic acid in it to give you that moisture and i feel like during the summer i get kind of dry but this is also one of my favorite masks of all time although i do love to use this total reboot aha bha enzyme peel once a week so were gonna leave this mask on for about 10 minutes thank you again a bad habit for sponsoring this video go check out the new mini mask trio theres kind of a mask for everything in here im obsessed with this thank you to bad habit for sponsoring this video links to everything will be in the description bad habit is available at morphecom badhabitbeautycom and ulta select ulta stores gonna put on some lip mask i washed off my face mask and moisturized i feel amazing i feel clean i feel so much better i kind of felt like    i think cuz i was so sweaty i just like felt gross and then i showered now i feel amazing but its 90 degrees outside which is a little bit much for me so i think im going to do something really crazy and really unexpected right now and im going to read get this im going to read in journal are we surprised were not were not surprised like were just not i also have a coffee did i zoom in like this to block out the fact that i had another coffee on my nightstand yes because we all know that im already at a dangerous caffeine level right now this one might just push me over the edge but in my defense i dont have a defense like i dont time for some selfcare okay did i take a nap yes its now like 5 pm see this is the thing its like if youre productive in the morning you end up having to take a nap and then the second half of your day is    whereas if you sleep in the first half of your day is    but then the second half of the day you have a chance to catch up so i guess you know you win either way i have a lot of packages that i need to open so im going to open a bunch of these off camera because that shits going to be boring and then im going to do a haul of some of the stuff that i either got sent to me in pr or i bought in approximately 30 minutes ill be doing a haul it will be approximately one second for you in youtube time so okay i unboxed most of it and im gonna show you some of the highlights the first thing i got is this vital proteins collagen peptides which is good for your skin hair nails and joint support my mom told me that this is good for me next i got a new milk frother this one looks like its made out of wood which i thought was really nice my other milk frother is kind of dying so i got another one and this one has cute looks like its made of wood much cuter than my other ones does it come with a battery no thats should be illegal moving on i got some biker shorts here are some brown ones some red ones some black ones this is the brand they make my favorite biker shorts ever for some reason then i ordered this bathing suit i mean nothing crazy then i ordered two sweat sets because im just like ive just been like wearing sweatpants so much that i was like you know what im gonna get more so i ordered a little oatmeal pair of sweatpants in the matching little cropped zipper thing i just know im gonna wear these all the time this is from los angeles apparel i also ordered the same one in gray and then the last interesting thing i got in the mail was a package from my girl kim skins i got a little black tank a little brown top this is really cute another black tank but this ones longer a little pair of black biker shorts these are so soft i literally cant wait to wear these a little simple black bralette a sheer creamy colored dress i also got this little tan tank last but not least i got these little underwear shorts those will come in handy and thats pretty much all the interesting stuff i got the other stuff i got was like hangers for my closet cat food cat litter nothing interesting i kind of want to try on these sweatpants im gonna put them on and give you a sweatpant review because to be honest i am so picky about my sweatpants and i will be the first person to tell you that these sweatpants suck los angeles apparel im about to put your sweatpants to the test oh my god um these are actually amazing these are actually amazing dont look at the back of my head lets see how it looks with the matching top lets see if its like a full fit moment i mean it does the job im sold i will definitely be wearing this quite frequently probably more than i should okay well that was exciting um i really want to drink another coffee but its like 5 30 now so thats not good id make a decaf coffee but i dont have a coffee machine right now its broken so this might have to be my favorite time of day sorry i need to pop my ears this might be my favorite time of day in los angeles the day was really hot like it was really hot out today but now its not really hot anymore its just like comfy im gonna have myself a pink lemonade my favorite part of summer is exactly what im experiencing right now when its warm at night and bright and the weather is just so warm and comfy but not too warm i love this    cheers i brought my book out i brought my phone out recently ive been randomly like i never have listened to ted talks but recently ive been listening to ted talks if you dont know what ted talks are theyre like motivational speeches and ive been enjoying listening to

food is medicine the next ones called overcoming rejection like all these things are very interesting and useful i might even listen to music out here like the opportunities are endless i dont know what do i do should i read if i read then i cant look at the view nobodys talking about that when you read its great but you cant look around you thats controversial thats actually controversial maybe

real pickle mango pickles i didnt know you could picklize a mango in this part of the world mango is the most famous form of the pickles oh very sour super salty its like a green olive times a million but i like it here these are parathas but these are not your ordinary parathas because they have different stuffings going on paratha is a flat bread made from layers of dough with delicious stuffings inside like spiced potatoes it starts with the dough flour salt oil and water fill that with mashed potatoes coriander green chili pomegranate seeds salt and red chili powder add butter then a doughy lid on top music it reminds me a little bit of two chapatis with some stuffing in between its super heavy i can taste the potato inside i love the bready part on the outside and then its just a burst of flavor from the masala super delicious i love it music next up the fenugreek paratha smashed with the mortar until it becomes a mushy paste im gonna try a little bit of this one too its super fresh it tastes more grassy it has a really strong chlorophyll taste to it thats really good does the butter go on anything here i use it on everything on everything thats the result of the lassi making right exactly so this is the byproduct or for me this is the product because i love butter music as a butter its so different i think its unsalted right so this youre just tasting really the pure fat but with all the saltiness oh i love it to cap off this breakfast we have the homemade lassi oh its so good it tastes exactly like a sweet yogurt that you can drink super delicious cold refreshing i love it music this is a great way to start the day a lot of new flavors and a lot of things we havent tried so far in previous two days ive seen just a lot of meat heres a little bit of variety and the breakfast its more about dairy products but as the day goes along things will start to get meatier so well take you around well give you the taste of some authentic local goat grilled underground then obviously well give you a taste of how the local people live all right from here we got a lot to see with breakfast out of the way prep for the underground goat cooking can begin cooking an entire goat will require a little effort from a lot of people all hands are on deck lets move some are tasked with the slaughter dispatching the goat skinning it and allowing it to hang so all its blood will drain out others prepare the fillings that will soon go inside the goat par cooked rice mixed with coriander seeds cinnamon black pepper and dried plums now we need the marination squad blending together yogurt lemon juice chili powder turmeric powder fresh garlic and fresh ginger last if were gonna roast an entire goat hole were gonna need a little heat cue the fire starter here we have the pit where the goat is gonna cook pretty soon im still not sure what its gonna look like when the goat goes in here because theres a lot of dirt in here too so are they going to wrap it put it directly on the coals im not sure but im going to find out pretty soon with the prep complete theres only one man who can bring all these elements together meet chef mohammed saeed pretty soon its going to be filled with this marinade right here and if you create more surface area like this more flavor is going to get in there so hes cutting all these little slits scoring it all over the body right now hes cutting off the butthole yeah we dont need that no one wants to see that anyways music oh okay so now theyre putting a stick through that is why he was making the bum a little bigger the stick goes through it goes out the other end like when you eat spicy pakistani food from here its time to put the masala inside this is a ton of flavor in here but then now hes putting in the rice the rice has just been par cooked because its going to finish cooking while its inside the goat after the goat is fully stuffed with masala and rice the chef adds a final fistful of almonds raisins and walnuts now he coats the animals from head to from neck to toe using the remaining masala once the stomach is sealed its ready for the pit music so we have our goat right here gentlemen please proceed anytime youre burying an animal to cook theres always a chance something could go wrong theyve kind of built a groove into the mud here so as they put it down the stick fits perfectly into that groove timing right now i can see theres a bunch of embers underneath temperature its very hot the distance between the heat and the meat these grooves are not deep enough so theyre going to dig these even deeper so the goat can go deeper into the hole it all must come together perfectly now theyre going to put it in the new more deeply dug grooves if youre off its over and there are no redos theyre bringing over a giant lid it might look like a table but its absolutely not a table its a lid im trying to figure out how this works because there is still plenty of space between the hole and the lid oh bricks so this is how they seal it because we want to keep as much heat in there as possible its essentially roasting and steaming at the same time from here its just about getting this kind of sealed so all the heat is going to stay inside as the goat is sealed so is the fate of this meal what youll soon witness is one of the biggest food fails in video broadcast history trust me what i saw you dont want to see with that said im still hoping for the best im looking forward to it music while the goat is roasting were heading out of the compound and deep into the village music where youll witness an unusual food creation youd never see in the city music weve gone even further into the countryside here theyre making a specialty what is this so this is sugar cane juice which is being condensed into a hard form called good ger a local treat made from reduced sugar cane juice this is how sugar was originally made in this region it looks incredible i love the color i mean it looks like they put a bunch of turmeric in there its like vibrant yellow it looks fake almost its the residuals that are coming up from the sugar cane juice it will even become more yellowish and brownish towards the end as it almost like caramelizes exactly music boiling down sugar cane juice until the water evaporates and crystallized sugar remains from this point still the last product is going to take 15 to 20 more minutes the cook adds in ghee or clarified butter that is to make it soft they dont put ghee in it the end product will be a bit too hard the sweet liquid becomes viscous its ready fill the wooden mold with textured treats like almonds pistachios raisins and melon seeds then the thick sugar cane goop theyve poured it all from this huge pan into here im putting my hand just above it it is still really hot this guys like you better not put your freaking handprint in there im not gonna but i might put my initials as it cools down its going to become thicker and thicker eventually were going to be able to eat it but its still hot we are near the final process right here they kind of scrape it off they dont exactly have like a scale or an official measurement they just kind of see what feels right in the moment should we try it out yeah for sure lets go for it music whoa oh how would you describe that reminds me of korean corn tea but also you could call it pakistani fudge the nuts and fruit in there give it some lovely texture its so sweet so addictive because it is just that reduced down sugar what we call sugar right now is something very recent before that people actually use these chunks of good to sweeten their desserts or the milk and the teas people say that this is healthier form of sugar im not saying thats good for your health like you should consume more but if you have to have sugar might as well have this than the sugar sugar this has so much more character like salt and soy sauce arent the same same comparison here white sugar and this not the same leather back at our farmhouse preparations for tonights feast are in full swing three hours have passed and its finally time to reveal the results of our underground goat roast gentlemen its a big moment all day weve been building up to this point right here in this ground beneath this table theres a goat its either cooked or its not cooked this is the moment of truth our beloved chef has few concerns that once we untable this goat whether its going to be cooked or not oh boy if we start down all the way pop it in the microwave if were in the village we dont have a microwave we put it back back all right lets see whoa heres the moment right now so they need to carefully remove it oh ive never seen a goat that looks like that is this cooked because sometimes it can look smoky and not cooked but could be cooked whats the chef saying he seems satisfied but his voice is not very reassuring yeah hes not radiating confidence exactly what does it feel like it feels medium maybe medium rare since i forgot my meat thermometer at home well have to take the goat to the table cut into it and see for ourselves we have a couple different foods here the first one is this what is this for our appetizer bindi ghost chunks of goat slow cooked with onion garlic ginger cumin and kashmiri red chili powder oh and dont forget the okra the most vegetables ive seen since i got to this country tons of okra lets try it out music classic okra a little slimy super masala spicy oh my god incredibly spicy wow but i feel like i cant scratch my throat you actually have that aftertaste when you try okra okra okra im talking about the chilies im talking about okra i do like the spiciness but it is intense i tried some of the goat very nice succulent juicy and so juicy theres one more food here i want to try thats a chicken right this is chicken karaki dispatching of the animal begins normal enough but then something ive never seen before rather than heating water and feathering the bird both feathers and skin are quickly removed together a bit more wasteful but certainly a more efficient method the secret about skin is whenever we are making curries we take the skin off but when were drilling the chicken that is when you leave the skin the d skin chicken is cooked with tomatoes garlic onions ginger ghee and a local masala i can feel such a difference coming here from the city where were eating street food which is meant to be super rich and decadent here it has a much more of a homecooked feel the flavors are a little bit more gentle yes its on the milder side and this chicken is just not just your ordinary chicken this is their home raised organic desi chicken all right im gonna try this out oh yeah thats that organic chewiness thats quite delicious very nice gentlemen the whole community has gathered here behind us right now this is the future of pakistan watching us as we reveal the status of this goat the goat doesnt have to be well done it could just be medium or medium rare or completely uncooked so we dont know because there is a thick cake of masala on the outside so i feel like something here has to be cooked and were gonna take a bite im gonna cut it open now and see here we go music guys is that the sharp sign okay here we go cutting it open that looks like half an inch roughly is probably cooked and then under that pretty raw i believe what i see on the table is goats revenge right when it was being slaughtered i could see in her eyes you can slaughter me but you cannot eat me i think if we skim the top a bit some parts are done you want try these cheers cheers you forgot to put it in your mouth im waiting for something to happen to you its going to take a couple days i do like that masala i think its meant to be cooked to be honest the outer layer is fine yeah lets not go deep im not trevor james i am not going deep today were going shallow how about i check the contents of the stomach music all right looking pretty raw too im going to just put that back im sure the rope is cooked you want something ill save for later maybe hang myself laughter listen this happens sometimes we went for something epic something amazing something i think this chef has not tried himself before right this is from a different region so its like me you know like banana bread i can make that nope cant do it same thing here so he had the idea the principles were in place just slipped a little bit on the execution my guess is that there was not enough coals the coals probably cooled down too much when we put it in there and i think when they bricked it up even they kicked some dirt down and that covered up even more coals so firefly went out an hour after it went in there could be thousand reasons music aside from remote sugary sweets and dirt holes containing uncooked goats theres one last countryside experience one must endure before leaving this place and if you thought that goat was raw well it doesnt get more raw than this music bro what am i looking at here what youre seeing here is a local wwe this sport is called its intense dude and its one of the main sources of entertainment in these remote parts its very intense two teams oppose each other on the field of play the objective touch a member of the opposing team then run back to your side before any of the four can smash you into the ground what if i play against you we can do that ill do it lets do it lets do it music even with the aggression hard hits potential injuries scrapes bruises and hairline fractures out here on this barren field littered with stones amongst those who dont speak the same language youll find what words cant convey music sportsmanship and fraternity a place where the guy who blindsides you sending you hurley toward the rocky earth is the same one who will extend a hand to help pick you back up out here youll find the pakistan that escapes news headlines and documentaries out here youll find the real pakistani music best ever food review show is a small team of independent creators and everything we do here works because of you guys click the link in our description to join our patreon and receive exclusive benefits of peace give it a little bit of not a flip no so as soon as the fire is ready the goat is going to go in maybe some of those goats too theyre looking juicy put

gold for us you know this is how it is exactly better than mark wings yes laughter music guys that is the end of our video i hope you enjoyed it just so you know everything that happened in this video

ZWAcyGLkQXs,illegal street food in africas busiest market we ate it anyways,Food,right here is half of a hoof underneath that theres meat and mussel im literally gonna eat the bottom of a cows foot all right lets try it out music our epic southern africa food tour continues in the country of zimbabwe theres an ice cream guy oh hes turning around no no no i mean oh dang it i got testicles in my hands last time i took on this countrys most succulent street food are we eating with our hands arent we theres forks in here right these are the forks today im back in the capital city of harare heading into africas busiest market its so lively theres so much action i love it im on a mission to explore the most unique flavors and recipes this place has to offer and trust me when i say theres a lot from quality creatures ive never seen anywhere else in the world ive heard of them ive never seen them and here they are millions of them in my hands to cow parts i didnt know people could eat you will eat this whole thing it all starts here aretha good morning how are you today meet aretha after recently losing her job she went all in on creating her own restaurant a restaurant ill get to see you later today this is where she gathers ingredients this place is wild its full of energy tons of people and its just sprawling it goes on forever people are selling everything you can imagine food other stuff im mainly focused on the food market its a place where people are meant to buy food and take it away but wherever you find large groups gathering youll find food including this illegal street food kitchen its not supposed to be here no its not because of healthy hazards you have to get a license because of hygiene because of hygiene with no permit and no clear way to get one the owner here risks it all in an attempt to feed local workers and make a humble living on todays menu grilled chicken and zadza a straightforward favorite but if you ask nicely they might show you this cow lung and cow esophagus i did not know you could eat that here we love it its nice for the vitamins and all the cows cow parts have been boiled down with onion tomatoes and a bit of salt ive learned that this is the classic trifecta used for cooking pretty much any protein in zimbabwe pair with rice and pumpkin leaves that are deceivingly delicious show me how to eat it okay a little bit of rice then you dig in all right thats ridiculous thats super delicious almost sweet and buttery its hard to compare it to another plant do they cook that with butter they just use water wow wow thats stupid good no ones going to believe me but it almost has a sweetness of like crab legs that is outstanding im delaying the inevitable we need to try these the lungs and a big chunk of it lets go for it oh yeah very tasty super tasty and soft too the flavors are not that strong it tastes like salt tomato onion everything here we cook with natural we dont do spices all right that was good no actually that was great but now this is something thats blowing my mind the esophagus you will eat this whole thing yes i can try the chocolate oh like the ring yeah the top ring music well im not sure id say if its tender same delicious flavors what would you compare that to thats like if youre eating chicken wings and you get that really bristly tendon part thats connected to the bone but its all made of that i think it was very nice you need some powerful teeth to get through that mbari musica is located in the middle of harare city a fading radiant of vendors and residential buildings on the market edges make it impossible to measure if you walk from one side to the other how long does that take an hour in an hour thats real big thats bigger than its quite big a walmart i was told somewhere here they have insects yes they do here they have some insects ive never even heard of never even seen before i didnt know people were collecting them or eating them so im hoping to track those down and if i find something could you cook it up yeah i will try and cook it youll try it thats all i ask music its the busiest market in zimbabwe and quite possibly in all of africa as you walk through the market i mean theres no way to just show this place through individual stationary shots you have to feel it in 3d music everywhere you look theres a different food someone carrying something on their head pulling a cart its so lively theres so much action i love it mangoes nice over 17 000 people come here to do business every day boom this is where everything begins everything that gets here it either comes in big trucks or people from local villages are bringing it to so theres people at all levels all scales just kind of rocking up throwing down their fruit and doing their best to sell it before they head home its a distribution center for fresh fruit and vegetables thatll make their way to the rest of the city and surrounding areas behind me theres a literal mountain of corn and theres also 10 people looking at me wondering what the hell im saying everyone here speaks english by the way theyre just like its corn whats the big deal somebody has dropped all this off theyre going through it and people who want to buy the coin they go through they inspect it they check it they buy it they take it home or to their restaurant how you doing see people are super friendly they actually are just not that guy just a five minute walk from where i had breakfast another rogue food stall here theyre serving up different chicken bits including the salty deep fried intestines an excellent snack or drinking food i break them salty super crunchy its almost like a chicken jerky not bad a little bit of an appetizer a little bit of an hors doeuvre if you will its interesting i think because of hygiene i think because of a lack of infrastructure its not really supposed to be a food place but its kind of unavoidable where people gather there will be food here theyre serving intestines before leaving the market crunchy i must see their selection of bugs yes they have more pawnee worms but i tried those before in namibia how does it taste it tastes like a glutenfree food im looking for something i can only find here we are deep in the market right now ive come to your stall this is your area yes where does it start and where does it end its from here so yeah oh so im in someone elses property right now its my profile oh this is your tube yes caroline stahl specializes in pretty much anything shes interested in selling today that includes big headed ants ive had a lot of ants before ive never seen ants like this a variation of the fire ant and an invasive species they have kind of an average sized body and a huge head theyre a soil master and can be found during the dry season theres two kinds here this is this is termites yes thats wild termites belong to the cockroach family they also come from the ground anytime you see these giant wet brown mounds like this well that is a termite mansion ive heard of them ive never seen them well because i live in the north in minnesota we have winter so we dont really have termites and here they are millions of them in my hands if prepared incorrectly you put salts termites can be poisonous this is something i wish id known before tossing them in my mouth music its pretty good that is different than any other insect ive had its a very distinct flavor im glad i tried this its nutty it has kind of a musky flavor even a little like a a woody flavor caroline i would love to buy some of these ants im going to take it to a restaurant im going to see if they can cook it up now with ants in hand im heading to arethas restaurant to see what she can do with this unique ingredient this is fantastic im so happy to be here thank you how long have you been doing this ive been doing this for the past two years whenever shes not cooking at her home restaurant shes catering events or parties today weve invited the whole neighborhood for whatever comes next but first the ants she prepares them two different ways the snack version fried in hot oil with a dash of salt and the meal version where the ants are boiled then paired with peanut butter and cooked down into a sticky paste what is your specialty my specialty is oxtail really thats what we have right here this tail has been stewing for three hours with you guessed it tomato onion and a bit of salt like most foods in zimbabwe this goes well with saadza a mixture of corn flour and water before we get started i need to ask what the hell is this thats our african cucumber my least favorite food is a cucumber and this looks like the grenade version of a cucumber it looks like very aggressive hostile angry at its parents people here call it its like a corvette disease oh spike when you cut this open does it look like a normal cucumber yes he does all right im gonna have to cut this open later mainly to kill it because i dont like cucumbers im gonna try the plain ants here mix it with salsa oh can you hear the crunchiness its super crunchy these are big heads wow thats quite a flavor pretty different than any other ant ive had its hard to pinpoint it im trying to figure out if i like it or not super crunchy salty and then it just has its own little funk to it here its been mixed with peanut butter oh its a nice big bite lets go oh yeah smart the peanut butter it takes the edge off the ants it makes it a little bit more smooth anything with peanut butter is awesome i could mix lupus with peanut butter and it would taste good this is your specialty the oxtail osteel is one of my most favorite things that i cant get anywhere a lot of countries dont have it its also a food that just takes a lot of love and time theres these beautiful cross sections of tail the bones in the middle of course all the meat protein tissue fat is all around it i like it like this oh you just bite it right off the bone yeah im getting my hands dirty for no reason music thats oh as you go up and down the tail you have different amounts of fat and protein so every bites a little different and theyre boiling like the fat has really rendered down i just peel the protein off the bone you can see its like a continuation of the vertebrae here going down in the tail and that muscle just gets so tender and delicious you stole my heart thank you today im making mazzondo mazode is the cow feet then we have the cow head so what do you do with the cow ad we cut it up then we boil it we use an egg to cut it an ax an egg ive got to see that a big feast is coming up weve got some ingredients from the market and then some surprise ingredients i have no idea about i have some idea about i saw it a little bit today were cooking up this whole cow head i have no idea how its going to be done oh my god i dont even know if we can show that on on youtube is that a boy or a girl is it boy how do you know do you have a name tag oh because of the horns beef is common and loved in zimbabwe and here they use every part head to tail back to crack step one remove the tongue which is just hanging off so were gonna save that for later the tongue comes right off so the goal here is to kind of char the skin this is a very delicate process you dont want to burn the skin or overdo the skin or even tear it away you want to heat it up just enough so all the hair comes off the skin is still intact so that can still be eaten later gentlemen good luck i can already see good luck music heres the deal this heads about to get chopped into little pieces so we can get put in a pot and boil for a long time do we have a chef knife no we have an axe hold up hey hold on why are you backing up you dont think i have control of an axe huh todays special cuts include the entire head the tongue and the cow feet now with the head hacked into several unspecified chunks its time to cook boil it in water with a pinch of salt for four hours until the fat renders down and it becomes juicy next the tongue is charred to remove its outer skin then fillet open and spread out giving it more surface area to soak up more salt and to cook faster grill until its cooked all the way through the head meat and the tongue are paired with brown saga made from sorghum this is our final meal of the day everything today has built up to this moment we started at africas busiest market where a lot of the produce for this restaurant is sourced plus we have a cow head im not sure where their cow head is from and i didnt want to ask and i felt like when i saw the head it was too late to ask the cow right now people have dished up some food everybodys eating this is kind of a familiar sight at this place its like a home restaurant so theres a lot to try lets get into it oh this is a tongue right here tongue is tough because tongue can be well really tough if you dont prepare it properly so this took about 20 minutes to grill that whole thing all the way through success oh its delicious super clean taste really dense i mean tongue meat is very underrated i would say tongue meat has a density kind of like heart meat thats good goodness you see theyve cut it and scored it and it could cook all the faster here this is a brown sauza it looks like chocolate malto meal does it taste like that no it has next to no flavor a little bit different texture than the normal sauce i made from corn but of course thats meant to be paired with the other items on the dish because all this meat is very heavy for most people but not for me here head this looks fantastic actually this is reminding me right now of the tail we already had all the beautiful fats and tissues that have rendered down theyre just sticky and slowly coming apart all right theres pros and cons one delicious the fat is just melt in your mouth the meat pulls apart its super tender its made with time and love and a little hostility the cons there are little bone fragments in there you have to chew with caution because you might catch a little bit of a bone splinter delicious this is really outstanding i cant believe it one of the most satisfying things ive eaten in a long time oh look at this what is this its pineapple and cucumber ive been brought a salad to go with all these heavy foods but here they have a type of cucumber ive never seen before when you cut it open it looks completely different from any cucumber ive seen before i dont like normal cucumbers but i like sea cucumbers oh super crunchy its a little slimy its a little bit like the green part of a watermelon but i guess thats what cucumber tastes like here we have our last food first the cow feet hit the flames to get charred scrape down then cut into smaller pieces all this will soon be soup all it takes is salt water heat and a lot of time applause so this would be up on the ankle or a little bit higher up on the leg its just pure tendon im gonna just pull this off take a look at that tendon super delicious when it gets cooked down like this soft yet a little bit chewy but its so rich you can only have a little bit of that all right that is the foot right here is half of a hoof and the other half would be here except they actually cut it down the center when theyre preparing it and whats really bizarre about the hoof is theres an enamel on the outside the enamel is basically like a big fingernail its made out of keratin underneath that theres meat and mussel im literally gonna eat the bottom of a cows foot lets try it out oh thats awesome its not too dissimilar from the tendon almost like snappy crunchy when you bite into it okay this is a little higher on the hoof wow thats just pure skin bones and then some cartilage in between thats fantastic is our third day in zimbabwe im pretty blown away to be honest we went to the market markets can be hectic chaotic sometimes aggressive because people are there time is money they got work to do and they dont have time for bs but here in harare in zimbabwe people have been very welcoming open and just curious about what were doing and just wanting to interact and be playful so not only have i

eaLrWkWuDjw,trying art trends ive missed,Art,music hey its me so i feel like ive been talking about trends a lot on my channel trending recently and how terrible i am at keeping up with them hard to keep up with the trends maybe hadnt noticed maybe you dont care these earrings are a lot too much maybe anyway there have been so many things trending in the art world of youtube in the last year or so i have basically missed oh pretty much all of them i dont know im in my own little world i noticed them i see them i just dont do it until theyre dead and then im like i guess its time to do that thing but i have a whole list of art trends that have gone by that i just have not experienced i just want to try them out even though its a little late now im assuming that they were trending for a reason so i need to see what thats about i dont know what this is gonna be is this gonna be a 2 part 3 part series i dont know were just gonna kind of play this by ear wing it i was trying to think of more expressions that include body parts but i cant belly button it okay the first thing on my list that ive been waiting to try is hydro dipping thats my hydro dip dance this is probably the last time im gonna do it so dont worry maybe i understand the basic process of how to hydro dip but ive never tried it myself were just gonna be kind of trying things and going along and doing it learning as we go if you dont know what hydro dipping is wonderful were gonna learn together okay i believe i purchased all the materials that im gonna need for this boom i got spray paint out the wazoo because i need every single color why because i love them all i got a couple things to try to hydro dip and i got a big tub you are supposed to fill this up with water hydro you take spray paint you spray it in the water and then you dip i have no idea how big of a mess this is gonna make i really dont feel like going outside because its disgusting outside right now its cold i just dont want to is this a bad idea to do it inside should have gotten a tarp hello do you have a tarp what color is it mmm okay okay thank you all all right bye we have a tarp canvas also i did this what am i doing i dont know we have a workspace set up we have protection its time to fill her up music music no no wait a second i cant pick this up i guess this is why youre supposed to do it outside then you can just fill it up with a hose hmm there are multiple ways that this situation could have been avoided i could have brought the water to the bin using a magical thing called a bucket or i could have just filled this up with half of that water and been totally fine this is clear to me no i cant do you like to help me oh that was heavy good thing i did that all by myself no help whatsoever strength and stuff got my table of water its quite warm its actually very soothing kind of lovely i think the sweater needs to come off im gonna open all the windows in the area for proper ventilation its seriously been like three hours since i started filming this video its time to actually do something so i got these little containers from target or like little plastic organizers i guess says bonds to plastic plastic okay open these up ive got one ready just gonna dip it like that what color should we choose for our first hydro dip ever teal yellow orange no green no purple these are the ones did i already shake this one oh my gosh im scared what if i get spray paint all over everything in this room i should have just done this outside honestly is that ruined ready were gonna spray in the water yep this is a quite messy oh gosh i think i might be spraying too close okay music all right oh oh i need gloves gloves and music oh i got it all on my arm let me go attempt to scrub my arm so thats not coming off at all this is what ive made its honestly kind of ugly very lumpy but theres that this is not as easy as it looks we have to keep going im gonna try another color set hey and im gonna wear a mask this time cuz the fumes are real strong its not cute but neither is getting poisoned by toxins oh here we go music music this is the second one and its so much worse so lumpy and globby it honestly looks sidious every time ive seen people do this it just turns out so smooth and beautiful what am i doing wrong here could it be the temperature of the water its quite warm im gonna have to do some quick research i just watched a video they did nothing differently than im doing and also apparently warm water is supposed to be best for hydro dipping so um maybe it just takes practice lets just keep on trying it really here we go hi i was quite focused on the task at hand during this whole thing also i had a mask on so it was pretty hard for me to communicate so im gonna be the voice for myself ive gone for a very bright kind of summery color scheme on this one and going in for the dip i am making sure to clear away the excess paint before bringing it back up because i dont want to double dip and ruin the design and it looks like skin almost lost it i almost lost it again not sure that i absolutely love this one i mean its pretty messy in certain spots but a little bit better than the others moving on to the next attempt im trying to have confidence at this point i got this but im actually slightly panicking i attempted a full rainbow of colors for this one i dont know what i was nodding about this is my only form of communication i was definitely too light on the paint with this one clearly what are you doing theres so many empty spots in that and i shouldnt have dipped it at this point so i ended up with another less than ideal result okay well it doesnt look like the full rainbow is on there normally i only see people use like two or three colors thats best but you know i cant resist im gonna try a few more things i found these coasters they say i wish i could text my dog such a weird thing to put on a coaster who thinks of that why a person who designed this the person who buys this the person who has on their chin and doesnt know it the reason i chose these though is because they were the closest to plain white that i could find im hoping that i can cover up the text with a spray paint if its a problem then i will prime them i really want a full rainbow hydro dip to work out im just gonna keep going i look like such a little bug with this thing on let me take a moment to talk about this process it was kind of stressful doing something this messy around all my arch and all my equipment also it was so few me i feel like i can smell the spray paint just watching this oh its so strong which of course would have been a nonissue if i were outside i dont mind filming little bits here and there outside but i really didnt want to film this entire video outside because i just dont currently have a good filming setup for outdoors without needing somebody else to help me the whole time plus it was really cold whoa did i just say donut oh whats donut so that one actually would have been pretty cool i guess what you can totally see the letters through it and i hate that boom so let me go prime these real quick itll do it my face we have to wait for those to dry so lets keep going what can we do next how about a paint palette okay so this one im doing now is actually one of the best ones in my opinion because i had the paint pretty dense and i was also working really fast switching back and forth between colors it seems to work better when you spray the next color before the previous color closes in like keep the water portal open so you have a clear space to spray into and everything just works a lot smoother that way so this one came out pretty decent i think it looks good kind of cool but then on the next one i relapsed i almost want to try this again because watching myself do it i definitely think i could improve if i did this over but its hard to tell in the moment what youre doing wrong you know but with this one i think i just slowed down a little bit too much spraying too close to the water and i also left quite a few bare spots even so this one isnt the worst one that ive done so far so i guess its okay pretty cool on to another palette i do realize that you can hydro dip multiple things with one round of paint and get more use out of the paint but i was really just focusing on one thing at a time i was barely having success with that much so this one had some really really significant wrinkles i had no idea what was causing it oh this is kind of embarrassing i realized that i had forgotten to remove a clear protective plastic and so heres me skinning it and its its dead now here i go trying again to make that full rainbow thing happen you know every time i see someone else hydro dipping i just think it looks amazing but when i do it i feel like it doesnt look right maybe all of you think that this stuff looks great hopefully why is my vision getting blurry what else can we hydro dip about an outlet cover it looks like im being birthed anyway im working on the paint for an outlet cover if you missed it i decorated a bunch of my outlet covers last week so if you want to check it out in the i cards this one turned out really well one of my favorite hydro dips yet i think it looks really good actually i dont really have any complaints with it wonderful my coasters are dry this is gonna be the last thing i hydro dip so lets make these good i have got to get out of this room ill be back when everythings dried to talk about what ive done just to point out another one of my failures i filmed like this for ten minutes the importance of turning on a microphone lets see if i can try to read my lips okay clap hey so these are all i have no idea oh oh this video so many mistakes okay lets wrap this up now okay ive aired out the room ive cleaned up everything which took absolutely forever that was fun to clean up not really this is what ive done i have a couple other trends in mind that i wanted to do but this one just took me forever and i just couldnt let it go until i made something im satisfied with i felt like it was gonna be one of those things where its like its so easy theres no way you can create something ugly you know its just every time it turns out beautiful its colors mixed together its gonna be beautiful right no wrong i learned that it is possible to make something ugly while hydro dipping because i did it so learning things i understand why it was such a big trend i get it its interesting its cool but yeah this is not what im made to do nope nope yeah i dont know what im gonna do with all this crap there are a handful of pieces here that i do enjoy so if you want to see a part to trying other trends or if you have ideas for other trends that you want me to try please comment down below and let me know what you want i hope you guys enjoyed this video and ill see you next friday bye music music
VTEhYwtjTjo,24 million yacht tour  sunseeker 65 sport yacht,,this is sunseekers brand new 65 sport yacht and its an intriguing boat the amount of detailing that has gone into this is just incredible and it starts literally as soon as we step onto the boat because look at the way theyve done these steps here what theyve done in fact is theyve used flexitek in order to give this curved and formed appearance now just to show you exactly what difference that makes if you go and have a look at this boat next door this is how steps normally look upon to the back of a boat but look at the difference this makes its just fantastic and then the way that theyve mirrored it with this stainless steel trim around here that looks brilliant now you can put a jet ski on here its a highlow platform but theres also a garage in here i think im going to show you in there because it is rather impressive now theres a couple of very interesting points about this some neat detailing so for example look at the shower they built in up here so you have that so that when you capture the swimming or whatever its just like a rainfall shower right there which is brilliant but also look at the way that this is offset its not in the center line and the reason for that is this will take a williams 395 tender that pulls in in the normal way but it means you can get up around and next to it look like this floor is completely flat also means that if you wanted to you could rack this out on this side for dive gear or other bits and pieces so it just gives you a load more versatility than the normal situation of having a rib that goes in and its absolutely nailed on both sides and once its in you cant get yourself or anything else in with it this actually makes for a really versatile area i love the way theyve taken the flex seat all the way into here as well thats brilliant anyway lets carry on up lots more to see and as we head on up what youll find up here is some pad up on the top some nice upholstery on there thats done really well and here were starting to see some of the options that you get theres a lot of different configurations for this boat so you can really tailor this to exactly how you want it so on this one what the owner has gone for is a bench seat here and then over here there is this area which is a grill and then theres sink in there and then youve also got ice maker underneath and theres room for a fridge next to it if you want as well this is just storage on this particular boat however if you prefer you can have a bar here so what that means is that this flip over section here and the reason that this is here is because thats a power window that comes up to close off the saloon theres a door that slides across here as well of course but you can have this much larger so that if you dont have that you can have a bar area here a couple of stools facing in very nice place have a drink of an evening but theres more because if you would rather you can bring this seating all the way around do away with that or the bar area and just have heating all the way up here and across here and make this a really massive social area the table here you can see its got hinges on that folds out to twice its size just comes over and rests over onto this part here this ones also got the extending bimini that comes out of the back of the overhang and in fact this one is as i mentioned the sport yacht that means its got the fly bridge and i will show you that of course intriguingly theres also a predator version and ill explain a difference to that when we go inside now as we go into here again youre going to see a lot of different options this has got the galley aft layout and i will explain why that is an option a bit further into the boat thatll make more sense but what youve got here is youve got your miele oven and your hob some lovely details like the way that theyve done this for the crockery in places like that and its a similar deal actually if you go over onto this side look at these for the cutlery very nice and then theres storage about the place and a bin and so forth and a slimline dishwasher there now what youll notice is theres no fridge and thats because the refrigeration is over on this side of the boat so that is in here now one of the things i do like is the fact that this is completely flat from the cockpit right through this whole main deck right up to the front where you go down to the lower deck so thats a really lovely area to go on through youve got this area which can be for relaxing or for dining and in fact that table is a high low table its an electric table leg and also you can see little hinges that all folds out much larger so you can have it folded down as a little coffee table or lifted up and opened out for a bit of internal dining tv is fixed just here but if you prefer you can have a tv that folds away and a bit more seating over on this side theres a lot of little details that youll notice like for example these stainless steel fillets they put into here that incidentally is the wine cooler and again more stainless here with these sort of grab areas like so now this one has got this glass roof section that tilts for ventilation thats a nice feature i mentioned the predator if you go for the predator you dont have a flybridge so you have a smooth roof but then you have a massive opening section so this whole area here will slide back so if you prefer that configuration then it can be done you just opt for the predator version if we head on forward again it all keeps on coming home area is here theres an ipad dock look at the way theyve done this though so this is proper sort of retro styling across here like a vintage car i love these recessed dials like an old sports car but what you can do with these theres a little control knob here and as you turn that it reconfigures these depending on what you want so its a beautiful meld of latest technology but with that oldfashioned styling then youve got your garmin screens up above there so navigation and radar and that kind of stuff and then over here engine controls ips docking control and so forth another thing to look at is this screen its a massive onepiece windscreen and its a double curvature so it curves that way but it also curves that way that is a very expensive piece of glass it didnt tell me how much it was but i dont think i repeated it it was a lot um lets move on a bit further again you see those integrate these grab rails and places like this its a nice idea youve got steps on down to the lower deck then and that brings you down to this lobby area now again various choices down here and i will explain if we head on through here first of all this then is the vip guest cabin really good size really nicely done love the way theyve done the trick lighting in places like this and across the back here all very nice and also things like this so that lifts up like that to give you a little dressing area you have of course got illuminated hanging lockers in places like that and then youve got storage up behind here and so forth big windows in here as well so great view out we are at the cam boat show at the moment this is interesting they finish this for you drop your watch another bits and pieces into there but that area there is an inductive charging area so if you drop your phone into there and it charges it for you overnight again more of this lovely detailing look at this the way this has been back lit and stainless steel edged thats really nice lets come back a bit further theres drawers under the bed these hatches here are access hatches for systems so thats a quick sneaky look at that when ill show you what i mean there we go bow thruster for example in that one and incredibly thats lit i dont think ive ever seen that before that there right there thats attention to detail thats brilliant equipment in here and you also have as you would expect an ensuite so thats in there separate rainfall shower and then thats obviously a sink and storage again in little areas like this so that is the ensuite to that cabin and theres something ive not really seen on this size boat before and that is that theres a third cabin here that in itself not too unusual very nicely done at two single beds as you can see again a lot of trick lighting around in places like this and up around here but this has got its own ensuite up into there so its completely separate ensuite now the thing is that the master cabin which ill show in a minute also has nonsuite so thats fine three ensuite cabins in a 65foot boat brilliant would you believe if we go over here theres a day heads so not only are all the cabins on suite theres also a separate dedicated day heads as well thats what i dont think ive ever seen on the 65foot sports cruiser before thats remarkable ive seen it on full flybridge boats but not on a sports cruiser like this okay were gonna talk about options again now because this doorway here takes you back into the owners cabin and this is impressive because what it drops you down into is this big lobby area just here separate to the actual sort of sleeping area and through there whats nice about this is imagine if you want to work on the boat spend a lot of time on it you could use this as an officer area and keep it completely separate this pulls out like so so you can sit there and work or do your makeup or whatever else you want to do there and that is a really lovely comfortable area to come into load more storage again in places like this the lighting again up through here thats all very nice drawers underneath now over on this side there is space for a washing machine but this particular owner has chosen not to have a washing machine there we go hes chosen have a big fridge in his cabin instead good for him or her of course i dont know theres a pocket door on this incidentally so that slides across like that okay lets head on back a bit further and talk about more options in a second this then is the owners cabin and that is lovely full beam of the boat again a lot more this trick lighting and a lot more of these lovely finishes on the doors thats into the ensuite huge tv in here as well a lovely place to come and tuck yourself away and watch a movie if we go around here this takes us into the ensuite loves the finishing areas like this that looks really smart toilet there of course and and then a separate rainfall shower in here but that is a nice cabin isnt it beautiful okay lets head on a bit further because i want to talk about options you can if you wish choose to have instead of that door there a door here and in fact i think they bring the whole thing over a little bit and that means you can use this for something else and the options that you have are you can have a fourth cabin with bunk beds in so thatll take you up to obviously a full cabin layout and also it means of course that that extra toilet comes in theyre very handy because it means all the cabinets still have their own toilet but another intriguing option is that if you want you can have a galley down here so how this is a cabin and this is the galley and then you dont have that galley off layout on the main deck what you do up there is have a load more seating so it just depends how youre using the boat and what your preferences are but its really great to see all these different options and be able to choose exactly what you want more is access hatches here again these are for systems like so plumbing in there what else can i show you oh you might notice these hinges people are going to ask whats under the hinges that just a big storage area back underneath there there we go so that is the accommodation love features like this look at the way theyve done this with lighting underneath but also the lighting up above as well thats rather nifty lets carry on up a bit further so this is what i mean if you had the galley down layout then this can extend your seating all the way back you could have this as a massive social area if you wanted because you could have the seating on this side as well with the hilo tv instead of that one and really have the ultimate party boat brilliant loads more to see lets go and take a look at the decks and pop your shoes back on there we go okay well head around this way theres doors in the side in america for example they often more alongside a key so thats a great way on and off again more little detailing let me put these sun seeker logos in the scuppers so thats the water that comes down sort of running back into the cockpit it drains down through there and also if we come back here youve got stern winches for when you are winching into the key when your stern two birthing but look at where they put this little stainless steel plate on where you can see that yeah there we go with a 65 logo that is a little rope bin so that when youve winched in you can drop your ropes into there lets head on around look at this glazing on here its huge isnt it thats come right up now this is interesting youve got this beautiful line you can see the way it follows down here and quite often when you get that you end up with like a cut out where the seating is across the front what theyve done with this is theyve kept this line intact all the way through so you dont spoil the lines of the boat it does mean you have to step across to get into this area but it does mean obviously it is a sports boat it is about style and performance you keep those beautiful looks rather than having that sort of break in the in the section there also very very handy for keeping extremely small dogs in okay i made that up these are carbon fiber poles and that is to support the bimini that this ones got over this area obviously you dont run with that up thats just when youre an anchor or perhaps youll birth in the med stern to the uh to the key and you want to have a bit more privacy so youre up here on the front instead of at the back thats what that does um something here of course and then seating around there lets head on around a bit more because i really want to show you the flybridge on this its intriguing these are little storage bins in here and they drain as well which is nice so put wet fenders or ropes in there theyre going to stay wet the water can get away look at this windscreen this is what i was talking about this double curvature windscreen it curves that way and it curves that way that is a serious piece of glass and thats that opening section we looked at above the helm okay lets carry on back down this side because were gonna swing around and head up onto the fly bridge and this is intriguing look what theyve done here now this is a sports performance boat you can opt for up to 2 000 horsepower so you can have twin 1000 horsepower engines so its got some serious grunt well talk about that in a minute but look at these seats theyve turned this into like a sports car area this looks fantastic what a dynamic place to drive the boat from youll be thinking well thats fine but whats that steering wheel doing up in the air like that ill show you the idea of this and its genius frankly is that you can stand here okay youre moving the boat into an area like this its all very tight you want to stand up see what youre doing you can stand here and the helm is right here where you need it the joystick controls right here where you need it you can stand and look out and get the kind of view that you need however you get out the harbor you want to go into sports car mode park yourself down here drop that down and we are ready to go look at that that is a proper sports car driving experience because youve got the bucket seat youve got your feet on these supports here the wheel is right here and suddenly you can really enjoy the performance of this bait what a brilliant place to drive a boat from that is absolutely fantastic you could really have some fun with this boat they put the throttles down here feels a bit like youre in an aircraft and then youve got your garmin screen down there for your navigation and those instruments again like we saw down at the lower helm which again youve got a selector here you can flick through and you can dial up whatever you want to display in the center so you have revs around the outside this ones configured to knots at the minute and then this one over here is now on depth or as you can see its flicking through rudder and so on there we go course overground whatever you want to have that set to youve also got controls down here for the garmin screen so those remote controls for that youd have to reach and pull away at the screen that little photo theres a scan scut scan scut ill try again that is a scan strut charger so you drop your phone into there i wonder if its on lets have a look ive got one of these on my boat this is the only thing that my boat has in common with this one um all right so that does that there we go charging up and theres also another uh scan cant speak today scan scan strut charger here this one i got one of these on my boat as well thats for uh thats for plugging wheres it gone there we are over there usb is but charging whatever you want to charge on there lets take that off before i wander off and forget it thats the only thing that my boat has in common with this one that and the fact that it floats but isnt this brilliant it is such a nice idea i can just imagine coming out with this and just having such a blast with it which you kind of dont normally do with a 65foot boat but with this you definitely could uh what else can i show you up here if you go on around the back youve got a draw fridge down here so you can keep drinks cool again more of this lovely stainless steel detailing down across in places like this this has got lift up sections so you can sit facing forward you can drop it flat and in fact theyre at this end as well so that will lift up in the same way so if you want to face backwards you can do love the fact theyve colorcoded everything the radar the searchlight the gps aerials the antennas everythings colorcoded black thats nice detailing thats fantastic but i love that i think that is a really neat feature its fun and thats what these sorts of boats should be all about lets press on a bit further more to see would you believe okay back down here now these boats are typically owner operated and thats why youve got that wonderful driving position however there is space for a crew if you wanted to occasionally perhaps doing a longer journey you want to take somebody with you just for an overnight there is a space underneath here we lift that color up and open that one now if you are looking to have regular crew this isnt the boat for you as i say this really is an occasional extra space you might want to you know a teenager to come and sleep in here out of the way tricky blight as they can be but well go on down have a look you could also just configure this as a storage area if you wanted to which is to be honest is what a lot of them get used for but you have got a fullsize adult bed in here and there is a loo down underneath there and a little sink in here as well but i have to stress again this isnt a normal crew boat so people look at these lines go i wouldnt let my crew sleep someone like one no well if you had crew you would be buying this boat it is just an occasional extra space for when its needed some feet going past last thing to show you then is engines and we access those lets drop that one back down first there we go over here so these lovely stainless steel doors we close those over first of all like that again youve got this beautiful engraved sunseeker logos these are the switches things like the lights and the garage open and the bathing platform up and down that kind of stuff is all controlled from there and this one then takes us down to the engine compartment so in here are a pair of volvo penta ips 1350 engines there we go they are a thousand horsepower each and theyre giving the boat a top speed of 35 knots but whats interesting is that if you drop the speed right back if you cruise at 10 knots to get your maximum range youll get 750 nautical miles out of this so youve got a distance if you want it youve got the performance if you want it well its a nice engine space isnt it all those engines they also do a 900 horsepower version of this you can opt for 900 horsepower engines which begs the obvious question if youre buying a boat like this for x million pounds why on earth would you have the slightly less powerful engines i bet theyll never sell them if theres in there but theyll go out with these and would be my guess perhaps what else can i show you in here sea keeper this has got a sea keeper uh stabilization system what this is and in fact its worth looking these up theyre fascinating its a gyro stabilizer theres a gyro in there spins at a colossal speed in a vacuum and then because you have a gyroscopic force then holding uh holding itself upright youve got something to push against and it then uses hydraulics to then as the boat starts to heal one more rock one way or the other it pushes back against it holds the boat level generator thats up in there as well and then other various engineering systems plumbing um these are the raw water intakes for the engines for example and so forth lets come back down here electronics are tucked in behind these fellas so circuit breakers that kind of stuff thats under there theyre quite low over here they always are because thats your tender gouge so thats your choice have a tender garage dont get so much height over the engines but you can get right the way around them which is excellent and down in between them and then they put things like filters over on this side where you can get them easily so thats a nice idea as well theres even a little camera that little fella there thats a little camera so you keep an eye on this when youre underway from the um from the multifunction displays cool boat though isnt it im rather taken to this lets come back about and well go this way oh look at this sunset can how nice right lets drop that one back down spinning across and i think well sit up here with maggie and we will say huge thank you to sunseeker for organizing that tour for me really appreciate it let me know what you think of this one i think its an intriguing boat and id be interested in your comments and we will look forward to catching on another one of these very soon take care bye you

3GNoelvk6S4,what am i supposed to recommend now,Tech, ive added up to here with this swoosh effects with what with this being old enough to remember when oneplus stood for well designed phones with clean software at rock bottom prices its been painful for me watching their slow descent into mediocrity and its high time that i share my thoughts the onetime flagship killer has been plagued by hardware issues software glitches and most damningly lackluster support for the enthusiast users who made them what they are today what the heck happened i used to rely on oneplus as my recommendation go to for friends and family alike the one company shh other than that one that i could count on for years of intuitive software updates and trouble free operation then in the last couple of years ive ended up in the doghouse twice over oneplus recommendations first with my son which is bad enough then with my wife which is much much worse so now to make it up to her im gonna have to buy her something nice with this money from our sponsor  build redux build redux makes it easy to configure your new build with support guides to help you along the way they also offer competitive pricing as compared to building a pc yourself so head to buildreduxcomlinus and start your new build today  while ive been personally frustrated for a while it was an exchange with our good friend steve from gamersnexus that pushed me from im not recommending these to friends anymore to i need to make a video about this it appears that certain models of oneplus phones have been afflicted by a strange bug that causes their storage to fill up at an alarming rate intriguing now the obvious solution would be to delete some cat pictures but if user reports are anything to go by not even a complete purge of precious memories of snowball i is enough to free up the space and in fact theres no indication within the ui of what is consuming all of the storage even factory resetting these devices yielded no improvement so to diagnose whats going on here we need to go to the device logs logs are a record of diagnostic data and they can include information about operating system updates app crashes physical errors anything that could help to troubleshoot a device that isnt functioning correctly only weve got a problem this log data on android isnt available to end users at least not out of the box thankfully oneplus has still got one thing right theyre one of the only android phone makers who still allow adventurous users to tinker under androids hood by rooting their device this process comes with enough risk that most manufacturers will actually void your warranty just for attempting it but it also has some benefits including granting complete access to the phones file system and it was in these typically hidden system folders that a few brave enthusiasts came across some modem log files or dumps that were pretty suspicious for starters they were big hundreds of megabytes in some cases which is a lot of text but your phone generating big log dumps isnt itself a problem its when it doesnt clean up after itself and thats exactly what happened here affected users discovered that oneplus historically well managed oxygenos was simply leaving these logs to pile up until there was no storage left for anything else well great now that we know what the problem is its an easy fix right mm not exactly while rooting is an option for oneplus users it comes with a plethora of inconveniences first and foremost being that many apps including banking and entertainment apps will simply refuse to run if they detect a rooted device not a great workaround it also doesnt change the fact that your system is still dumping these large files into storage on a consistent basis its like okay theres a hole on your ship but dont worry this bucket will save the day dumb we tried reaching out to oneplus about the problem and a couple of weeks later we finally got a reply indicating that they are aware of the issue and have been working to fix it which i mean is okay except that there are complaints about this going back as far as mid 2021 with oneplus reps at times giving users the runaround or even ghosting them entirely we would never ghost our floatplanecom subscribers check it out for behind the scenes and outtakes now in fairness to the reps if my recent experience is anything to go by oneplus software team has plenty of other bugs to squash heres one that persisted on my wifes phone for months okay in fairness the arrow is within about the same area code but shes gonna need a bit more accuracy than this if shes gonna end up on the right off ramp hey my sons deal breaker issue was an even stupider one his phone got an update that completely broke data access on the telus mobile network oh no problem i thought ill just go edit the apn settings and nope oneplus actually grays out these buttons making them impossible to click on the most ridiculous thing about this seemingly arbitrary interface decision is that the functions behind the grayedout buttons still work so the workaround for me was to use this thirdparty shortcut manager app to jump to those settings directly bypassing the grayedout button et viola the settings can be changed i mean come on even apple gives access to apn settings oneplus it is basic functionality like the wan hoodies super secure phone pocket get yours today at lttstorecom  i cant recommend putting one of these in it though since linus gave me this phone a year ago ive had my camera app refuse to open until i restart but then it breaks again the minute my kids do something cute ive also had problems with picture messages for three months before they finally patched that and probably the weirdest one was that i couldnt answer phone calls its intermittent so i couldnt catch it on camera but the green button to answer calls just wouldnt register which is pretty important for you know a phone they are losing me too i cant say ive ever had my actual phone app not work but ive got my own problems the most maddening one is the app switcher look at this if i go to click on the previous opened app it reopens the app i was just using instead of opening the app i clicked on i use the switcher dozens of times a day so if youre starting to notice gray hairs that could be it my ambient light sensor can take ages to adjust in dark areas and ive had camera problems too after the android 11 update i noticed that the images were being overprocessed to the point where pictures of my son looked like he had the life sucked out of him and i also noticed some odd fingerprint scanner behavior where it sometimes wont even pop up  of course every phone has bugs some of them lots so why are we picking on oneplus its because they promised to be something different and their fall from grace has left a hole both in the market and in our hearts bell dings okay as cheesy as that is were not the only ones who have noticed in early 2021 mkbhd uploaded a video titled what happened to oneplus his ultimate conclusion was that they didnt really change but rather they outgrew their initial role as the enthusiast focused flagship killer subbrand for parent company bbk he lamented their price creep and the design compromises that theyve made to appeal to the mainstream but he understood that business units have to be profitable and expressed a careful optimism about a potential return to form and he could still be right all the right ingredients are still there and many of their big announcements since then around pooling resources between oneplus and oppo have been yeah and moments for people like me who knew that cofounder pete laus previous role was as a vp at oppo and also that laughs they never really left oppo and oneplus are both subsidiaries of bbk so with all the pieces still in place and nothing really changed why are they struggling my diagnosis is that its a matter of focus oppo and oneplus phones have run similar hardware since day zero i mean bbks different brands are literally only separated by curtains on the production floor so it was always the software that set oneplus apart it was that obsessive attention to system responsiveness and to meaningful modifications to an otherwise mostly stock android experience so why has that changed well there was a leadership shake up and while neither has addressed the alleged conflict that caused fellow cofounder carl pei to leave he ended up founding his own company nothing it was pretty clear during the awkward transition period where mr lau gradually took on a more public facing role that the rift between them was a long time brewing if i had to guess what happened i would say it was probably over controversial ideas like merging oppos from my personal experience worst coloros software with oneplus really excellent oxygenos but as an outsider its hard to say for sure after all it is pete lau not carl pei who is credited with bringing cyanogenmod the clean mostly stock open source android skin that eventually became lineageos to oppo in the first place bottom line like marques im still rooting for them and there is tons of time left to write the ship but its clear that they need to get their head in the game especially when it comes to software and its clear that im gonna tell you about our sponsor

sometimes when things arent going to go right that will catch you on the blindside that you did not anticipate there are times when anything that can happen will happen murphys law will be knocking at your door see but the real challenge comes when you get knocked down thats where the growth takes place but i got a saying “when life knocks you down try and land on your back because if you can look up you can get up” youve got the power in you to do that youve got something special youve got combat power youll get knocked down but you wont be knocked out im unstoppable this will not get me down youll be able to get to your feet again be on the ropes that youll have a fast recovery rate when you work on yourself you’ve got to put your foot down and say “thats it enough is enough no longer am i going to listen to that voice inside my head telling me im nothing telling me im no good telling me im weak telling me im useless” fight against weakness against fear against time and against decay fight back go down swinging give every day everything youve got no more am i going to be this scared little kid inside my head and today and from every day after today im going to stop fighting back im going to start doing what i want to do with strength and pride im going to take on the world because thats what im capable of thats what im made to do thats whats inside me commitment it means taking a stand taking a stand for you it means delivering it means coming through when we put ourselves in the situation where we say were going to do it it puts you in another zone the universe responds to the man or woman that refuses to be denied that business that you want that book that what you want to write that dream that you have of controlling your destiny that is yours but youve got to be willing to stand there and face disappointment not have support be lonely doubt yourself sometimes be rejected again and again and again and refuse to turn around until life gives it up nothing can resist a person that has that kind of commitment wake up every single day thinking about how can i change my life how can i stand on a stage with the giants i started this homeless on the side of a turkey hill gas station and i told myself “i will not die here” i said “how can i build a milliondollar business with no money” a conscience in my head spoke to me and it said “purpose” they said “when you work for your purpose your purpose will begin to work for you and dreams and beautiful things will start to manifest” and i truly believe this as long as you believe in that very gift that you have in the bottom of your stomach that fire that burns that dream that wakes you up in the middle of the night and wakes you up and have you screaming to the sunrise so i can go after this dream that is the very thing that you should chase every single day if you chase this dream with consistency and you believe your booking and your calendar will fill up you want me to come to the middle of the projects im coming you want me to go where murderers sleep and live im coming you want me to fight that abusive husband that’s beating on you im coming i’m going to take drug dealers and turn them into community leaders im going to turn murderers into security im going to turn drug addict mothers back into beautiful queens im going to turn broken men into kings and im going to show them that everything you tried to hide god placed inside of me to tell the truth so when i say the kings are on the rise we are on the rise whatever you want out of your life its up to you to create because every human on this earth is born with this empty canvas and your life is what you paint theres nobody more special than anybody on this earth its just people thats willing to go down into the valley of nothingness the valley of darkness and come back with the sun its time that real comes to life thats why the world is falling in love with this motivation because its real you can feel it i can see it you can gain new knowledge because my motivation comes from my darkest days and when i realized that i was going to have to put on my hard hat and i was going to have to put on my boots and i was going to strap up and fight for this dream thats when things started to happen i told people i never wanted to be the man and the leader that stood in the front and everyone stood behind me i wanted to be a leader that everybody stood aside of me and we fought together and we wont sell our soul for a taste of a light bulb i dont care if you are that small boy sitting in the project halls i dont care if you are that girl that her mother treats her like trash and calls her names i dont care if you that young boy who never had a father to take them outside or throw a football i dont care if you are that father that they say is not a good father but they dont understand you never learned how to be a father you never learned how to love i want you to know that you are still something and as long as you got air in your lungs life in your body you can be anything you want to be you can be anything you want to be this is what we must do to take back our city this is what we must do to change this world we must come together collectively we must understand that these older cats have sold their soul to the devil for a dollar and they forgot about the babies at the bottom they never went back they left us we dont need you anymore but are you willing to die are you willing to sleep outside of their ceo office for an opportunity you see just getting to the opportunity is hard seizing the moment is a whole other monster so while you are fighting and you are clawing to get to the next level let me tell you something if you are a person out there buying… trying to buy your way to the top im going to let you know something king and queen you cant buy a legacy this you must earn so the big dogs they wont give you the opportunity you are going to have to take it you are going to sleep in your car you are going to sleep on that floor you are going to cry those tears but we are not going to be crybabies we are going to be lions you know when the lion is injured when the lion is bleeding it makes his moves and it keeps walking another thing i would advise against is looking too sharply at what other people are doing and ending up being a copycat of course youve got to imitate before you innovate but always with your own fingerprint always thinking in terms of “how am i going to bring something unique” my unique song my unique song my unique fingerprint my unique vibration how am i going to deliver that to the planet as a gift you are a gift every single one of us is a gift how are you going to exercise and share your gift reignite your soul by reigniting the spark in your body its definitely natural to do this sometimes the way it happens is based on unnatural cause but what happens is when you are in that stage in that time in my life it didnt make sense for me to be here because im in a going down process when you go up right im up im riding high and then you come down youre not going to start again at the same circle alright so youre not the same version of yourself you cant expect yourself to be who you were during the last cycle it won’t happen yet you have new experiences youre older your physiology changes all kinds of different habits but the ego like you referred to wants to attach to what was you had a great year last year but let it go because it’s no longer you are not that person anymore you got to allow yourself to go through whatever youre going through right now to reemerge on the right timetable as a stronger version of yourself just because summer ended doesn’t mean that you are supposed to come back up on that next circle you might still be going down failure is important you need failure in order to succeed it is the principle of death and rebirth it is the principle of catabolic and anabolic it is the principle of going down so that you can rise up done when you feel like your energy is all gone and its impossible to finish every assignment on time when you feel like youre mentally broken and your motivation to achieve is hard to find when you feel like the clouds in your life are so dark it would be impossible to ever see the sunshine again when you feel… those are three of the most powerful words that could ever be put together when you feel… because to feel means youre still with us because to feel means youre still breathing because to feel means you still have an opportunity to be achieving because to feel means that you still have the power to stop the pain stop the bleeding stop the hurting stop the grieving i said when you feel because to feel means youre still with us because to feel means youre still breathing because to feel means you still have an opportunity to be achieving because to feel means that you still have the power to stop the pain still have the power to stop the bleeding still have the power to stop the hurting you still have the power to stop the grieving so whenever you feel like your professor or teacher has lost their mind because theyre overwhelming you with a workload that seemingly will take up all of your time i need you to pause and recall the reason why you made the choice to invest your time and never lose sight of the fact that you are destined to shine never lose sight of the fact that you were made for this grind never lose sight of the fact that no hole is too deep for you to climb up out of and above all else your “why” will never ever allow you to withdraw your “why” will never ever allow you to pull the plug your “why” will never ever allow you to throw in the towel see its your “why” that will push you to dig deeper and go that extra mile see not only do you owe yourself but you told your mama you will finish you told your daddy you will finish you told your brother you will finish you told your sister you will finish so therefore its up to you to never diminish the value of your work and a wise man once gave me a wise word and now im passing these wise words onto you you are in total control of your situation so when you feel like youre facing a breaking point this is the point when you go to your professor this is the point when you go to your academic adviser and not the time to despise her and not the time to despise him simply say “i am in this until i walk across the stage with my diploma i am in this until i smell the sweet aroma of success here right now im feeling overwhelmed because i am on academic overload do you have any suggestions that will help me power through this semester because my only option is to figure this out and whatever it takes… i can i will and i must do see i understand that drastic times call for drastic measures and the measure of a persons will is determined by what they are willing to do to ensure a triumph over tragedy the measure of a persons will is determined by what they are willing to do to ensure success over failure the measure of a persons will is determined about what they are willing to do to ensure winning over losing and see right now im choosing to fight for my academic future and thats why i came to your office i promise when they see that your passion is pushing you with a purpose they will give you every ounce of their being to assure you are successful because they know youre worthy i just need you to never forget that youre worthy success is your baby you just gotta birth it and then kick back and enjoy the fruits of your labor but in the meantime i need you to pull up your sleeves i need you to tighten up your boxing gloves because youre right in the middle of a heavyweight boxing match and life is trying to take your title and your survival and this academic arena is at stake its moments like these where we separate the real from the fake but when its like you shake off any and every punch that life throws and fight back with a series of vicious head shots and body blows to overcome and achieve the victory but believe you me life will keep testing believe you me life will keep trying you believe you me life will keep pushing you believe you me life will keep trying to break you i dont think you heard me i said believe you me life will keep testing you believe you me life will keep trying you believe you me life will keep pushing you believe you me life will keep trying to break you and always remember you are unbreakable they want to see you fail but you are a diamond and you succeed because you get back up after you fail and you will get back up again and again until your arms are raised with the win so i need you to speak positivity into existence and ignore your inner voice of resistance because its your resilience and persistence that will allow you to master your time management skills that will allow you to break all of these huge assignments down into small pieces that will allow you to group study with a winners circle that will allow you to jump over any and i mean any academic hurdles always remember when you feel that means you are still breathing and thus you have an opportunity to keep achieving this is a great day to win when you come to a crossroad and run into the winner and the quitter in you listen to the winner the quitter will never take you down the road you want to travel i believe we all have a winner inside of us theres a winner inside of you sometimes weve just been hanging around with losers for too long develop the mindset of a winner the truth is most people give up on their dream most people give up on their dream to live the average lifestyle but it really doesnt matter what most people do what do you do because you are different you will never give up on your dream you will not listen to the average you will listen to the winner inside of you you will believe in yourself when no one else does you will believe in yourself when you have no reason to believe and you will never quit i know some of you are going through a rough time some of you are going into the fight of your life fighting for your future fighting for your career fighting for your family some of you are fighting for your life and i am telling you do not quit do not give in i know life can be tough i know life can wear you down but if you just stick it out even if you dont get the result you will find the character your show will be your reward the fighting spirit you develop will be the reward and it will serve you well for the rest of your life fight for what you want now a fighter gets what you dont want later you choose dont you dare quit   dont you dare settle dont you dare back down not today or any other day when the tough moments come never forget you are in that moment writing your legacy in that tough moment you are setting the standard for your character do you have the character you do fight for what you want now a fighter gets what you dont want later you choose fight for what you want now a fighter or get what you dont want later you choose when you come to a crossroad and run into the winner and the quitter in you you listen to the winner when you make a commitment to yourself you make sure you see it through never ever quit so be the type of person thats willing to fight give your blood sweat and tears for what you believe in and understand a legacy can never be bought let me tell you why you cant buy a legacy see the most i have to give is this dynamic gift this gift is so amazing i mean this gift that the whole world wants to buy but he makes us work for them he makes us grind he makes us feel the pain of the process and for me i would say id rather have it no other way see we get a lot of people that throw all these big conferences throw all these big amazing events and what i realized is you pay 10000 but the most highest the only thats going to give you the day that says “its time for you to be great its time for you to be phenomenal” see many of us like to skip the hard part we like to skip the stages that make us the great people that we are born to be les brown has a saying “live full and die empty” and thats what i live by i realized that you have to be willing to sleep outside of that office for your opportunity you must be willing to go down to the shelter and eat those canned goods for your opportunity you must be willing to almost die for your dream and you must realize that you cannot buy this no one can give you this you must earn this i play the game as if my life is on the line and individuals all over the world that understand this very thing greatness lies in the man that believes it’s in them so all those books all those manuals everything youre looking at youre going to realize one day when you’re standing on that stage when youre standing at that altar when youre standing at that place of greatness youre going to remember you’re going to understand that everything i needed was inside of me everything i needed was inside of me now if you turned your back on me i promise ill make you turn around you will call me king you will call me king

wFqQm1541aA,teaching in the us vs the rest of the world,Education,this is anna she just graduated from college in the united states and this is sophia she also just graduated from college in finland anna and sophia both want to be middle school teachers but it turns out theres a good chance their experiences will be very different so different that anna is twice as likely as sophia to leave teaching for good thats causing a problem the supply of new certified teachers in the united states is shrinking but the number of public school students keeps growing massive teacher shortages warnings about teacher turnover educators call colorados teacher shortage a crisis so what makes sophia stay and anna leave and how can the united states keep more of its teachers in the classroom in the us teachers work about nine and a quarter hours a day thats an hour and a half longer than the average for teachers in other countries in the organization for economic development or oecd for short thats a group of mostly wealthy countries that economists often compare to one another teachers in the us work more than two and a half hours longer than their colleagues in south korea finland and israel there are some countries with similar teacher work hours to the united states like new zealand singapore and the uk teachers in japan for example work nearly two hours more per day than teachers in the us but in all of these countries teaching hours are much lower of the nine and a quarter hours that american teachers work every day they spend about five and a half of those hours actually teaching thats more than the oecd average and significantly more than teachers in new zealand the uk south korea japan and singapore teachers in these countries get more time for planning grading and collaborating with each other so do all those extra teaching hours translate to better results students in the us score slightly above the oecd average on the pisa exam which tests 15 yearolds all over the world in reading science and math but they score lower than students in countries like finland south korea japan and singapore where teaching hours are much lower if we look inside anna and sofias classrooms in the us and finland wed see anna teaching an hour and a half more per day than sofia anna also spends more time planning lessons grading student work and leading extracurricular activities but those extra hours arent necessarily reflected in annas paycheck if you compare sofia to other people in finland with college degrees she makes about 98 cents for every dollar that they make thats on par with the pay ratio between teachers and college graduates in similar countries but anna and other american middle school teachers only make about 65 cents for every dollar that their collegeeducated peers make still as politicians in the us never tire of pointing out we spend more per student than almost any country i think than nearly every other country in the developed world but that figure varies a lot by state new york spends twice as much as california on each student mississippi spends less than half as much as alaska and american schools generally spend a lot more on security and other noninstructional costs than schools in other countries plus if you look at the share of its national wealth or gdp that each country spends on education you can see there are plenty of countries spending a bigger share than the us theres one other difference between anna and sofia when theyre asked whether people in their country value teachers two out of three finnish teachers say yes but just one in three american teachers agree there are a lot of reasons why teachers like anna leaves a classroom but if the us wants to keep more of them around we might want to take a few pages from finlands book you
pp-zw4ykOpw,testing a 5 course menu in an air fryer  sorted food,Food,upbeat music  hello and welcome to the channel now you guys have been asking us to test air fryers for ages so today we have teamed up with instant brands who have sent us one of their machines and challenged us to create an epic five course meal using your suggestions so myself and the food team have had a proper play with this for a few weeks to get to grips with it but todays the first time that our normal home cooks are getting their hands on it  five courses in one video  five courses in one meal sounds about right upbeat music im just gonna use my chefy intuition and say pané station  ben yep so were gonna make croquettes so spanish in approach and method but were gonna mix up the flavors to use some other global influences youve got a béchamel sauce in front of you which is really thick and then cooled  jamie thats a shortcrust pastry laughs  ben divide it by two so put half into the big bowl with two other flavors charred corn and jalapeno and then the remaining half can be mixed with dukkah and sultana  ive never handled a béchamel sauce  no laughs  ben and once youve done that were gonna double pané them so back through egg and breadcrumbs the reason being theyre going to have the cooking in the air fryer across eight minutes rather than maybe three or four in a deep fat fryer and therefore theyll have chance to expand the heat up you dont want em to pop so its gonna give you the extra bit of security while youre finishing off your balls if one of you have got a relatively clean hand you can preheat the air fryer so select air fryer 205 degrees eight minutes on one of the drawers and then just sync cook and itll automatically put the second drawer at exactly the same when it gets the temperature it will tell you to load the drawers you can put one flavor in one drawer and one flavor in the other  this is completely alien to me ive never used an air fryer before i hear about it everywhere so im still trying to work it out  yeah ive never air fried before  ben so essentially its a heating element at the top and then a fan that pushes that hot air down onto the food so it tends to cook quicker but its not submersed in the oil so its a little bit healthier one flavor in one drawer give them an oil spray and the other flavor in the other drawer  so theyre going on a rack thats raised theyre like in the middle of the oven so they get air all around  yeah so the the fan is basically gonna spray and circulate that hot air  and then it automatically starts timing down  while youre waiting for it you can make a super simple dip  oh hello  so you could make a dip or you could get some chefs to put all the ingredients in a bowl on im guessing we are going to  were gonna make a five course meal and i dont wanna be here all day i know what you two are like so what youve got is yogurt mayonnaise mustard lemon juice lemon zest salt and pepper  stir your own dip you stir the dip  ben the perfect dip that will work with both charred corn and jalapeño and our sultana and dukkah  get a nice sense of achievement there  ben yeah  laughing upbeat electronic music  ben serve them up  barry that was not a lot of time and they are very hot and crispy  jamie laughter  ben garnish with some fresh herbs and you got your dipping sauce to go upbeat electronic music  cheers  cheers  woo  that béchamel has gone lovely and gooey  ben gooey on the béchamel i can hear the crunch  jamie thats got the magic combo of gooey middle and crispy outside im a fan of that  as a five course meal were off to a banging start i just realized were gonna eat every course when we go along  yeah you dont have to eat all of every course  we are upbeat electronic music  so one of the suggestions was that a toasted cheese sandwich or a grilled cheese works wonders in an air fry  ooh yes  ben and there was also people saying they used them just to reheat things so we thought lets combine the two with french onion soup so in this instance youre gonna use the drawers for different things drawer one is going to be on reheat 140 degrees celsius and drawer number two is gonna be on bake at 160 for six minutes so variable control and variable temperatures and in the reheat drawer youre gonna spoon your french onion soup into your dishes and reheat them whilst you bake the croûtes in the other side  obviously weve got a fancy air fryer thats got dual drawers in it would you just do this one after the other these processes if you had a standard singledrawer one  ben yeah the fact that this has kind of got the six cooking functions essentially its adjusting the temperature at which it operates so for the reheat lower temperature you can reheat your soup then you can once its up to temperature you could bake off your croûtes and finally once both of those are done grate the cheese add it onto the croûte add the croûte onto the soup and then grill at a higher temperature for less time  onions have been reheated  ben and the beauty about this particular dish is it now goes soggy on the bottom from the onion soup and kind of crispy around the edges but also the molten cheese that we love of a grilled cheese on top and then were going to grill it at 200 and whilst we wait we can make a lovely french salad to go with it which is cornichon all chopped up mixed with mustard vinegar and then toss that through with some fresh watercress  barry this grill is like mega intense the thing with my like oven at home it takes a while to grill to heat up and its a big oven and thats not a very big dish it seems to be more focused  focused and obviously youve got the fan which is pushing the hot air directly onto it  that does look a little bit special  it does upbeat electronic music  ben dig in  jamie oh  barry oh cheesy onion goodness  oh  stunning  i love french onion soup because the richness and the indulgence of it the beefiness and the cheesiness so dont have soup and a grilled cheese on the side  cook a grilled cheese in your soup  yes  happy  did you eat my crouton  was that yours i sorry laughs upbeat electronic music  nibbles soup course  fish course  ooh  ben really excited for this one this is combining lots of different suggestions its gonna start with roasting asparagus so preheat one of the drawers to roast at 200 degrees celsius for six minutes and as soon as its preheated you can whack the asparagus all you need to do is give it a quick spritz of oil and theyll roast in there in six minutes super simple so its pretty good for roasting all sorts of veg but there was one suggestion for barbecue seasoned asparagus and what i thought was i quite like the idea of doing asparagus but were gonna mix up the flavors to take it to india  okay  ben because the second suggestion was something like fish fingers so were gonna make ourselves indianinspired fish fingers by taking salmon coating it in egg white and corn flour and then dipping it into smashed up bombay mix  barry and im guessing does the bombay mix almost like protect the fish from the heat a bit more then  yes and in the same breath dont forget its already been fried so whereas the first course we had dry breadcrumbs that we had to spray with oil anything you buy thats already been fried fish fingers chicken nuggets chicken dippers anything thats already been fried is ideal in here because the fat on the thing sizzles  are we just doing a single dip  ben yep single dip on this just to coat it and then you can preheat your second drawer to air fry 205 degree celsius four minutes  205 feels really hot  205 is definitely hotter than if you were doing oil you would have it at maybe 180 190 at a push before you start getting to a smoke point of oil here youve got the fierce heat which is why four minutes is enough  barry look at that  ben give it a little sort of mix up on the plate with some of that aubergine pickle  barry what you doing  he said laughs  ben i just kind of meant just zhoosh it up  ive just zhooshed it up  ben to cut through the oily fish and the spice of the pickle a little yogurt raita youve got cucumber fresh mint all the ingredients there zhooshyzhoosh  oh  ben and with a bit of luck four minutes at 205 we should have bain que which means literally just cooked so you have the salmon inside thats just on the edge  hes got it no oh its great  ben why did you sound so surprised  teamwork  look at us upbeat electronic music plays  oh youve just got a little bit ofhere we go  right what you reckon  oh  as you said ebbers perfectly al dente cheers  weve panéed with bread crumb weve panéed with crisps why have we never panéed with bombay mix before  does all the hard work for you and because its already been fried it is a wonderful even golden brown in the fryer and i think the asparagus roasting is super quick and then you can toss it through any dressing for the summer  well its nice but you got little charred black bits and usually it takes quite a long time in oven to get that char and by that point they sometimes can be quite dry  fancy a meat course  thought youd never ask upbeat electronic music plays  ben so were thinking roast chicken roast potatoes and a romesco sauce start with a romesco roast setting 205 degrees eight minutes in drawer one and then if you push sync function itll just copy paste it across while its preheating you can halve and deseed your peppers weve done some of them for you  you said some of them you mean all of them but one  all of them but one  all right see if you can get it done before it preheats  jamie not falling for your little game ebbers  ben so once its preheated and asks you to add in your food were basically gonna add half the peppers into each drawer a spritz of oil on both and then cook them so in those eight minutes we should get some nice roasted peppers and halfway through its obviously gonna remind you in case you want to turn it you might wanna take it out and shake it you can rip up the bread because essentially once those peppers have roasted you are going to add in the bread the almonds the garlic for another two minutes of roasting and then you can tip it all out into your bowl and blitz in the stick blender along with olive oil and sherry vinegar once weve done our sauce we are gonna use the drawers to do two different things chicken thighs in one and roasted rosemary potatoes in the other  yes  ben so different times and temperatures for each you can oil salt and pepper your spuds  barry oh yes  ben the machines gonna do some maths for you  its your dream isnt it  ben so drawer one set to roast at 180 for 25 minutes thats gonna be for your potatoes and drawer two set to air fry at 205 for 20 minutes so different functions different temperatures and different times if you now push sync finished and then push start  okay so one is starting before the other so theyre both finished the exact same time  ben yeah  nice  ben and it knows how long its gonna take to preheat so when drawer one is preheated enough itll tell you to add your potatoes itll also remind you to shake them halfway through itll also start drawer two at the right time to get to the right temperature to tell you to put your second thing in and again to turn it halfway now in your second drawer when it is ready youre just gonna put four chicken thighs so many people said youve got to do chicken wings in an air fryer and we did do them theyre absolutely brilliant but not ideal for this dish to serve this way but the same logic  were not adding any other seasonings any flavors  you can season the skin if you wish but essentially no added oil cause youre using the natural fat from the chicken skin so something like a chicken wing anything thats already got that fat all we need to do is keep an eye on the machine cause itll tell you when to add stuff when to turn over or toss stuff but in the meantime six tablespoons oil and two tablespoons of sherry vinegar into your roasted stuff and blitz to a sauce machines beeping at you  barry hello add food add food  ben get your chicken in last minute cooking toss your rosemary in with your potatoes  personally the thing that appeals to me is the size of that like especially if i was just cooking a small meal for austin like just one of those i cook a whole meal with that for him  jamie yeah  barry and its done and he eats separately to us sometimes as well  jamie yeah  number four a midweek roast done  its pretty easy  that was that was the easier so far  wow upbeat electronic music  i remember we used to share out the food so that people on the side got to eat some too i missed that  you havent done any cooking yeah you havent done any cooking  ben dig in  barry bang  jamie mm  i mean its simple food but its simple food done well right  barry theres not much better in the world than a roast potato  jamie op see there you go juices everywhere  woah yeah the is juicy  that was so simple  that was this is all chicken flavor nothing else  the most complicated thing we did on that plate isnt on the plate it was the sauce and id be happy just to serve that chicken and potatoes  some mayonnaise  mayonnaise i wouldnt even make it ebbers it was coming straight from the squeezy bottle and that would be perfect  and thats why we have normals and why we have chefs  how sweet are we going ebbers  so many comments suggested donuts have to be tried in air fryer cause if youre doing fried food donuts is a classic dessert but rather than bobbing around in oil were gonna do them here so youve got a dough its already been kneaded and proved once you can cut out little disks so this is an enrich dough close to brioche in this instance were gonna cut out little discs and the second proof happens in the machine  this is the first recipe so far where id say i would never even attempt to make this in a traditional oven it had to be fried  ben the machine has a dehydrate function which is great for like sliced fruit or half cherry tomatoes you can basically dry your own bits and pieces but we are gonna use it as a proving drawer  so hang on a second this isnt like a proving function  ben its that proving temperature at 54 youll kill the yeast you wanna take it down to as low as it go about 35 so what youve got there are ones that we have preproved in the draw already you can see the difference between the unproved and the very pillowy proved ones now two things are gonna happen in draw one preheat to air fry for your donut so 205 degree celsius four minutes and in draw two youre going to do a reheat function 120 degrees celsius for eight minutes youre gonna mix white chocolate marshmallow and whipping cream this is gonna be an excellent dipping sauce  barry this feels naughty  jamie it does feel really naughty  ben but because its going in a gentle reheat function its slowly gonna melt the chocolate melt the marshmallows the cream and then we can stir it all together once its done and in draw one once youve preheated youre going to very carefully lift up and pop your donuts onto the rack spray them and then theyll need four minutes and this will be the big difference really between donut and brioche because its a sweet and rich dough and youre gonna cook it in the air fryer you need to add some oil to the top so that you get some sizzle and even golden brown weve also given you some caster sugar and some cinnamon which you can combine cause the moment those donuts are done youre gonna wanna toss them in the cinnamon sugar  hey ooh well okay  ben straight into the sugar while its nice and hot zhoosh zhoosh zhoosh and get your next four in baz  barry they look more like dough balls upbeat electronic music  oh st sorry  laughter sorry ebbers  ben donuts and dippy sauce  barry tell you what cause he is been so lovely this whole video should we give him a donut  im gonna say no upbeat electronic music  ben have a dunk can i have one ive been ive been so patient all this yes  jamie so the outside of the donut is not as crisp as it would be if it had been fried in the traditional manner its a slightly different texture but the inside is just as fluffy as youd want it to be  and im not even gonna start to presume that these or anything weve done today is healthy inverted comments but it is using like 95 less oil which also means you havent got that vat of oil you have to get rid of once its been used  before doing this i assumed air fryer was a replacement for a deep fat fryer actually today the ones that have jumped out to me are the the chicken and the asparagus in terms of i can relate that can intense direct heat from a fan and get in that char and keeping that tender juices inside as well smart  the peppers from the romesco sauce how quickly they cooked and started to char in the air fryer that to me was a favorite bit and i think these although slightly different texture on the outside to normal donuts theyre spectacular i know this machine is more of a fancier air fryer with lots of other functionality as well but im really interested to try more air frying just as a general cooking method yeah its opened a whole new world to me  question for you guys which of those five courses did you prefer or what do you cook at home in your air fryer comment down below  and a massive thank you to instant brands for teaming up with us on this video if you wanna find out more information about them and a cheeky little discount all the information is down below  we locked eyes  i know we all the right time yeah yeah ben would that be the  i jumped laughter  laughter
8N5wssPlSdE,the jankiest extreme gaming setup  intel 5000 extreme tech upgrade,Tech,camera smashes  oohoh  were back with another intel extreme tech upgrade and this time we are gonna be laserfocused intel has provided our cameraman david with 5000 us and he has decided to laserfocus his budget on ultimate media enjoyment extreme gaming streaming and data hoarding how on earth did you do all of that within this budget  its not even close to the budget  this is a 2500 us webcam upbeat music relaxing upbeat music david can i just say that you are a man after my own heart youve got the sick watercooled gaming rig and what appears to be a leftover piece of two leftover pieces laughing of hardie board that make up your desk because if it doesnt contribute to performance  why would i spend any money on it  thank you you finished my sentence also can i just say for a moment that i love your flacid handles here  oh yeah if i ever feel emasculated i just come over here i feel better about myself  i gotta say david this is one hell of an lmg beep mix special right here i recognize pretty much all of these parts laughing you got that old weird zotac 1080 ti like mini thing  david yeah  and then that inwind comentered well under  david i got that from ncix  thats right we did we brought in a bunch of them for like 60 bucks  david thats why i got it it was so cheap  so you probably paid next to nothing for it  david yep  thats why i recognized it  david yeah thats the glitter case from ltx whenever  oh so it is so it is  david not much glitter left though  theres no way youre changing this keyboard though right  its a great keyboard i wanna go wireless i couldnt fit the 915 tkl on my budget but my birthday is coming up so i might buy it for myself  g43 great bang for the buck but youre going g pro arent you  david g pro x baby  super light power yeah lets go have a look at his hall i mean i guess this kind of makes the point of how much space this has been taking up in your house for weeks now laughing its taken us a little while to get davids rig on the schedule so hes just had to have this sitting staring at him including an rtx 3080 so why dont we go through the highlights the rtx 3080 is one of the things in your intel 5k budget right  david yes absolutely  along with the pro x mouse powerplay mouse pad a define 7xl computer case that youre gonna be turning into a rocking nas how much storage are you gonna have and why do you need it  its gonna be about 20 terabytes and i need it because i want to do more streaming and make more videos but the last time i did it i ran out of ssd space so quickly and i just started moving stuff around on ssds and it was a pain and i just got too tired and never finished the video  okay fair enough so were going with ironwolf nas drives for that why do we need this much water cooling gear  i already have a watercooled system but this system will also be watercooled  good lord youre watercooling your nas or more accurately im watercooling your nas  laughing all the problems are handed off  naturally for the nas were going intel with a core i3 10100 k this has four cores eight threads which like damn i3s have gotten good  yeah seriously  obviously plenty for a nas and then its easy to miss because its covered in other stuff but how the hell did you get a 48 inch lgc 10 oled into the budget  magic money baby  so if you guys havent figured it out yet david contributed some of his own funds to this complete tech makeover meaning that this is going to take us a while  yeah you can build a computer in 17 minutes cant you  this is water cooling though and we have to do maintenance on his existing watercooled rig to put the new card in and i havent even shown you guys the custom tabletop that david and nicholas finished up last night  david yeah  thats gonna be replacing this is a necessary upgrade dude this looks so nice  right its gonna be awesome what im thinking is we take down the setup there we can put the wood on this table you can start building computers there  yes  ill then build the legs get the table ready and then we can transfer all the building into there get it all done  while were at it you want me to paint any walls  yeah that one up there sounds pretty good  oh man like this mouse pad david laughing there has got to be like three pounds of dead skin in the surface  david oh at least thats been through a washing machine  oh really david laughing  yeah i have dirty hands  linus this is gonna look absolutely sick  oh i know im so excited  andy oh did you just use book  yeah so its a bunch of harry potter books but then my high school year books im gonna put those away before linus finds them  whats that wait a minute is that what was propping up your desk  yep just harry potter books  wait what other books were there oh my god david laughing  david oh no  linus yeah that is like a bull mullet  yeah its bad  wait where the heck is the tv going  on the wall i have a wall now  like in there  yeah  thats your gaming display  yeah i would say i have the sickest setup of anyone ever its gonna be so bonkers  okay all right well lets do it then so weve got an rtx 3080 basically freaking top of the line for davids rig here this ones pretty unique it can actually do up to three hdmi outputs and up to three display port 14s and of course because its water blocked we are going to be maximum turbo all the time but weve got a bit of a problem david  david okay  so i thought this was gonna be relatively simple pop out the old card pop the new one in but who built this water cooling setup for you  me and ivan together and john and ed we were all there  okay well you guys hooked up your cpu block backwards  oops laughing  and also this is zip tied why is this zip tied  david zip ties faster its better  linus is this mismatched tubing david  uh huh i have more tubing though so we can use that if you want and lots more fittings  oh god oh boy  david i have two pets and lots of carpets so thats probably like five days worth of dust  i cannot see through it this is gonna be tough ive got five hours to fix this water cooling and build a completely separate watercooled system to get an idea of what standard of quality the client expects all you really have to do is take a look at their own workmanship thats around you david laughing so im thinking the bar is gonna be pretty low here  so i bought these prime cable the lshaped desk legs i want to be able to adjust theres like a sweet spot of like up high leaning forward where i have optimal speed reflexes gun firing  you want me to put that new radiator in hey  david yeah if you can thatd be awesome  you dont happen to have any like hardware for that rad do you  yeah i had a bag of screws its a bit of a mix i got the radiators from the office but they didnt come with hardware so i was like i better get some screws for this video  and did you just grab a handful of random  sure did  i could have helped you find the correct  it wouldnt be a good video if it wasnt a challenge  most of these arent even threaded right for this its a good thing any screw is a selftapper if you press hard enough  heck yeah i am not the most handy person so this is gonna be a challenge and a half but im gonna do my best full credit to alpha cool for the quality of their materials but im having a real hard time here my screws are stripping as i try to kind of self tap them into these smaller holes and theyre getting stuck this thing is solid boys  oh yeah  watch your step ouch  youre okay  yeah i hit the wall im fine my butts very paddy what an improvement  its a little bit nicer  all right now i just got to figure out how to get that radiator in there im considering drilling the radiator drill whirring it shouldnt be that hard  im gonna need a longer bit  linus i dont understand it  using something not meant to go on a drill but its the only one thats gonna work  just go in your home drill whirring  nice this is gonna work  this is not going well now my torx bit is stuck in the screw im trying to use to tap it  making progress drill whirring  oh god  david oh oh drill whirring  its all good  okay hey thats okay thanks nick youre my favorite nick callanan at the office  nice four screws thats all hes getting  i got the autonomous myochair which is the cheapest ergo chair they make this is really comfortable i can feel the lumbar support ill be definitely a little bit more back ill feel like the world of warcraft south park meme  whoever put this fitting in here was trying to be some kind of hero  in typical david fashion it seems that i have lost the screws that mount the monitor to this so im gonna have to try a bunch of different screws see if i have any thatll fit  god thats why its so tight whoever put this on used like pliers to tighten it on you could see the teeth marks  i got so lucky the first screw that i grabbed from a random thing seems to work  linus how nice for you david laughing  oh i forgot i have to build a shelf  linus david i hate your rig its killing me  what do you think of my fancy shelf that im building  its wonderful and im glad its going much better than what im doing  everyone knows you shouldnt put your electronics on carpet and i have two pets  linus wait a minute i didnt actually look closely at this this is your shelf  for underneath its gonna be on the ground so i can fit my feet underneath it wire manage underneath it and then have all my computers and consoles on top  you had said earlier that you dont consider yourself very handy  this is why its so simple  you know what no you know what i love it your pumps in with the new cards not a mini card david  is it not gonna fit it fits look just shove it shove it harder its cool i thought i chose a piece of lumber that was pretty straight but i had it flipped the other way and there was like an inch gap on this one so  this goes to show you can take david out of the junky setup but you cant take the junky setup out of david youre having fun over there  im having a great time am i doing a good job  he starts with like the nicest looking pile of awesome stuff and then makes a shelf out of two by 10  this is a camera that i had when i was a freelancer and its a great camera its the black magic ursa 46k its got a great sensor great dynamic range but its really not well suited to be a webcam  2000 webcam my brain hurts all the way from the other room just listening to them  these are spherical but theyre seven years old they were built in east berlin during the cold war like zeiss flektogons  yeah cinematic webcam then  you wanna know why this isnt wellsuited to be a webcam multiple reasons one not a good low light sensor two no autofocus number three i have to open this and then reach in here and turn it on reason four this monitor doesnt flip around so i have to have an external monitor on top reason five its heavy as beep stupid and so much work to use this but im probably the only person in the entire world using an ursa to stream so thats pretty cool  i ran out of tubing if david wants this to be the ghettoest sick rig ever then im gonna embrace it there you go david this is what you want  david i love it  there you go im glad this is coming together but it makes me really unhappy  ive installed the shelf underneath in order to get it over the radiator i flipped the support sideways and now its really tall and im worried that the computers wont fit underneath the table unless i raised the table up to an uncomfortable level i feel like a little baby like camera crashes oh keep rolling thats the danger its gotta be at balance i dont have its pretty junk  for better or for worse its done but before we take the rig back into the computer room i want to at least hey david  david yeah  you got a vacuum  david yeah  i wouldnt know it before i use your vacuum to clean your computer i might need to clean your vacuum vacuum cleaner whirring ah okay it like does not come off maybe if i can grab some of the fibers i can actually pull a lot of the dust out its all about improvement at this point hey david  david yeah  i think ive got enough hair to make another dog so thats where you want it in the corner there  yeah thats the idea i think for today i might put another plank of wood on the ground and then just have both computers on the ground right now the tables really high to be able to fit it and i dont really want the table that high  i think this is the part where the video is supposed to include some justification for why you chose this particular tv  i mean its pretty selfexplanatory its the best computer monitor slash gaming tv money can buy right now  there you go  in 20 hertz hdmi 21 its oled  okay lets make sure we get the peel on the back of this one i accidentally left andys on and it turns out that its actually needed for cooling david youre an absolute mad lad man  david why is that  why do you need water cooling in your nas  david i want top performance for those hard drives were watercooling the hard drives too right  were starting with six you know that the radiators are gonna reduce like your hard drive capacity though right  david yeah  you know you dont need two triple radiators though right  oh man i wanna push that 10100 so hard i know it doesnt overclock but im gonna push it  linus okay are you messing with me  not even a little bit  hey david what are you using the one terabyte m2 for  david oh its going in the other one  oh the reason for that is while the 665p is a really awesome drive its kind of too awesome for the nas so what we want to do is just put a sata drive in as a cache and then ah yes this one and then well throw this in the main gaming rig so oops anyway were running an asrock b460 steel legend motherboard we didnt need anything super crazy because were not gonna be overclocking or anything like that and this puppy has got a solid mix of decent vrm good expansion and well we dont actually need a ton of io but  david 25 gig though  does it have 25 gig ram on it  david yeah it does  oh thats why we picked it as for our i3 10100 this is on the surface pretty overkill for a nas if all david wants is 25 gigabit transfers from his desktop over to his mass storage ray in here but if you wanted it to pull double duty as say for example a plex media server or in his case as a capture pc then its looking like a pretty good choice question for you were you intending to throw that 1080 ti in here to use nvenc  yes  i see thats why it needs to be watercooled you were just messing with me before  were gonna have a bit of challenge with the amount of pcie lanes that we have and kind of the slots so were gonna do capture card graphics card and then for the hba were gonna have to do nvbme to pcie 4x to a riser card as you wait no i dont know thats gonna go in there linus is gonna figure out its gonna be great  heres a little trick  david i know it can do that but wont it lessen the performance  youre plugging into hard drives  its fine okay  now my cp water block im apparently salvaging that from your old system  david yeah 7700 k  i asked david im like hey you were there for andys shoot is yours gonna be like relatively quick hes like oh yeah laughter in the background  i might need linus help because where we thought the stud was the drill is not drill whirring oh im going backwards im a frigging moron drill whirring  linus its extreme tech upgrade beep more like extreme tech overly ambitious employees  this tables big its in my way oh gee mikala can i get a hand for a second you can take your mask off cause we live together  we do  oh  holy beep we stripped it  were not even a tech show anymore were practically like a couples home reno show now oh no we stripped it you went single channel memory  david it was the cheapest one in the world  it was the cheapest one and you had a budget i guess well the good news is that you can always add another stick of this  david yeah thats the plan  and then you can up it to 32 gigs later  i didnt even realize it was single channel but here we are  you know what david its the least junky thing about this setup what is this optical drive for  david you never know when youre gonna have to burn a ps3 game  you know that this case does not have a 5 14 inch bay right  david it doesnt yeah then thats fine ill use it for a different build  oh my god its so thought out and yet insane its carefully all kind of wrong  mikala welcome to my life david laughing  mikala before i tighten it do you want to check the levelness you dont think that a taco truck is open in front of  the good news is that now that i have mounting hardware im making some serious progress over here weve got the rear fan in weve got the motherboard mounted ready to put our gpu in i had to actually put the gpu away i put it in the box for the new one thinking oh well hes gonna sell this on ebay but no that is in fact not the plan its gonna be handling nvencing coding for his capture vm i guess  david yeah  im supposed to be out of here in like an hour and a half tops  oh beep im sorry  no worry i got this i got this  david is there no way we can have anyone else on windshield  wheres my 120 millimeter fans  you dont need to plug in rgb im gonna turn it off anyway  neat youre getting one radiator david  the tvs on im pretty excited about this mobility when i sit over there i can tilt the monitor this way or at my desk i can have it more this way and theres actually enough thickness of the desk that i think ill be able to like play mouse and keyboard games at the desk which i wasnt expecting yeah its im so lucky thank you mikala if youre watching this video i love you  meanwhile in linus land the nuts for the mounting brackets for the reservoir are missing fortunately there were a couple of random nuts in the random baggy of hardware that david got so weve got that taken care of but in other bad news this mounting clip immediately broke so were down to one i make no apologies for the junkyness of the solution  david give me junk  youre bearing witness to this andy  david and it looks fine  wait do you not recognize the problem  david nope  its killing me too andy but im in a hurry and clearly the client doesnt care so were adjusting our standards  depending on the device i have yeah its my 21 to go to ps5 and to the pc 20 to go to my headphones which are gonna run off arc 20 to go to the capture pc so thats gonna be the pass through and im hoping that all my retro consoles can go through the capture station with zero input lag and all go through one input into the tv and it should be easy  hey david  david yes  this hard drive cage here is it even part of this case  david nope  weve got another problem the plastic sleds that are intended to go into these hard drive cages are apparently not here weve got these ones that mount in the front so we can put two hard drives in today oh i need screws to just line up for me today  linus if im being honest the thing im most excited about today is this playstation three  linus what  this is the ps3 i bought at launch and its the one that has the ps2 chip on it so it can actually play ps1 ps2 games without emulation and output it for adp this was dead for 10 years and it seems to be revived but i havent  linus what  i havent plugged it in and fully tested it so there was a little bit up in the air but were gonna find out today  linus oh nice  im so excited  meanwhile im trying to figure out how the hell im gonna finish this watercooled computer oh wow you went all out on the capture card  oh yeah  dang live gamer 4k get that hdr  david also record and stream at the same time like two separate applications so thats a big reason why i want that one  how do i want to tackle the one oh my god i havent put the pump in yet  i picked the sony whl600s because theyre wireless which is what i want i wanna be able to move around this room but they connect through hdmi theyve got zero latency its not bluetooth its radio mikala oh yeah daisy came over here because she was excited to see you one thing that was exciting to me is that it comes with this base station like i said it can do optical but it also does arc which is what i really want and aux so i can actually connected to a pc separately from the tv why i really want arc is that everything is going to the tv in hdmi and then one connection back to this means literally every device in this room can connect to these wireless headphones no problem  wow this is sick  its not super stable so be careful  oh gosh  this is a great moment in history or historical failure wait oh is this thing giving me trouble oh i think somethings wrong it did better before dang its not gonna work for this but im gonna try again when you go  hey the good news is i think with your rtx 3080 you can probably emulate ps1 games im frustrated right now this run is too tight here i mean what i could do is i could just go full junk and do a big loop over here and just bring it back around you may recall that i claimed to be out of tubing before when i clearly have an entire additional spool the reason for that was that i didnt want to dip into my tubing supply for this system cause i know the defined 7xl is an extremely large case and i thought i might actually need all of it as it turns out we probably would have been fine but thats okay we got there  with the room i had in my budget i figured this was one of the best mics i could get for my use the rode pod mic its a dynamic mic its good at noise cancellation this can be a fairly noisy room especially now that theres all these consoles and pcs underneath and its a good starter microphone well see if i like streaming if you guys enjoy it and then maybe move up from there  david  david yeah  please tell me you have the extra modular cables for this power supply i need a molex connector  david ill bring over what i have  theyre not interchangeable what power supply is this  david thats for the n one  oh wait no definitely not yeah these use a completely different connector  david shoot  okay we dip in this molex connector and we jam the pins in this pc express power connector we dont need  david do it  okay so thats in there  david is this gonna work  wait wait wait wait wait hold on oh i have them backwards so other than that yes  david we have a smoke detector its cool i bet we have insurance too thats how im gonna buy a house burn this place down use the settlement money heck yeah  this conversation is making me extremely uncomfortable am i an accessory you have to promise me youll replace this after though  david i promise yeah ill get some electrical tape  no no thats not what i meant  david oh the cable  yes  david yeah ill do that too  what do you think andy  andy 99  99  andy yeah  yeah i dont think so right dont worry i got this  david yeah you do  im a hero usb for andrade goes here  if you guys watch the shortcircuits that i do which is generally nice this is the best mouse money can buy right now for gaming i poopooed powerplay but im willing to give it a shot this is my opportunity its opportunity to make sure theres no vomit on it sweater oh im already sad you cant plug in the dongle to this  its really heavy wheres this supposed to go  somewhere under here im gonna have to figure out the details i think im gonna have to put just a flat plank on the ground  okay it has a filtered underneath so i dont have it down there i gotta grab it  okay itll be fine for today with this computer its this and the 403  lets give it a quick reboot and see if it just fires right up into andrade how cool would that be  david that would be sick were doing it everybody  okay it doesnt yeah beep readability youve got to have that camel back there andrades booting  david amazing  okay so where does this go and where does that go  david oh theyre both gonna go in there  okay here we go good luck everybody  david tower login what is that  this doesnt have a network connection right now oh right long story trendnet is sending over their 2 12 gigs switch but its not here yet 2 12 gigabit is critical for davids setup not because he has super fast internet but because he needs a really really fast link between his nas and his gaming machine so that he can edit video off of it gigabits okay but 100 megabytes a second not that great these days for responsiveness 250 megabytes a second now were talking  david ethernets plugged in now  ethernet is plugged in now  david yeah  people are gonna relate to this setup so much cause this is like true gamer  david yeah  this isnt like poser or like rgb beep all over the place gamer  actually while youre doing that ill bring you the stuff thats quote unquote borrowed yeah so these are from the donation pile  oh yeah i couldnt possibly care less about them  and what about that r2d2  you know what your gain is my loss  thats my legal defense  we were supposed to build a computer in it and we just like never got around to it that was like an impulse buy when i was at the mall i was like oh we should build a computer in that fair enough  this rooms going crazy were running out of room but im gonna pull out this bin this is the bin that i unboxed on shortcircuit its filled with retro games i want to get my ps3 working again so i can play all those but i have my analog super nintendo so  linus do you have pilot wings  david i do not i used to have more friends steal a bunch and never return them  linus dicks  i know kelly you better fricking return my frigging super metroid or ill kill you  gotta give it a little philly fill here theres at least enough water in it this time that we should be able to leave it on long enough to see if we get a signal  david ah yeah  here we go all right im closing the gaming rig two water cooled systems david and does this rig just go right in next to this one  yeah sure today has been spoiled david day i am so lucky to get all this stuff ive gotten i know people all around the world are trying to get 3080s i got one but the one thing i cannot get is an ltt mouse pad  linus no stop it  i cant  i know theres more coming theres more coming  david okay ill see if i can snag one  well get you one when later when all the paying customers are done  so this is probably the least junk thing of my entire setup i took old wood from my desk so i used to have not just two pieces of pied project i had four pieces so i took one of those pieces i glued a desk pad to it put my keyboards wrist rest under there and it fits perfect on this armrest its a good enough thing and ill be able to play mouse and keyboard games on this tv with no issues at all oh my god  thats the virtual machine this is a good sign  thats windows  im gonna shut it down gracefully here im going to add the usb receiver for this as well as the audio capture and were gonna try and pass those through as well  sir  oh you need your hdmi capture card passed through as well  oh  okay theoretically this is gonna work oh yeah  david is it working  lets not get ahead of ourselves the ava media capture card is in the same ilm amu group as your ethernet controller  david what  really bad news all the pci express slots are bound to essential devices so we cant pass through the ava media part on its own but remember that crazy stupid idea that you had to use one of these what im hoping is that this top

N4wBrYyu8U8,new range rover sport full details,Sport,this is the allnew range rover sport its the third generation of range rover sport since 2005 and its shaping up to be one of the best suvs of 2022 it even comes with tech you cant get on the four fat range rover and in this video im going to tell you everything you need to know about this new car buy sell car wow the new range rover sport looks similar to the old car but there are plenty of important differences for starters the new grille is thinner and more square than before and the headlights have a new minimalist design thats much less fussy than on the old car the lower bumper looks much more modern than before and its new vents and creases look sportier than the big square opening you get on the full size range rover you can get some black trims or contrasting bronze ones depending on which model you choose these colors show up on the vents just behind the front wheels as well speaking of which the new range rover sport comes with a range of wheels including some fancy carbon fiber inlays and others that measure a whopping 23 inches across thats just as big as the rims on the larger range rover the new sport model has also borrowed flush door handles from that car and this new model gets rid of all the fussy creases and lines youve got down the side of the old sport the changes are even easier to spot at the back though the old car had some blocky square brake lights but the new sport comes with super thin lights that look more like they belong on a jaguar than a range rover the boot lid is very smooth too and the number plate is fitted to the rear bumper instead of underneath the rear windscreen youll spot some extra back trim underneath this with some shiny exhaust tips this is completely different from the range rover where the pipes are hidden behind the bump up but what do you think of this new cars design do you prefer the full size range rover or this sport let me know in the comments the new range rover sports interior is leaps and bounds ahead of the old cars cabin it looks completely modern mainly thanks to that massive slightly curved touchscreen and separate digital drivers display ill tell you more about these two in a bit the steering wheel is completely new and the dashboard takes a fair bit of inspiration from the larger range rover essentially this means there are loads of horizontal lines lots of contrasting trim and some neat hidden air vents the heating controls for these are mostly the same as on the range rover but the sport comes with its own center console with a more curved design and none of the vertical metal bars you get in the bigger car just like that range rover however you can get 22way electric adjustment with massage functions for the front seats passengers shouldnt feel left out in the back though they sit higher in the new range over sport than the old car and theres an extra three centimeters of leg room to give them space to stretch out landro has also given the new model a more practical boot pack it all the way to the roof and you can carry five adults plus 835 liters of their luggage thats 55 liters more than in the old range rover sport the new sport comes with loads of different engines to choose from theres a pair of three liter six cylinder diesels called the d300 and d350 these produce yes youve guessed it 300 or 350 horsepower theres also a p400 model with a three liter sixcylinder engine which yes it has 400 horsepower next up are the new p440 and p510e plugin hybrid models these also use a three liter six cylinder petrol engine mated to a 142 horsepower electric motor and they make either 440 horsepower or 510 horsepower respectively once again as the name suggests now the electric motor is powered by a 38 kilowatt hour battery theyll let you drive for up to 70 miles in electric only mode well thats what land rover claims the real world range will probably be a bit less than that its easiest with plugging hybrids not bothered about economy though well how about a twin turbo v8 model instead the new p530 gets a 44 litre twin turbo v8 with you guessed it again 530 horsepower now itll only return 24 miles per gallon but at least thats 17 better than the old range over sports v8 used to return and he really cares when it comes with launch control and does naught to 60 miles an hour in 43 seconds thats just as quick as the old range rover sport svr every new range rover sport comes with an 8speed automatic gearbox and 4wheel drive you also get high and low range modes and plenty of clever tech to make the new sport just as capable offroad as the proper fullfat range rover theres also a brand new offroad cruise control that land rover has never poured in one of its production cars before it constantly monitors the surface youre driving on and changes the cars speed and its suspension setup to make sure that you dont get stuck this works alongside the new wade driving mode to make sure you dont drive into deep water too quickly and end up having to make an awkward phone call to the breakdown services speaking of wading the new range over sport can drive through water thats 90 centimeters deep that is exactly the same depth as a land rover defender and fullsize range rover can manage however if youre really serious about offroading you might want to avoid on the plugin hybrid models because they lose out on seven millimeters of ground clearance and 18 millimeters of axle articulation compared to the normal petrol and diesel models the new range rover sport comes with the firms latest pivi pro infotainment system its pretty much the same as the one you get in the larger range rover so theres a 13inch central touch screen and a 14inch screen where you used to get analog dars in the old car you get wireless apple carplay and android auto and theres a wireless phone charging pad under the center console you can also use amazon alexa directly through the cars voice recognition software which means you can control smart gadgets at home while youre on your way back from work in the car theres also a new hayland rover personal assistant that lets you do things like make phone calls and control the heating without using any physical knobs or touchscreens not only that you can get the new car with an upgraded meridian sound system with 1430 watts of power and extra speakers in the headrests these work as part of the active noise cancelling system to reduce the volume of wind and tile noise as youre driving along land rover has confirmed that youll soon be able to buy a pure electric version of the new range rover sport this new car is set to arrive in 2024 about the same time as a new electric version of the latest large range rover if you want to see my detailed video on the new fullsize range rover click on the popout banner that should be appearing in the top right hand corner of the screen now or follow the link in the video description the new range over sport comes with an upgrade called the stormer handling pack the stormwater pack adds a rear electronically controlled limited slip differential to maximize traction when you accelerate out tight corners and it also comes with torque vectoring that can break the inside wheel to help the car make tight turns more quickly you get rear wheel steering as standard if you fork out for a 510 horsepower plugin hybrid or a 530 horsepower v8 petrol model how much will those cars cost you well ill tell you in a sec it might not come as standard like on the bigger range rover but the sport system works in exactly the same way it steers the back wheels by up to 73 degrees to reduce the turning circle from 125 meters to less than 11 meters the new range rover sport gets a similar active antiroll system as the larger range rover to stop it leaning too much in faster corners but theres one new feature in the sport that you cant even get in the bigger range rover its a new kind of adaptive air suspension unlike normal air suspension the new cars air springs can switch between different modes they use different volumes of air to help support the cars weight the greater the volume of air in the chamber the softer the suspension use less air to support the car and the ride will be firmer also known as sportier this tech has actually been used in other cars before like the porsche kn but this is the first time land rover has put it into one of its models the new range over sport comes with a boatload of safety kits you get automatic emergency braking front and rear parking sensors cruise control traffic sign recognition and lane keeping assist as standard theres also a 3d surround view camera system that shows you exactly how far you park from the curb and if that isnt enough to protect your massive 23inch alloy wheels theres also land rovers clear sight system this shows a live video feed from the front bumper directly onto the infotainment screen so you can see whats under the front wheels as youre driving along the new range river sport has gone on sale now but its quite a bit more expensive than before now you can pick up one of the older models from about 65 000 pounds but youll need at least 80 000 pounds to get your hands on an entrylevel new range over sport with a 300 horsepower diesel engine thats about 15 grand more than an entrylevel bmw x5 or mercedes gle and its about 20 000 pounds more than a basic audi q7 however if you fancy a top specification v8 model thatll set you back almost 115 000 pounds talk about inflation music i hope you all enjoyed the video if you did give it a like let me know some other videos youd like to see and click on those windows there to watch more videos and if you click on that box there you can get a car wow and we will help you silly car just upload some photos give a brief description now dealers will bid on your car to make sure you get a great price for it thanks for

beef got some spicy shredded potato pretty much an appetizer i always get whenever i see on the menu i love it so much but they actually do this really well here little sour very spicy very nummy poppy milky mushrooms tofu skin theres beef wood here this is really good looking for a cold day like lets this this 18hour broth thats pretty good really flavorful i should have got the uh extra spicy version but the flavor is rich theres a lot of sesame paste in here as well for a little bit of creaminess a little nummy not too much but overall flavor is pretty darn good also ordered this the broth soaks into the meat pretty well its really not much of a oh theres a dipping sauce actually make your own dipping sauce sesame hot oil some chili powder garlic im so happy or something like this anytime i go to any chinatown this is always something i love to get any sort of hot pot dry hot pot dumplings noodles just something i crave so much right doughs been soaking for a little bit you really dont need much of dipping sauce the broth is pretty good in this in this pot it was a good breakfast because theyre nice well ive been seeing like cultures like this everywhere so this is like beware of thieves poster and apparently what happens is i guess youre sitting down and someone comes by who looks like a chubbier version of al pacino and while theyre showing you the flyer they take your phone i will now be aware of anyone looking like a chubby or al pacino this looks really really good got a regular hojicha tea this is really cool a strawberry matcha spritz so this thing says straw matcha on top strawberry syrup i think on the bottom this is interesting let me know if you like it i mean its good i like matcha the matcha is not sweet the strawberry is do you like it it tastes like a salad it tastes like a salad i like the part where its like where you suck up mostly the strawberries so its a lot sweeter but then you get the part where its not sweet at all its a confusing drink im gonna just move on to to this this is the matcha this is the mochi cheese tea and its sweet matcha with mochi on top and the top foam is its not cheeseburger its mochi cheese this i like a lot its not overly sweet just a bit of sweetness foam is so delicious just dip some of that mochi in there cover it up with that nice foam take a sip thats just creamy its delicious slight bitterness from the matcha this is a perfect drink and perfect little accompanying bite next one for some dumplings oh wow this upstairs getting at t for about 10 minutes and now its just thunderstorming outside the dumpling place is about seven minute walk from here maybe well get a dry hot pot first the mama sangwoods its so massive also kind of like a samurai helmet like im literally eating dry hop on top of a samurai helmet giant dry hop height cilantro sesame greens tofu skin delicious fatty beef this is what ive been looking for some potatoes enoki mushrooms dry tofu skin soft delicious looking but sliced potatoes and so many chilies peppercorn in here wow oh also got some fatty intestines this when its thunderstorming outside this is the ultimate samurai helmet of spicy comfort food give me a lot of rice look at this my own complaint i wish it was spicier which was a little numbier they didnt really ask me what level of spiciness i want i dont know if they give you a choice at all to choose other than the spice level the flavor is fantastic milky mushroom is crunchy the fatty beef is tender the intestine fantastic but spice level i would say this is like low spice im barely feeling a tingle on my tongue like i said i think the overall flavor not counting spice is pretty good all the ingredients are extremely flavorful especially the potatoes very good i just actually cant make this any spicier now actually they just came by and theyre like yeah what you do for it so i said make it as spicy as possible so lets see what its like when it comes back its spicier i say maybe its now twice as spicy i like it they definitely heated this up with that chili powder first few bites i didnt feel like it was that spicy then it just kind of catches up to you and the heat starts turning on from the back of your tongue this is good i like this combination of food items too the sliced fatty beef is tender the potato is chewy i think they make the potatoes really nice a lot of these potatoes are a little charred on one side its perfect and the more you eat the heat just kind of compounds on your tongue so it definitely makes you suffer more and more in a good way as youre eating you can taste the fermented bean sauce even more now whatever im choosing between hot pots between dry hot pot and like a regular traditional hot pot its so hard to decide but luckily because the thunderstorm cant really get out of this area and this restaurant was right next to us got to have the best of both worlds im crying right now this is definitely an amazing amazingly delicious monster probably one of the best ive had anywhere and they definitely obliged by my request of making as spicy as possible oh still stormy i have the urge to just look up into the heavens and open my mouth and hold my tongue cool down chinatown its just bustling music at the bun house right now this place tons of dim sum tons of bao i think their salted egg bun look really really good from the pictures im gonna guess some of that its really interesting so on the top is just the buns and the different meats of the buns right on top here so i got pork beef lamb and a custard bun this is really cool look at this beautiful meat buns this one is lamb this is awesome the bun is perfect if your pillow was as soft as this you would just have a lifetime of amazing dreams the lamb inside is amazingly flavorful and besides that delightfully delicate meat theres also crunchy cartilage in here as well so you get some lean meat some fat some crunch from the cartilage the texture is amazing this is absolutely absolutely delicious and delightful this is the beef one shredded beef inside in scallions again bun is perfectly pillowy beef looks like its gonna melt as soon as it goes into my mouth it tastes like the tender beef from like a beef noodle soup with all that intense beefy flavor inside the sponge theres actually a lot of buns out there its just a typical minced meat with vegetables here youre tasting chunks of delicious beef definitely pork belly you get a ton of fat with each delightfully porky bite little sweet i cant taste if theres any heat because my tongues just not really working anymore after the spicy hopup yeah yeah but i see chilis i think my favorite one is still is the lamb thats so so nice the rest of these arent too shabby either this next one might be my favorite custard egg one oh wow that is so pretty a flood of yolky sweet deliciousness once the bun is broken one of the best salted egg ones ive ever had wow i think its just so creamy thats one of those bites thats going to remain on your mind for a long long time this is a very worthwhile place to check out if youre ever in chinatown london amazing for a meal or just a random snack oh my goodness there are ton of these american candy stores everywhere you go look at that oreos willy wonka sour patch like every other blog theres an american candy store music the food here looks amazing i got a lobster dumpling i dont think ive ever had lobster dumplings before and then a soup dumpling that requires a straw these are really really pretty so these are the lobster dumplings they kind of look like cabbage the way theyre folded green rim dip it in some hot oil vinegar and soy sauce so much juice inside though these are some extremely juicy dumplings definitely not the cheapest dumplings food in general in london super expensive but these are amazingly delicious its savory its fatty and all that combined with the sweetness of the lobster meat it makes this an incredible dumpling this thing just explodes whenever you take a bite this is a really good dumpling question ive been eating all day so thing good to water as many dumplings i wanted really wanted to try their pork one and they got all sorts of different flavors like mala pork and dill pork and mushroom like pork with pretty much any vegetable out there i mean it would be fantastic as well just look at that sweet glistening lobster meat i didnt want to get 12 pork dumplings but check out this cheyenne soup dumpling was not too giant but its at least double the size of a regular soup dumpling and it comes with a little straw music and slurp yeah my tongue is just getting punished today from a spicy mama jungle i definitely have not been kind to my tongue today from the spicy heat to this scolding hot broth oh this is really really hot be careful if youre ever slurping soup from a dumpling the dumpling will dump back from the little i can taste before my tongue cooked its really delicious porky broth so good i dont even really need a vinegar or hot oil thats really really delicious last thing i got this is a more of a dessert dumpling this is a pumpkin dumpling and it looks so cool the way they folded this and its made with sticky rice and im gonna just eat one of these while i wait for my tongue to kind of get some feeling back sticky rice on the outside red bean on the inside you get that nice flavor of the pumpkin sweet creamy red bean this is a perfect dish to use some hot tea so much soup left in here theres this giant piece of filling of just pork and scallions and a little bit of vinegar and some hot oil open up and let the soup flow out because its still burning hot in there i let it sit around for about 10 minutes already its still very hot this is so good their pork filling is excellent so much juice such a ginormous filling of course everything is handmade here feel like dumplings theres definitely a place worth trying last meal of the day it is this normal like its been raining raining all day sporadically for like 10 minutes therell be bright sunshine now and then itll rain again with the sunshine now then the sunshine will go away then the rain will stop and the sun will come out and then that whole cycle just repeats itself throughout the day i think its really confusing place to try to figure out if youre gonna bring umbrella out that day or not anyway at crystal china so theres actually a lot of great chinese restaurants around london um we left chinatown we found this local sichuan place seaweed salad they brought over little side dishes and main dish one is fatty thin sliced beef with smoky tiger chilies on the bottom this has been an amazing day of eating chinatown i thought in london was pretty darn awesome with a lot of food options i think the malasian was amazing the buns were superb and the dumplings that was some next level dumpling shop its not its definitely not the cheapest chinese food ive ever consumed but it is delicious so bad garlicky super spicy tons of beef on top the bottom is a soy sauce based sauce beef is thin its tender its delicious in the bottom oh my gosh its awesome theres a lot of different types of tiger chilies these are amazing these things they usually deseed them so theyre not super spicy but they are extremely smoky smoking a little sweet also got this fatty crunchy spicy and numbing intestine this has quickly become one of my favorite dishes like every citron restaurant i go to get some crispy intestines nothing just melts in your mouth take some large intestines eat it with the seaweed for a little additional crunch and just let that vinegary garlicky seaweed balance out that fatty fatty intestines yeah my tongue is still not yo so any spice im really really feeling it i havent been here for that long but so far the food gotta say exceeded my expectations also the whole chinatown area is so pretty really easy to get around and plus its smack in the middle of soho so its basically in the middle of london really fun to just grab something to eat and go walk around look at big ben check out westminster abbey and i didnt know this but chinatown really exploded after world war ii when the soldiers came back after falling in love with chinese food so where chinatown is now is not the original location of the first chinatown when the soldiers came back from fighting in the east and really developed a taste for chinese food and they wanted some more chinese people were always happy to feed anyway i never really truly explored londons chinatown before and gotta say i had a really funfilled day today and as always all the places i went to listed down below for you guys thank you all so much for watching until we eat again see you later

DduGAca6hZU,game theory the monster in the shadows poppy playtime chapter 2,Game,its been so long so good to see you again well not good really dont say anything mommy knows you thought you could just walk right in here didnt you as if nothing ever happened what a joke well theyre all dead all of them and you did that tried to live knowing that for whatever brief time but hey thats just a theory right a theory a theory a theory music hello internet welcome to game theory the show thats been popular for 11 years but still hasnt landed a movie deal dont know why i felt like mentioning it here on a completely unrelated note a few weeks ago we finally saw the release of poppy playtime chapter 2 flying a web and this thing was longer than a tech demo so hey big wins over part one but no the team wasnt content to stop there hoppy playtimes newest chapter went above and beyond requiring players to master not just one but two different gameplay styles whackamole and simon says yellow were duh violet every game is required to have a simon says segment for some reason im of course being facetious about the whole thing this new chapter actually offered a lot of awesome stuff cool puzzles thrilling chases and an oversized plush toy failing to pull a lever the animation is so adorable i could sit here and watch that all day oh and there are also collectible trophies now really challenging collectible trophies thatll push you to the limits of your gamer senses any secret trophies or anything that we see up here i need secret trophies secret trophies but we all know why were really here its not for the gameplay innovation or the collectibles its for the hidden notes and cryptic clues ladies and gentlemen we have ourselves some lore to decipher and spoiler alert poppy isnt who we thought she was first heres what you need to know to understand todays theory puppy playtime chapter 1 focused on us the player returning to an abandoned toy factory in order to save some employees that went missing there 10 years ago were told via mysterious note that we have to find the flower several puzzles and one giant muppet chase later we find the flower in the form of a giant wall mural of a poppy inside is a replica of a house and a doll named poppy playtime locked away inside of a glass case and of course we set her free without a second thought because players in video games have never seen a horror movie before anyway chapter 2 picks up immediately afterward poppy agrees to help us activate a train thatll help us get out of the factory so much for wanting to help save those missing employees but hey if a creepy talk and doll starts offering me ways to not be around the creepy talking doll im gonna take that offer but of course things are never quite that easy mommy longlegs a giant stretchy toy spider takes poppy hostage and forces us to play three minigames in her game station in order to unlock each part of the trains code eventually we break out of our games which causes her to go complete sicko mode and chase us through a narrow escape sequence where have i seen something like that before in the end she gets caught in a grinder and her remains are dragged away by a mysterious claw we rescue poppy get on the train but surprise surprise she betrays us crashing the train and forcing us even deeper into the factory so those are the highlights from the chapter but were still left with a lot of overarching questions who are we where are these missing employees were so concerned about whats the true nature of the toys and whos secretly pulling the strings behind all of this well i think i have the answers to each and every one of those questions and the last one is probably the best place to start as i just talked about after defeating mommy we see her remains get dragged away by a mysterious claw no not burn traps claw but also yeah kind of burn traps claw see the hand we see pool mommy way is very different from all the other designs that weve encountered in the game so far most of the toys that we fight are brightly colored made of plastic or fur and you know look like actual toys this thing though is dark mechanical and could poke your eye out its like an erector set on steroids and thats not all if you zoom in and enhance the image of the claw you can actually make out that theres organic material mixed in there bones and maybe even some veins mixed in with the metallic parts so yeah the comparison to spring trap burn trap call them whatever you want it isnt that much of a joke but what is this biomechanic hybrid doing within the context of poppy well back in chapter one we discovered the final vhs tape which catalogued the results of experiment one zero zero six nicknamed the prototype final log in relation experiment one 1006 the prototype coordination and cooperation is evidently within his skill set as well as the skill set of all other experiments of his type this along with a death screen that said experiment 1006 isnt he wonderful led us to believe in a previous theory that our big blue boy huggy wuggy was the prototype since you know he was kind of the only character that we met in chapter one occams razor and all that however take a look at the hand on the tv screen that we see during that vhs recording look familiar we see that hand appear again and yet another vhs tape in chapter two log code zero eight five zero two in relation experiment one zero zero six the prototype the prototype seems to possess an unprecedented level of intelligence beyond that of all other test subjects as well as an alarming willingness to commit violence experiment 1170 huggy wuggy remains the optimal outcome due to his sufficient intelligence paired with maximum obedience obviously this outright tells us that huggy isnt experiment 1006 and that its instead the owner of this mysterious claw so thats what the prototype is but what makes it so special well during that same vhs tape we also hear how the prototype takes apart an alarm clock and uses it to make a laser pointer in short its smart and its able to repurpose things which would explain mommys concern in this moment shes gonna be reused and repurposed by this entity in order to help the monster escape kind of makes you wonder if the veins and bones or how this creature was originally designed or maybe thats what happened to all the other missing employees their bodies were added to the machine its interesting in our last theory we predicted that mommy longlegs would be adding the bodies of dead toys to herself in order to become stronger we were right about the concept just looks like we were wrong about who it applied to as for how this thing is going to wind up looking anyone remember sid from toy story 1 sounds like we might have found one of his creations so right now it looks like the prototype 1006 is gonna be our overarching villain for the franchise taking pieces and parts of the other toys and maybe even pieces and parts of other people to grow stronger that being said one toy that doesnt appear to have been added to the prototype yet is huggy wuggy he may not have appeared explicitly in this chapter but hints of him are hidden around when you go into the chapters water treatment room if you look carefully you can see some blue fur thats scattered around the pipes alongside trails of blood this appears to be the room that huggy fell through at the end of the last chapter and would seem to imply that huggy picked himself up and went fullon sus mode by venting away waiting to return until a future chapter which honestly makes sense he cant die yet hes basically the mascot of the franchise who even cares about poppy at this point i mean me i do because lore but i feel like im definitely in the minority on that one speaking of poppy lets talk about her shall we i mean it is her name on the title screen after all this isnt kissy missy playtime or cat b playtime you know well mere hours after chapter 2 came out the fan community did what the fan community gonna do they dug into the game files and by doing so they discovered an early build of this chapter hidden away and while the game itself is still basically the same the end is where things get real interesting normally you get on the train and poppy gives you this sinister speech about how youre not allowed to leave she betrays us and sends us hurdling deeper into the factory for reasons that are kept pretty darn vague terrible things have happened but i know that whatever i need you to do you are capable however in the cut version of this monologue we actually get a bit more detail on her motivations you have so much potential i know you came to find the ones who had disappeared all those years ago but theyre gone theyve been gone for a long time terrible things have happened and i am the cause being able to exist as a doll it has killed so many people now interpreting cut content is always going to be a tricky science do you use it do you not how do you use it here im only pointing it out because this seems to confirm one of our original theories that poppy is the reason all of this is happening she literally says that because she was able to exist as a doll people died which tells us two things one that shes been around since the very beginning she knows about the experimentation thats being done on humans shes witnessed it all music yes yes we hear you youre very special you did it first secondly though it seems to tell us that poppy isnt who we originally thought loyal theorists will remember that last time we predicted that former employee stella graber was the person whose body and spirit were used to build poppy in chapter one we found a vhs tape talking about her desire to stay young and her love of children which all but seem to scream make me into an undying doll monster however after the clue seeded out in this chapter we know for a fact that she is no longer a candidate when we first enter the game station were greeted by stellas voice hi kids welcome to the game station im stella and weve got three super duper fun games to play her name also appears on the bottom of a document outlining how to test children using the various game station modules quote give all reports to ms stella graber to sort through so stella was clearly involved with whatever experimentation was going on at playtime co and since these experiments were started because the living doll poppy existed in the first place stella cant be poppy in that same document we also see references to mommy longlegs now if you look closely at the mommy longlegs commercial that plays at the top of the chapter you can see that its dated 1991 hoppy was meant to be the first living toy developed back in 1950 therefore if stella was alive around the time of mommy longlegs then she couldnt possibly be inside poppy so if poppy isnt stella then who is she well early in chapter 2 we visit elliott ludwigs office founder of playtime co its here that we learned that he experienced a tragic family loss sometime in the 1960s in the 1960s an unfortunate family death had pushed ludwig down to his lowest this loss is what spurred him to work harder and build an empire around his toys now its not actually clear who this family member was he would suspect his kid right kid dies or is dying and he finds a way to make her into a living toy yeah yeah i am broke and i will put you back together thank you fnaf go and do something else with your life make your lore more sensible stop trying to butt into other peoples narratives okay other peoples very similar narratives anyway as i was saying you would suspect that hes doing this for his kid right and thats who poppy is its his daughter but theres a wrinkle to that and its not coming from the game but rather the games website you see we know via newspaper article hidden on the about section of playtime companys merch website that eliots wife divorced him in 1930 this means that if a child came from that relationship that biological son or daughter would have been in their 20s or 30s when poppy was created it seems a bit old to be honest the loss could have been a grandchild thats definitely a possibility but for me i think the most likely option was that it was an adopted daughter in chapter one we see a lot of posters hanging on the walls talking about playtime cos adoption initiative what if that program was initially started because elliott had an adopted child himself and he wanted to bring that joy to other families thereby modeling it in those playtime company values and then when his daughter dies or is suffering he you know has to find a way to put her back together so his adopted child dies tragically and he tries something to revive her probably by fusing her with poppy and it works something he does works shes in the doll but hes not exactly sure what he did might i suggest trying remnant or agony sorry sorry now im just going out of my way to do it anyway we know that hes unsure based on a note that we find in elliots office in chapter 2 this note talks about experiment 814 in which they try to bring rats back to life using the poppy flower my suspicion is that this is because he was somehow able to revive his daughter inside of poppy a doll who were told has the essence of poppy flower built into her hair this is also why we find poppy hidden in the glass case its so his daughter can be preserved protected and also studied its because he saw it was possible and then he went on to repeat it which is why hes so happy about his wonderful experiment 1006 the prototype after nearly 200 additional experiments post poppy flowers and rats this is where he finally cracks the code hes brought things to life but the prototype is too smart it escapes and doesnt obey orders sending the factory into chaos this is why we hear that huggy wuggy is actually the perfect creation because hes smart but hes also obedient experiment one one seven zero huggy wuggy remains the optimal outcome due to his sufficient intelligence paired with maximum obedience and that my friends is the story of how everything started at playtime co we now know that elliot ludwigs adopted daughter is likely the entity inside the poppy doll and that our overarching villain for the series is the prototype the first successful recreation of that technology of bringing something back to life a toy that steals and uses the pieces and parts of other things to make itself stronger but theres still lots more to discover here who or what is inside the other toys are they employees or are they something else what about the mysterious death screens that we see each time we die what are they trying to tell us if people are inside of toys then what about the prototype is it someone important or is it just a random collection of people and probably the biggest question of all who are we in relation to all of this i suspect that i may have figured out our characters name and possible role in the company but answers to that and more well have to wait for next time just because i have a few other things that i want to double check inside the game first so make sure you grab pack that subscribe button to guarantee that you see our second part of chapter 2s coverage when it comes out here in a week or two and until then remember its all just a few a game theory thanks for watching

BFTKzlXFeAk,trump insider raided coup plotter has phone seized in bad news for magaworld,News,raids searches and  prosecutions welcome back sir   thank you  first after all i just want  to remind folks if you go back  a couple months you didnt have any of this you go back a couple weeks you  had signs developments  searches in the last two weeks you have  the physical lawful search of  mr clarks home and now a  physical interaction to get the  phone of mr eastman two people at the center of the coup plot  focuses around january 6th do you view this as a bad sign  for them and a sign the doj is  going up the chain or too early to tell  its bad news for both of  them the only way the government  could have obtained either of  those warrants is to have  probable cause one that there  was evidence of a crime in the case of eastman on his  phone and there was evidence of a  crime in clarks apartment now that probable cause cannot  be stale meaning it has to be  current and dont forget all of these  activities that occurred were  around january 6th almost over  six months ago so somehow the government has  come one current information on  both of these individuals that is somebody has either  ratted out john eastman or  somebody has somehow found out  that hes got information on  that telephone whether its  calls to various people recorded there whether its emails i mean hes got the iphone 12  which can actually contain  documents for all we know all  these documents that were  subpoenaed by the committee  some of which werent turned  over by the court so somebody somewhere has  basically put in the  governments possession the fact that there is information on  there currently and that there  was information in the apartment of jeffrey clark so that is what is so  breathtaking here  yeah and i want to jump in  just  i want to build i only have you for another  minute theres always violence of  january 6th thats been  prosecuted and whether there  are further limpings we dont  know but the public evidence against  these two people clark and  eastman is more about what they  did with trump going into the  6th meaning if there were no  violence that day would these  still be likely searches and  lawful warrants because what we do know is  theyre involved with alleged  crimes that didnt require  violence they required obstructing or  stealing an election   thats right its trying to basically come up with a letter saying  lying  that there was fraud in the  election to try to get the state of georgia to rescind and take  back its electoral votes from  joe biden so yes there are different  crimes here but again this  shows that the government is on  top of this because they got  somebody or people who are  telling them things that are  very current i was    lastly    i was always concerned    i got one  just want to get one more thing these arent traditional  prosecutors according to eastman it came  ouchlt inspector generals  office a sentence or two does  that matter  it could because that could  be the place where the evidence  came from somehow the inspector general  at least with eastman came  across the current evidence that made the probable cause for this warrant   very interesting to remind people inspector  general thats like the  watchdog so if you have people  who are lawyers or doj officials who are acting badly or like  criminals the ig is the first place to start whether it got worse than that  we dont know cant prejudge but

hSDhBXSdYig,fashion trends i love and dont love for 2022,Fashion,hi guys whats up its lindsay and welcome or welcome back to my channel today i thought it would be really fun to make a video talking about 2022 fashion trends which ones am i loving and what do i not see myself participating in because one of my goals for the year was to figure out my personal fashion style a little bit more and it can be hard to do that when there are just new trends and micro trends popping up constantly you know sustainability wise it is not a good idea to invest in every single trend and also personal style wise you know its good to pick and choose and ive been watching a lot of videos on 2022 trends so i thought i would link those below for you todays video is also sponsored by karma which is my

cash back to you and a good cause definitely check out karma and download the free chrome extension through the link in my description box now to get on to the trends that ive been liking first i picked out five for each that ive been liking and that i havent been liking and were just gonna go through them together clogs have been absolutely having their moment in 2022 and whether you like them or not its hard to avoid them i feel like i see them everywhere and i personally really like them i think you can do a boston birkenstock clog and look very casual very farmers market art teacher chic or you can do a more studded and embellished clog and look a little bit more like you put effort in but still theres just something so casual about a shoe that you just slide on into you dont have to do any lacing up you dont have to do any buttoning any zippers its just a slide its essentially a slipper and i think after the years that weve had people want comfort and so i think that is why slides in birkenstocks are so popular right now but weve been getting some really cute variations on them you know whether its a platform or again some embellishments they are something that i see myself investing in i just wanted to make sure that it was something that i would wear ill link a couple that i think are cute in the description box ive been really leaning towards the charlotte stone pair as well as intentionally blank next up you might have seen this coming if you watched my recent favorites video i have been loving denim skirts specifically long midi to maxi length denim skirts i think these can be styled in a really effortless like model offduty way i posted a tick tock wearing a denim skirt and someone told me that they never expected a denim skirt to look cool and not like one of the duggars so i do think its very important to get the right cut of denim midi or maxi skirt as you can see with the ones i put on screen most of them are fitted some of them have like a cool slit up it just for like some more movement i would avoid the ones that are kind of more like a tent um because you do still want to show off your silhouette these are really easy to thrift when i went thrifting like last weekend i saw a ton of denim skirts they used to be really popular in the 90s so because of that i think it is smarter to just thrift one than buy one new because the best part of these is when they are old and unique i feel like ive been seeing brown leather everywhere i dont know if its just me but i never used to pair brown and black together i didnt ever used to buy anything brown and with chocolate brown becoming really popular in the past year ive been seeing people wearing brown leather a lot especially with jackets bags shoes and like accessories brown leather to me feels just like the softer warmer version of black leather like black leather is a classic its never going out of style but sometimes i can feel kind of like im in the matrix or just kind of bored of always wearing black leather accessories because if you know me im always wearing black everywhere so that is definitely something i have my eye on at the moment and i really prefer to get second hand leather so i will be thrifting this and looking on the reel reel ive been seeing a lot of these loose knits on tick tock and instagram lately i think it has to do with how many people are getting into crocheting and knitting that theres like a huge resurgence of that right now so if you have the skills you could make one of these at home but it is definitely something i dont have the talent to do so i have had my eye on searching for something like this that i can layer with because i just think it adds a really interesting texture i feel like i could see this being more of like a spring trend or even summer if you do like a loose crochet over a bathing suit thats always been in style um it looks like its almost unraveling on your body which is cool for the last fashion trend that i love the look of this one im not too sure if i am capable of pulling it off you can let me know what you think um but that is cargo pants as well as cargo skirts basically just loose flowy pants maybe in like a thinner more workout material i dont think they necessarily have to have pockets on them or not ive been seeing a lot of these and again i really like the very effortless like im not trying very hard look and these definitely have that going for them im just not too sure a hundred percent if i can pull it off so ill probably try and thrift a pair thats really cheap and see how i feel in them but i like the way that they look and part of fashion is exploring things that might feel out of your comfort zone maybe youll look back and think its cringy in a year from now or maybe itll become a staple and you cant really know until you try it so i do tend to go the thrifted route for things like that just because um its cheaper as a sidebar this isnt one of the trends that i noted but ive been seeing a lot of kilts as well like people wearing long plaid skirts so i thrifted one for again like ten dollars i think it might have even been cheaper than that and ive yet to style it but im trying ill probably end up doing a 2022 thrifting trends video maybe in like the next month or so just to go off of this video and now on to a couple trends that i feel dont personally align with my aesthetic and that i dont see myself investing in or wearing but its totally fine if you like these things fashion is so individual and thats what makes it so cool um and i also think people can pull off all of these things i just dont think that i can or its not for me and thats okay futuristic jelly sneakers i do not understand the appeal of i do love dad sneakers like new balances and like you know traditionally ugly sneakers with an outfit but for some reason these jelly sneakers with all of the like strings and metallics and colors just i just cant get behind it thats all im saying i feel like ties got really big this last year and they can be very hit or miss for me i think sometimes with like the right going out outfit they can look really cool especially if its paired with like a shorter skirt and like i think this photo specifically shes pulling it off very very well both of these girls then a photo like this and this is bella hadid she looks like a waitress and her style is one of my absolute favorites it just doesnt always work for me and i love mens wear on women i feel like that is like one of my alltime favorite things in fashion but ties can be very give or take they have to be thin and i prefer them not super bold personally speaking of bold patterns i feel like bold pattern mixing is something that i just dont see lasting very long i think its already kind of dying out just because there was such a huge craze for the past few years i just i get really tired of seeing the same prince and i think that does have to do so much with fast fashion just running this trend to the ground i think the best example i can think of is this pattern from lisa s gaw i think the first time i saw it i thought it was cute but now it is everywhere everyones ripping it off and when i see it i get a headache and it sucks for the people that invested in it you know a 200 pair of pants in the beginning i would be careful what you do invest in when it comes to bolds just because bolds dont always hold up but again that is just my opinion i tend to invest in like quality basics and then get my more funky pieces from the thrift store where they are less expensive and a little bit more unique someone is very over me talking but the last trend or aesthetic that just does not personally work on me is y2k fashion rhinestones and heavy graphic embellishments with brand names i just dont see that really outlasting and every time ive kind of like dabbled in it i havent really liked the outfits after like six months let me see if i can find an example of me wearing like a somewhat y2k outfit it just isnt for me ive tried it i think its cute but i just dont feel confident when im wearing stuff like that but i totally respect the vibe curation that it is im just a very much a true 90s fashion kind of girl at heart always have been those are my personal hot takes when it comes to 2022 fashion trends definitely let me know what you guys have been into and not into in the comments and dont forget to download the completely free karma shopping assistant chrome extension the link will be in my description box thank you guys so much for watching and ill see you all very soon bye guys music music you
uNt_ReLwk40,i installed windows on steam deck and i regret it,Tech, windows on steam deck its here on thursday valve released the drivers that we needed to run the operating system that they have spent years trying to make sure we wont need linux users have literally begged us not to do this or at least not to recommend it but they forgot one simple fact i own this device its mine so whatever i do what i want and besides even i dont know if i would recommend this yet what i would recommend is our sponsor build redux build redux offers competitive pricing compared to building a pc yourself their website makes it easy to configure your build alongside their helpful support guides so head to buildreduxcomlinus and start creating your pc today we will talk about how we got to this point but i dont wanna keep you guys waiting and im gonna dive right in starting with desktop controls you can use either the right joystick or the right track pad to move the mouse cursor around and i gotta say right outta the gate having this track pad here compared to something like the joy x off on the in aya neo wow is that ever a lot better but theres one thing i immediately noticed missing push to tap how is that not a thing no instead and this is sort of intuitive you actually use the right trigger for a left click and the left trigger for right click pretty much every other handheld ive seen defaults the other way around left is left right is right but it seems like valve is of the mind that the dominant hand should be the one that is the most often clicked okay how do i scroll down the page out its probably left yeah there we go left analog stick okay we just brought up an onscreen keyboard by pushing down on the dpad im gonna close steam for now we can use the touch screen as well i guess thats worth mentioning oh wait no you need steam running in order to wait nope my mouse cursors back the right joystick doesnt work for it anymore though only the track pad does basically theres two control schemes theres the windows default which allows you to use this as a track pad and yeah is still right to left and left right or if you have steam launched itll actually treat the entire controller as a steam controller and you can use the joystick to control the mouse as well now that ive got steam launched again lets try to launch an application okay is it ive seen this on other handhelds as well for whatever reason uac prompts disable whatever software is allowing you to joystick to mouse on the steam deck though at least you can still use the okay i swear the touchpad worked a second to go now its not working to be clear a lot of these annoyances are kind of universal whenever youre trying to use windows on a handheld device its just very imperfect experience lets have a look at how this soc appears in cpuz since weve got it amd ryzen we dont know exactly what kind custom apu 0405 super cool nope does not know that this is lpddr5 all right then how about gpuz same thing has no idea what to make of this mess gpu clock zero megahertz custom apu 0405 fair enough gpu custom gpu 0405 picks up the memory speed at least doesnt seem to indicate in any way that this memory is shared between the gpu and cpu although it does note that 12 gigabytes of it is hardware reserved which would be whats reserved for our gpu wifi works bluetooth appears to be here actually i should fire up device manager clearly all the drivers are not working yet unknown devices multimedia controller multimedia controller would be the onboard audio so the 35 millimeter jack and the speakers do not work so you can use bluetooth or you can use a typec to headphone adapter for now i think we should launch a game and of course we have a second steam deck i can already tell that this is running like absolute dog poo on windows compared to linux its not even close its not even just that the fps is lower its just a difference in responsiveness and like stutterinesss super unresponsive  anthony funny while i was testing this with the haptics going i thought that the speaker was going for some reason  yeah  anthony because the haptics are so weak  the haptics are well theres no haptics its just the vibration in the touch pads  anthony yeah  so theyve tuned that in linux so it doesnt feel so like kind of cheap and ugly sounding but in windows clearly that same tuning hasnt taken place well how about on windows what does the steam button and the overlay button do big fat load and nothing  anthony i mean the steam button should pull up the steam overlay or something but  oh oh it does it does it pulls up the steam overlay which does allow me to exit the game so its just the quick access menu button that doesnt do anything okay thats good obviously its a less comprehensive steam overlay lets try something else i have not played elden ring yet so far launch time looks pretty similar i started the windows once lately before thats a solid linux win right there  anthony that doesnt look right on the windows side  linus no it really doesnt  anthony when i testing it earlier the loading screens are only 16 by nine so the actual background like the game assets loading in could be seen in the seams at the top and bottom of the screen  oh hilarious lets try borderless windowed ive had better luck with gog and some kit what hello weird oh  anthony oh hey  hey were back time to not mess with that again im loading up a new game here because we did all the benchmarking on this steam account where were actually a little bit into the game but i wanted to be able to play them side by side with you guys so we got a new account for the linux machine and we wanted to be able to just switch back and forth between them okay wow big picture has work to do i mean valve has said that theyre going to adapt big picture based on the steamos steam deck interface like this oh man night and day so much better  anthony there it is you can see the seams  linus oh thats weird  anthony this is a famously bad port  linux for the win for loading times again  anthony wow his windows really that far behind  oh shoot i didnt open frame view this is another thing that im not expecting to be a great experience on the steam deck other handhelds have a button to minimize the game and jump to the desktop i suspect valve has integrated no such functionality i mean i dont need framed you to tell me thats terrible ive read about hitches and stutters in this game but this is unbelievable valve apparently used the fact that they are translating directx to vulcan to implement a preshader compilation routine that prevents it from starting the crazy thing about windows though is that this isnt even behaving like on the fly shader compiling like it should stop doing it  anthony it should  linus after i do a full rotation  anthony but it doesnt  and so the fact that were running this translation layer actually results in better smoothness i think its time for us to stop the side by side comparison and get into the empirical data then we ran benchmarks on three great on deck games and linux users can breathe the side of relief because steamos handily outperformed windows particularly in hitman 3 where steamos gives playable if inconsistent frame rates while windows average is a painful 19 fps doom eternal hit a 60 fpss average on steamos while windows was stuck in the high 40s and elden ring famously far more playable on deck than on windows pulls ahead in terms of frame rate and as you guys saw didnt suffer from the same stuttering that the pc port has treated windows gamers too our swacket dont suffer either by the way lttstorecom but what about controls outside of steam we already saw that launching steam takes over the decks controller can we do the same in say an emulator what did you put on here  anthony i just put on retroarch oh crap i dont have screen cap it did this in testing too for whatever reason retroarch what youre seeing on your screen is not what im seeing on this screen this screen shows the desktop  oh beautiful oh my god come on retroarch i just i mean this could be a steam controller issue how do i go back if my controllers not allowing me to go back wait oh and this is off now wait what back instead of going back  anthony yup  negatively toggles a setting and then confirm activates the setting that is the strangest behavior i think ive ever seen out of a controller ever  anthony is steam still running  yes  anthony that might be the problem  i dont even know if im gonna be able to close this software theres no task manager button or control alt delete button like you would see on a windows optimized handheld that thats the kind of thing that you could probably bind i mean the steam controller is infinitely customizable its one of the best things about it but anthony i dont think i could close retro arch because i cant go back this is crazy x and y will sometimes go down or up and down multiple items in the menu and sometimes just one see here it does just one what is happening  anthony oh you activated the onscreen keyboard  linus i did  anthony yes you cant see it but i can unless theres an escape key on that no i dont think that  press again to quit yes  anthony full disclosure i expected that to happen  oh thanks anthony well this is just as bad back doesnt go back how do i go back b is trying to close retroarch  anthony the default control scheme in windows without steam running for the steam deck is that that key is escape  linus so is that a valve issue or is that a windows issue  anthony that would be a valves controller mapping issue now normally that makes sense for navigating windows because the up and down arrows are just like the  linus yeah  anthony the dpad is the up and down arrows left and right  but i guess  anthony so you can navigate everything with the buttons pretty well  that probably why we have an xbox controller here  anthony right  because now b is back because its picked up as a controller not as a windows pointer device  anthony yeah so i think retroarch is gonna have to add a controller definition file or something to hook into it like they do with the steam deck and with the xbox 360 controller and xbox one  right well will the game work  anthony the game should work  okay lets try the game then at least mumbles what it doesnt work even in game its still in oh man all right well i still want to know about the latency i mean i guess itll be fine its just windows  anthony i mean it should be  oh yeah i mean this feels great  anthony mostly i just wanted to show off the fact that the controls are  hot garbage and broken  anthony yes  got it  anthony so better use steam  yeah pretty much oh no not charging chuck where oh i wanna get up there ah balls and there are a lot of other things to keep in mind if you wanna run windows on deck for one youre not able to dual boot steamos and windows until valve releases the final steamos installer with support for this baked in i already mentioned there isnt an audio driver for the speakers or the 35 millimeter headphone check yet but audio via usbc or bluetooth does work apparently a driver will be coming for that sooner rather than later well we dont have an eta for is things like the brightness slider fix okay it works fine sometimes and sometimes it doesnt respond to the full drag  anthony yeah so you need to drag it back and forth towards the end that you want to go to so if you wanna get it brighter you need to go to max and drag it back and forth you wanna go darker you need to drag back and forth  linus i think if goes slow its fine so it might be an acceleration issue with the touch to mouse input detection or whatever i dont know the proper technical terms for it but it seems to be that if you go fast it doesnt make it the whole way which could be a touchscreen responsiveness issue in windows im sure its fixable but we dont know when or if that will ever be fixed and theres also the much larger problem where the deck doesnt like to come out of sleep in windows either it takes forever or never wakes up so youll wanna disable sleep unless youre into hard powering off in order to get back into windows but thats not a great experience for a handheld device whats more when you go to actually install windows youre gonna notice that the display is rotated 90 degrees thats actually pretty common for devices like this because they often use panels that were designed originally for tablets it just means that until you get to the windows desktop youre gonna have to deal with that you wont have any wifi so youll have to install without a product key if you dont have a typec ethernet dongle and speaking of youre probably gonna want a typec to usba adapter or ideally a multiport dongle like this one so that you can plug in a usb flash drive and a keyboard and mouse it can be done without but its definitely not as seamless all of which raises the big question here why would anyone want to run windows on the steam deck well i can think of a few reasons even ignoring familiarity with the interface and the apps access to xbox services comes to mind while alternative launchers and storefronts for epic game store and gog are available on linux xbox still isnt and that means there are some games that you simply cannot play on steamos right now even ignoring anticheat problems and youre certainly not gonna get access to game pass unless youre streaming from a windows device or from microsoft zone servers ive also personally run into some very frustrating bugs while gaming on the deck i just completed a run through of horizon zero dawn start to finish on my personal deck and i saw everything from drops down to one fps for extended periods like im talking 10 30 seconds at a time to hard game crashes back to the steam interface to even black screens that necessitated a full system shut down this raise is serious questions for me about the thoroughness of valves game verification program horizon zero dawn is a great on deck game but my experience was anything but great and i sincerely doubt that if sony had actually been involved in this certification process they wouldve signed off on it being advertised as great on deck in fact theres a great blog post on gaming on linux from the lead developer of faudio which is a core component of proton the compatibility layer that allows windows games to run on linux criticizing valves collaboration or lack thereof with third party developers so if valve is just yoloing it whats the process there are only so many hours in a day and valve seems to be validating a lot of freaking games based on my experience with horizon zero dawn what i suspect theyre doing is theyre just firing up the game playing early areas which in many games tend not to be as demanding and going yep seems good rubber stamp and i actually didnt have any issues in the first five hours of my play through for horizon zero dawn but by the end i was getting crashing or stuttering about every 30 minutes or so not a great experience other than that though steamos is objectively the much more polished experience the quick access menu with its convenient diagnostics and controls is conspicuously absent from windows and even basic functionality like charging still seems to have issues in windows we actually observed our steam deck discharging while plugged in which is something that i have never seen running steamos so valve is allowing users to run windows even facilitating it by providing drivers and public help docs good guy valve a hundred percent and were gonna have those linked down below if you wanna do it yourself but the roughness of the experience does make me wonder are they ever going to put in the effort that it would take to make it as smooth as steamos my gut feeling is no which makes me wonder how much of the performance difference we saw is down to a lack of a optimization i mean theoretically the same hardware should perform very similarly across windows and linux and this our results were not even close now admittedly that could be as much amds fault as valves and the steam deck also features a very unusual architecture for a windows machine with the cpu and gpu course sharing common memory im sure steamos on the other hand was carefully tuned to account for this i just feel like there was a lot of windows performance left on the table here and our investigation today has left us with more questions than answers the one answer we have right now though is that we wouldnt recommend windows on the steam deck at least not in its current state so if your must have games dont work on steamos you might just have to pony up for a competing handheld that is at least until valve makes dual booting possible which is something were planning to explore along with a two terabyte internal storage upgrade to the deck so make sure you are subscribed for that and make sure youre subscribed to hear about our sponsor dbrand the robots at dbrand drove a truck of money to our office to push their new project kill switch on pretty much every steam deck video that we have whats project kill switch well its a project to kill the switch i think basically its similar to their grip cases for phones and other devices but for your steam deck its got a rugged rubberized finish plus a kickstand for when youre gaming on the go but you wanna pull out a controller theyve also got their tempered glass screen protector for the steam deck which we tested out for them turns out regular tempered glass inhibits touch sensitivity but dbrands screen protectors are super precise and guaranteed to work on your display so why wait you can reserve projects killswitch now at dbrandcomkillswitch or at the link down below thanks for watching guys go check out our initial review of the steam deck for more decky goodness it still blows my mind that they managed to ship these things especially for this price
2ywCAiu9hI0,miss xo is doing too much  she came for shoprite workers saying she would,Entertainment,music oh music oh hi ninjas how are you guys doing its oklahoma aka sphere for color prime back for oil entertainment if the first time joining me almost david welcome please do make sure that i subscribe and obviously hit the bell i absolutely love you and dont forget follow me on instagram tech talking twitter is that boldly oh i mean now many just before we get into this video today i want to go ahead and actually say guys im sure that theres actually sort of like a banner here or yeah you know that actually has um phone numbers and you know everything so ive seen that im getting a lot of questions about oh i mean i want to do a shout out what should i do so basically this is what you do you simply pay you make a payment of 380 after making the payment you send proof of payment to the whatsapp numbers of the numbers that are here and um after that you send a 30 second clip a video of you advertising your channel you can literally go as well as you want as long as theres no background music and then im gonna go ahead and place that video in my video and that is it so theres really nothing much you guys because im saying that im getting a lot of questions emails dms whatsapp um its simply that all you need is that there is a con video clip you also just need to pay 380 and send proof of payment and were done okay ill take it from there anyway just go ahead and get into this chande darling okay miss xo has been trending she was trending and she was trending for her high valued woman um video now im not even going to lie you guys ive never watched the video im just not the target market for miss xos channel um and theres absolutely nothing wrong with that um she does have her own target market and its quite a lot of people she does have over a hundred thousand subscribers so congratulations girl i know you really wanted to read that number so the other thing again that i actually saw was that you know of course there was a debate that came in of um people that were basically just asking like you know what is a high valued woman i even saw tado um fox um actually talk about this so if at the end i do choose to include a video i will but if i dont just go to my instagram account and you will get that video um and you know its just a lot of stuff that are being said then everything now obviously being someone that does not watch me miss xos channel i do come across some of her clips like either on tik tok or on twitter people reposting and all that and i do have to say i actually love the confidence that the girl has okay i love the confidence that she has um however as i said you know her thoughts and um what she stands for her values is not what i agree with or on so as people i think that were gonna just agree to disagree with them okay like we dont need to have any bad feelings okay so people are basically you guys like talking about that video and i did see some clips there was also another clip that i saw of girl basically saying that she shes winning because she wakes up every day and her account shes got um six figure accounts like her balance book okay and i was literally sitting down and i was like wait six figures like if you have a hundred thousand you can actually say ive got six figures in my account only a hundred thousand you can actually say that so i was like okay it is good though because also i should not say only because a hundred thousand is not just only or also a lot of money but um we dont know how much she has we know shes saying that she wakes up with a six figure so shes not in the seven figure set okay so basically ninjas that when she was being trended for that i was like i bet twitter just has not seen this clip of miss eggs so lets go ahead and roll this one people ill rather date someone who works at shop ride or check yourself i would scream and die i would date that person because i didnt like how are you going to like live and stuff people id rather date someone who works at shop ride or check it out i would scream and die i i would date that person i didnt die because like i respect but like they like how are you gonna like live and stuff ciao i had to play it for you guys twice because i spilled water im someone that is not a secret you guys i am 31 and um i have lived i have learned i have seen whichever life um um you know advice i want to give i do give and i give from my experience and i do always tell you guys a broke guy is a nono thats me thats my own you can take this advice or not but for me is the burrow key hes not as the one okay like they just prove time and time again to just not be good humans in my opinion you know but i also dont believe in shaming people i also dont believe in looking down on people like i just felt like the statement that a girl said and the way she said it was so wrong i dont wanna lie like thats me you know like how can she say like id literally scream and die like how would you live and stuff why would you scream and die hi girl mother youre doing too much why would you scream and die its not even a funny video but i just really found it so crazy that people are so out of touch with reality people are so out of touch with reality its quite hard out there hey its honestly quite hard out there because i know the hands now that you know they can just give you 300 000 raise like oh heres 300 000 like no but theres certain people that need to literally hustle and work or shop right and pick and do this and do that and that is fine thats also a job not someone that you personally date however i dont feel like its also right that you would literally need to talk about other people like with so much it seems like there was like a bit of an element of disgust in there in my personal opinion i was like like why would you say that why would you even say it like that i need to wrote this part again i would scream and die i would date that person because i didnt die because like i respect but like they like how are you gonna like live and stuff guyzzini can we have the ones that we want to go for but not necessarily having to doubt the ones we dont want because when someone is like id literally scream and die like what do you mean how would you live in stuff like they are living there people that are living clearly that people that are working with shoprite and they are living we see them there and work alive every day i think that its also just very important that we do also understand that as much as not personally i wont lie i wont date a broke guy thats me thats me but im not gonna be out here now like trying to make it seem like you know i need to down bro guys i need no i dont think thats the way i dont think you need to talk with that element of like almost i even saw people that were coming because i got that clip on tick tock that was like why is she talking as if shes disgusted you know shes obviously not the target market of broke guys but i dont think that she needed to say it they like that you know so i was just laughing what i bet twitter just have not come across that clip because that would have definitely trended alongside the high valued uh nonsense okay um so basically yeah guys anyway i want you guys to go ahead and comment down below what you guys think of this whole situation um and so yeah well comment down below i love you guys stay blessed and i will see you guys my next upload

said but i will do that tonight ive been craving marshmallows okay so im just sitting here i didnt film it im just talking to amber im in the middle of talking to amber and a girl comes by and she hands me this note this is ashley im a big fan you seem busy but i want to say hi and then on the bottom it says keep doing you your laughter is contagious thats literally been nice to see in the whole world i dont know if she just left but i want to go find her because that was like so freaking nice foreign music patch kid that i just stole off the table okay so ive been sitting here doing work for like an hour i think and i just checked my laptop and mr kelly wakasa is at one million subs wow so i have to give this man a call hyatt knew he was gonna hit a million subs today this is not catching me off guard i literally have already ordered a cake to the house and im gonna go pick up one million blues from a party city probably right now im gonna go get them and im gonna bring them home and surprise him with it but i you know i gotta give him a call to say congrats because like this is such a major milestone for youtubers and im so proud of him so i gotta im gonna give him a call right now gosh okay he didnt answer because i am pretty sure hes probably on the phone with his family but i think its time to go pick up his balloons so time to close on my computer and lets go music foreign music im so excited for him like what a big amazing moment oh my goodness im gonna cry okay time to get the balloons the balloons so many balloons is actually my second time carrying around one million balloons around the city because elliot also hit a million and i got him like pretty similar balloons from party city everybody loves a little cheesy one million balloon set so i get to tote these around i get to drag them into the uber i feel like every day im either carrying around like balloons or a camera and just gosh i feel like im always making a scene but life is more fun that way i suppose foreign so hard to carry these also the uber driver asked me if i had a child i think he thought the 1m meant one month and he was like wow congrats its your childs birthday and i was like uh i actually dont have a child and i just said it was my roommates birthday my roommate is turning one month old i guess kelly laughter yes i did congrats im so proud of you im so happy thank you oh my god this is so funny i really tied it on there because i didnt want it were you literally walking around yeah with these no i was in an uber it looks like were having a baby well actually the uber told me congrats its your childs birthday congrats they thought it meant one month i think wow im a real youtuber oh yeah one meal one mil im so proud kelly welcome to the one million club sir its been a pleasure how do you feel the same look at that knox youre a boss man thats the hardest thing ive ever done and like literally all right were both hungry so we are going to go grab pokeballs its just tom and zendaya going out for a spin whos tom whos zendaya im thomas is your first meal since hitting a million honestly theres probably a million pieces of rice in there oh music yes yours looks really good basically just like a bowl with tofu and zucchini noodles tomatoes oh i forgot that was for mango man corn oh the mangos so good salad i dont even know but its good its a good nice day today all right you know what we have to say do it excite no no no do you know what we have to say be stand beasted music thank you music okay now i am back home so full for my yummy dinner um and i decided that since its productive day there are a few things that i want to do that have actually been haunting me for months and one of those things is called my credit card company because i lock my debit card because i was like trying to buy something in france and i didnt call them first so i hope that by watching me do this task that i have put off for days upon days i hope it inspires you to do a task that you have also been putting off for a long time if youre calling hi um i think my credit card got locked on a transaction bye all right bye got my credit card back lets go wait off my shoulders guys now im just working on a little more stuff whats this oh oh pretend some merch design ive been trying to work on merch guys i dont think itll be available until the fall but like im working on it and were getting there so super excited for that i think actually for now something that ive been meaning to do forever is put a watermark on my youtube channel like so right here if you like hover on the screen basically like itll pop up itll say your mom ashley like a little bubble and if you tap on it you can subscribe which you should probably do lets get to it took me like a minute your mom ashley and thatll be my little watermark hover your mouse and tap it now kelly has left the house so i am gonna do a little bit more of a surprise for him basically i

UzmvtVAuuyI,montessori school education,Education,montessori education is based on the principles developed by maria montessori who opened her first school for children of lowincome workers in an apartment building in rome in 1907 the school was called  “casa dei bambini” home for children this first “casa” was furnished with a teachers table a stove a blackboard some chairs group tables for the children and a cabinet filled with materials that montessori developed in her earlier career when she researched how to teach kids who experience some form of mental disability maria montessori created the materials  after she realised that students seem to understand complex concepts better when they engaged all their senses activities at this first school included personal care such as dressing and undressing care of the environment like sweeping dusting and gardening otherwise they were free to move around  and play with the materials montessori did not teach herself but instead oversaw the classroom work of her teachers montessori observed that children showed episodes of deep concentration and multiple repetitions of the same activity given free choice kids showed more interest in practical activities  and the materials than normal toys sweets or other rewards over time spontaneous selfdiscipline emerged montessori concluded that working independently children seemed to reach new levels of autonomy and become selfmotivated learners she began to see the role of the teacher as a facilitator of young human beings who are free to move and act within the limits of a prepared environment the goal to grow children to become independent and responsible adults who share a love for learning soon after montessori herself and her ideas started travelling the world to inspired progressive thinkers and educators from all over the inventors alexander graham bell and thomas edison became early advocates later alumni include jimmy wales from wikipedia author gabriel garcia marquez as well as the two google founders larry page and sergey brin today the term “montessori” stands more for a method than a school itself the fact that it can be used freely by anyone led to a great variation of schools educators all over the world borrow montessoris name insights and materials to organize kindergartens elementary schools special needs programs or even full 12 year curriculums some parents use it for homeschooling the following characteristics are shared  among most programs  students are free to choose what to learn  open classrooms that allow free movement  use of specialised montessori materials  mixed age classes from 03 36 or 612 so children can learn from each other  uninterrupted blocks of study time usually three hours  no grading or homework  and a trained teacher maria montessori once famously said “never help a child with a task  at which he feels he can succeed” what are your thoughts on montessori please share your opinions in the comments below
gkfLzA4QUQM,cool tech gadgets 2022  sony xm5 headphones portable projector desk setup upgrades,Tech,whats going on everyone its justin here and today ive got a new cool tech episode where were taking a look at a whole variety of products as you guys have seen in previous versions of this series and as always if you like to win something just make sure you go ahead and drop a like on this video subscribe to the channel and also leave a comment down below with what your favorite item is and ill be picking a winner in the comment section and messaging you on instagram in a few weeks so in todays video i feel like its kind of the summer theme you have a lot of products that can appeal to people who travel are looking to improve their desk setups or also just planning to go outside because we have this projector from nomadic which is in a nice four screen color it is very portable and easy to use as well as sonys brand new headphones which are the new xm5s and if youre doing a ton of traveling these are musthaves and theres also the logitech mx mechanical keyboard that i checked out recently and that is something that can really make a difference to your daily productivity workflow so without further ado lets go ahead and get started and as always all the products are going to be linked down below so with a ton of travel coming up this product could have come out at a better time and that is the brand new sony wh1000 xm5s the name is something that they still havent updated but this headphone is a refresh to sonys flagship active noise cancellation headphones and its essentially their best combination of active noise cancellation as well as sound quality the first thing that youre gonna notice is that the design is slightly refined you can see it just has like a very simple and minimal look and that is an approach that bose has also gone with as well i think sonys design has always been quite good i liked it in both like the white and the black version but i feel like the white version is able to hide fingerprints a lot better it still has a very durable fit to it but it does have quite a bit of plastic considering it comes in at the price of about four hundred dollars the multinoise sensor technology features eight microphones and its able to capture that ambient sound and accurately reduce the high frequency noise thanks to the auto nc optimizer something that sony has focused a lot on is in their processing and this has the hd noise cancelling processor qn1 as well as the integrated processor v1 in terms of noise cancellation ive had some great experiences on the market but this is probably the best available at the moment and when it comes to the actual sound quality it features a new 30 millimeter driver which has a nice like tight sound to it but at the same time is very well balanced and still delivers quite a bit of bass the form factor itself definitely reflects quite a bit of power when it comes to its setup and the total battery life that it is able to deliver is about 30 hours so when youre looking for a headphone that is able to block out all the ambient noise on a plane for example then this is an option that could be a goto product if you travel a ton but this option right here is probably the best noise cancellation with very good sound quality whereas the bose 700 is maybe a little bit more portable and still has pretty good sound quality and even though i really like the sound that the airpod max is able to produce it is just way too big and i dont really find the comfort to be that good so i think this is a very compelling option right here music so the next set of products are ones that you can definitely add to your desk setup and it is from logitech they actually had a few releases in the past month some of which were more minor updates whereas others are a bit of a different form factor and maybe something that youre not quite used to from logitech but the first one is the mx mechanical keyboard if you guys want to go ahead and check out the full review and detailed comparison on my channel ill have a link to that down below but this is a mechanical version of the logitech mx keys which is more of a productivity keyboard which you normally wouldnt attribute with a mechanical option but i do feel like in the past couple years mechanical keyboards have become increasingly popular in use of productivity or just daytoday typing as opposed to what was normally more so for gaming before theres been a lot of good options on the market theres like keychron for example and like the habit which is a very nice budget price and the logitech keyboards tend to come in at a price point between 100 and 150 dollars and this is the mechanical keyboard that is available in both the mini version right here as well as in a version that has the number pad whats cool about it is that it is a mechanical keyboard that has three different switch options so this is the brown switch the more like soft and tactile one that still has a bit of audible feedback theres also one that is in the middle and theres another that is a lot more clicky and you can pick between the brown the red and the blue choice and personally i think the blue one is the one that is best suited for me but ive also really liked the brown one right here one of the biggest observations that i have is that when it comes to key travel it is right in the middle it doesnt have like too much travel like a fullsize gaming keyboard but at the same time it isnt a laptop keyboard i think its a perfect amount if you do a ton of typing on a daytoday basis and this is why i think this is going to be very popular they also launched the mx3s mouse which is a lot quieter and it has a higher dpi rating but that is more of a minor incremental update but another product that has increasing popularity lately is the vertical ergonomics this is a logitech lift and it comes in at a price point that is quite a bit under a hundred dollars which i think is very reasonable and it is available in quite a few fun colors as well i personally have to use the mx master mouse because of the horizontal scrolling for video editing but this vertical form factor is good for ergonomics when it comes to just giving your wrist a bit of a break a lot of times having your hand in this position for many hours a day is a bit awkward and so if you want to get past that then i think this logitech lift is the perfect solution it does have like a nice scroll wheel theres also a bit of a control right here and buttons on the side but as i mentioned if you need the horizontal scrolling then the mx master is your only option from a design standpoint it looks great it has a soft touch finish for the palm and it has the same ridges that you find on their flagship mouse so yeah if you guys want to check this out these are some new products from logitech that came out recently music so one of my favorite items to check out on the channel is projectors and we have covered a ton of them theres ones that have like very large image throws as well as like laser tvs that are more short throw but at the same time i feel like this is a category that has seen a ton of improvement especially in the past couple years this right here is a nomadic x300 and i want to give a huge thanks to them for sponsoring this video and if you want to go ahead and check it out for yourself im going to drop a link down below but theres a few elements of it that i really enjoy including the design the sound quality the overall form factor as well as just the ease of portability to be able to bring this with you everywhere whether youre going camping staying at a cabin for a week you can literally just put this in the car take it with you and enjoy movies at a large scale like a hundred inches so from a design standpoint this has got to be one of the best looking projectors that ive checked out to date it has like this nice finish that goes all the way around in this forest olive green color which is very popular youve seen apple do it recently as well as like a gold trim that goes throughout with the metal finish and a grill on the front the general form factor is laid out in the fact that you have a mirror on the top that is able to reflect that image up to 100 inches at a full hd resolution but beyond that you have all of your controls along the top here and just some of the specifics of connecting the audio as well because you can use this as a speaker what is nice if you want to take this anywhere with you there is like a leather strap that you can just like carry it around like a lunchbox or a bluetooth speaker and theres also a partnership with harman kardon here where theyve built like a custom speaker setup that is not only able to give you great music listening experience but also enjoying it through movies and tv shows that you want to watch with the projector going into the specs of the display its it will give you a 1080p full hd resolution with a superb color range and a 3 million to 1 contrast ratio it totals its just about a billion colors and it has a 125 rec 709 coverage which for like a projector of the size it may not have features like hdr or p3 color gamut but i feel like the form factor is where this really shines and in dark scenarios it is able to perform quite nicely you just play a movie on it and you can see that in a hundred inch form factor it is able to give you like a pretty good level of contrast which i think is one of the most important things when it comes to portable projectors but the sharpness was decent and the color accuracy was relatively good it is also a completely wireless setup because you can just stream via wifi and bluetooth on top of that it also has a builtin ten thousand milliamp hour battery which gives you three hours of projection when youre watching movies and six hours of music listening which i would say is pretty respectable but whenever you can you do want to just keep it plugged in but another thing that i also notice is just how quiet the projector is when it comes to some of the details of the audio technology and partnership with harman kardon it features dual sets of tweeters and woofers as well as passive radiators and its powered by a 30 watt class d amplifier harman kardon is obviously a very well known brand and with that audio optimization i found that due to its size and everything it was able to deliver as like a bluetooth speaker giving you a good level of bass relatively clear troubles and when it comes to the home theater experience and the fans that are inside a good speaker is an added bonus whenever you have a portable setup like this where you just want to bring this and nothing else its almost like they prioritize the audio side just as much as i did the video when it comes to like the i o side of things you do have your power control the micro sd card slot an auxiliary cord as well as an auxiliary out a usb for charging your smartphone or something theres also an ir blaster um hdmi usb type c and also the dc so theres just a ton of flexibility there you can connect your own devices such as a game console and have that on the go but i just like the fact that its all laid out very nicely theres like an open front and back for great 360 degree dimensional speaker sound and also a lot of room for it to ventilate which is why it is able to perform very quietly but on top of that it also has all these knurled controls and buttons on the top that are easy to access and when youre just ready to go and pack it up you can just flip the actual mirror down carry it by its handle and take this with you everywhere and as long as you have the battery charge you can technically just boot this up and start using it wherever you are i also just really like how durable it is because i picture this being in an environment where youre like camping going on a road trip and you might throw this in the car with all the other stuff that you might have so having a setup that is durable and doesnt have to be protected separately is always nice so when it comes to design this is definitely one of the most interesting products that ive checked out recently both in terms of design and functionality and i think its just like a fun product overall that still gives you pretty good levels of performance so if you guys want so if you guys remember on the channel a few months ago i checked out something called the whoop band and that is a health product that has become quite popular and its able to give you great information when it comes to your sleep your hrv your general activity and just insightful health data that i feel like a lot of people are looking to find out more of especially in the past couple years and theres been a ton of options on the market some of them are more ergonomic others are more stylish and others are more accurate and it just really comes down to finding that balance and even though the weap band provided very good information and it has been scientifically tested to have quite a high accuracy one issue that i kind of had with it is that i didnt really like to wear it on the wrist because i typically wear a watch on my right hand because im lefthanded and instead i decided to wear it on my arm and i just found it to be a bit obstructive especially while i was sleeping so one product that also came out recently is the aura ring generation 3 and this is something that ive seen everywhere a lot of my friends in business and in tech seemed to wear one and when i went to the apple event recently i noticed pretty much like a huge majority of people have one as well and the reason why is because it is a ring it is able to fit on just so seamlessly it comes in a lot of nice colors including a gloss black gold silver and also this like matte black option right here and theres also being a gucci collab which even though im someone who like wears a gucci ring and kind of likes that stuff i feel its a bit like out there or weird looking and i personally think it goes very well with just whatever im wearing in like a matte black finish what i like most about this is that it is super light you can just put it on it actually has a sizing kit that they send to you and then you can really figure out what your size is but it is super super light and on top of that a disable will give you insightful information when it comes to sleep your hrv and general activity as well as your recovery score and as someone who travels a ton i feel like that is a very important set of data to have i think theres three key features that i really like about the aura ring one of which being the fact that it knows when you are like exercising for example with automatic activity monitoring because a lot of times i just forget to go into the app and turn it on into like an exercise mode but at the same time i also like the sleep tracking and how its so seamless and also the fact that the battery life is able to last four to seven days and its able to recharge in between 20 and 80 minutes so you dont really have to take it off for that long to ensure that it is charged for the week and that is why i like it but i do know based on some of like the scientific tests the accuracy itself can be a bit back and forth so as i mentioned one of the reasons why i decided to make a cool tech series is because it allows us to check things out in all different categories instead of being limited by price range or like product realm were able to essentially check out stuff in like home tech sports and also in automotive which i feel like is kind of like the pinnacle of technology right now it really does bring together the world of like artificial intelligence connected future but also battery technology and infrastructures around the world and obviously tesla has kind of been the leader of that but all these major car manufacturers that have traditionally been known for like their gas engine cars such as mercedes porsche and audi have kind of put together their experience in design and luxury with a fully electric car so remember we do have the opportunity to check out these cars i always try to take it and our team was in san francisco recently to have the opportunity to drive the new mercedes eqs 580 and that really goes in line with like the mercedes s580 review that we recently did because that was easily the most comfortable car that ive been in um whether its like the driving experience sitting in the back and the eqs 580 was kind of like the futuristic model of that that has like the rounded off look the screen that goes all the way across the selfdriving capabilities and in general literally looked like something out of a movie the ecos 580 starts at a price of 140 000 and it has a equivalent of 516 horsepower and 631 poundfeet of torque on technical terms the screen is 56 inches and its a curved screen that has up to three displays on that dashboard when it comes to speed it has 0 to 60 of 41 seconds and a top speed of 130 miles per hour as for range it can do about 340 miles which i would overall say is pretty respectable and as i mentioned this is just like the start of it theres gonna be many other electric cars that were gonna have the opportunity to check out and each of them have like very different approaches the luxury ones have obviously be something that im interested in because i love german cars the tycon was really fun experience but at the same time from a consumers perspective theres also some very exciting offerings that are coming to the market including from companies like vinfast which bring like a 10 year warranty to the car which for any like current car in the market today is essentially unheard of and with technologies of the future i think were gonna start to see that a lot more often the fact that electric cars and their batteries can be updated improved and also enhanced via software is also like a very interesting idea to me music so perhaps one of the most exciting products that has showed up at the office recently is apples new setup of products i know the studio display is a little bit controversial and for some people its going to be a pretty good value whereas for others its going to be way out of your price range and you just shouldnt look at it on the other hand we have the mac studio and this is something that gets me really excited im still kind of on the fence of whether or not im going to switch over to it completely because i currently use the mac pro and theres a lot of different like parts inside that im trying to figure out if it can work with this workflow but it definitely makes me excited for apples continued future of their own silicon and just how powerful it actually is i could talk about this in a whole video of its own but just look at the computer itself it has the option of the m1 max which is already very powerful as well as the m1 ultra which is essentially two m1 maxes put together and it gives you up to 128 gigs of unified memory on top of that it has up to 64 cores of gpu and 20 cores of cpu and for any video editor out there or anyone who needs a lot of graphics and computing performance in general it is an absolute dream and after using it for a little bit i can tell you that the performance definitely lives up but a lot of people are not going to need to spend that high price point of the m1 ultra because the m1 max is already more than capable some of the other features though include the fact that the back has four thunderbolt ports and even though it does look like a mac mini or nothing like special the four thunderbolt ports all have their own bus which is something that i can definitely benefit from by having so many like hard drives ssds and raid drives connected to a computer at the same time i noticed a lot of times on my mac pro i have an issue with like drive speeds if theres a ton of things connected so by having a separate bus for each one and the thunderbolt speeds that is definitely huge and on top of that everything else is very typical theres like the hdmi you also have your usb ports and this can support up to five displays i believe with three or four of them being the xcr and you can also have like an oled tv but most of the time i would say like two to three displays seems like the typical setup but all in all the mac studio has been really nice to use and at just the fraction of the size of apples pro desktop it is able to beat it in terms of power simply for what i do ive noticed that the optimization in both the software and the chipset has really brought some real world differences when it comes to headphones one thing that im always excited to check out is products that are available in different configuration and form factors to suit specific needs you have the traditional offerings such as inear as well as truly wireless the overyear and onear and theres also options such as the frames which are able to give you a sunglasses or glasses experience this right here is the open run pro from shocks and what i like about it is that if you dont like to have something in your ear while youre running around or walking around town and dont want to be completely disconnected from your surroundings but also from a comfort standpoint want more of like a offyear experience then these bone conduction sport headphones are a great option for you it is essentially a one size fits all you dont have to do any specific adjustments for the fit you just put it around your ear like so and it lines up perfectly and it just feels very light you almost forget that theyre on your ear as it wraps around it doesnt make too much contact and at the same time there are no pressure points so if you decide to go for a run and still want to enjoy whats around you but at the same time have great audio quality and be able to listen your music and do some calls then this is a great solution so for someone who is very active and prioritizes comfort and fit over having that noise cancelling experience and that full seal that isolates you from your surroundings then this is the perfect choice so this next product is one that actually arrived in the office a long time ago but were finally getting around to setting it up and putting it together for one of our editors to use and that is the eve spectrum 4k monitor and whats special about this is that eve is a company that has kind of pushed the boundaries of a product that really focuses specifically on what the consumer wants at prices that are a lot more reasonable than some of the other big name products on the market that have the exact same specs and with the eve spectrum monitor is a 27inch monitor that comes in three different options and it starts in the under 500 range and goes up to 799 for the flagship model that we have right here and either have the choice between a qhd resolution at 144 hertz max refresh rate as well as a qhd 240 hertz or a 4k 240 hertz which is what we have right here and on top of that it is also a display that is ips has a max brightness of 750 nits as well as a one millisecond response time that 240 hertz that we mentioned and also nvidia gsync support it also does have a p3 color gamut so as someone who does like a lot of video editing and photo editing that is always very useful and the max brightness is definitely appreciated as well and at a price of 799 especially if you have to like outfit an office in these it is way more affordable and a much better value than something like obviously a pro display xdr and on top of that it does also have hdr support if that is something that youre going to take advantage of in gaming and also in editing so something else that we also picked up recently is a dji mavic 3 drone i believe it was first announced about six months ago and to be honest ive been away from drones for quite a few years now i simply havent had the need for them but now with a team that is capable of flying drones and with the travel films coming back i figured itd be a good time to pick one up and go ahead and integrate it into some of our content just to add another dimension so with the new mavic 3 it has quite a few features that i specifically care about when it comes to image quality for starters the sensor is a lot larger its a four thirds hasselblad cmos sensor and its able to capture in a much better image quality but at the same time you have manual aperture control you can also record in 51 k you have options for pro res the 128 stops of dynamic range and you can also record in d log 10 bit as someone who started grading a lot of footage in the past couple years its really nice to be able to have as much data as possible and by being able to record at up to 200 megabits per second in its bit rate i at least have a good amount of latitude that when the drone footage comes back were able to grade it accordingly and balancing it out and also integrate it into the videos with all the other cameras that are on the ground very smoothly i think thats always been kind of my main priority with drones um the ease of flight but also the image quality elements and i always felt like there was like a compromise between one another back when i was really into drones in like 2015 on the other hand though this is still like a very compact size it comes in at under 900 grams in its overall weight and the battery life is also improved to over 45 minutes which is a huge jump from like the 20 minutes that i used to get on my older models i also really like the slight update to the remote i just feel like its a lot easier to grip and at the same time you still have your phone stand here that is just a lot more solid than before none of that folding stuff it comes with a nice carrying case and overall and were definitely excited to use this a lot more as we integrate it into our general lifestyle and tech content but otherwise thank you guys so much for watching this video and if you enjoyed it as always make sure you go ahead and

SiefJJv-Qho,latte art for beginners how to pour heart latte art tutorial,Art,in this video we will show you how to pour a basic lateral design the heart and i believe its the most fundamental latte art pattern to learn so lets start with that one the base of a nicely poured heart is a perfectly steamed milk if youre just starting with lottery art and you didnt steam milk before you can watch our previous video where we went through milk steaming step by step today well go through all the tiny hand movements axis tilting speed and more ill share with you some tips that helped me to survive all my barista weekends when i bought hundreds of cappuccinos flat whites and lattes as a bonus in the end well share with you how you can train latte art without wasting milk and coffee now that you have pulled an espresso shot and the milk is perfectly steamed without any large bubbles pouring has basically two phases face number one mixing the milk with the espresso face number two pouring the designer it all looks very cool and easy but it reminds me a lot of learning how to play a guitar all the hand positions and small movements are easier to do when you train them separately and in slow motion that would be a key advice if youre just starting with the latte art the slower the training the stronger is getting the socalled muscle memory try to be very conscious of what you do how you hold things and how you pour phase one mixing the milk with the espresso as lance hendrick from onyxcoffee said think of the espresso base as of a canvas you want to stretch the canvas all over the cup so the paint can hold on it by mixing the espresso with a drop of milk we create a much more stable surface for the latter design were filling up approximately one third to a half of the cup with milk and mixing it all together were doing so because the espresso behaves like an oil liquid if we just pour straight on top of the espresso the milk pattern wont hold its shape and the design would lack contrast very important when we pour we need to hit the espresso hard so the milk touches the bottom of the cup goes back to the surface and mixes with the crema all around this is how to do it hold the cup in your less dominant hand you can hold it in your palm like this or you can preferably hold it by the handle the handle should be right in front of your chest pointing to you this way you make sure that the final design is perfectly symmetric and when you put it on the table it faces the customer now were gonna tilt the cup with the espresso by 30 to 40 degrees towards the spout you want to see the liquids almost touching the edge of the cup as you can see the espresso now sits both between the wall and on the bottom of the cup we create more depth in the liquid which is very important for the first pour now were gonna take the pitcher with the milk grab the pitcher by your dominant hand you can grab the picture like this you can grab it at the bottom or you can grab it by the handle it doesnt matter find your way in a position where you feel in control you want to be able to steadily control the flow of the milk hold the pitcher tilt the cup towards the spout twist the wrist with the pitcher and pour rather aggressively along the vertical axis straight to the point where the cup is tilted move from side to side all around the cup that helps you to mix the milk with the espresso properly fill approximately half of the cup by pouring along the vertical axis turn the cup back into the horizontal position and swirl with the milk and espresso were doing that to get rid of the color of the crema which disrupts the contrast of the design you can also use spoon to mix the coffee with the milk if you struggle with the hand movement i still like to use the spoon as it is very effective when you get good at swelling motion you can start doing it simultaneously while pouring but that is more advanced now weve stretched the canvas and were ready to paint in phase two were literally almost touching the surface of the coffee with the spout bottom of the picture goes up and all around phase two the pitcher is touching the rim of the cup very important the tip of the spout is in the middle of the cup the whole time following the vertical axis as it defaults glued to it now we need to paint the design on our canvas to do that were adding a new motion and that is wiggling you can do it with your elbow like this or you can do it with your wrist being loose like this a small chip for wiggling when you train the motion with just the water and the cup soon youll get the feeling into your hands ice on the tip of the spout the spout is inside the cup nearly touching the coffee now start wiggling with the jug from left to right stay at the vertical axis stay in the middle of the cup make sure you dont travel with a pitcher as youre filling up the cup start tilting the cup back to its horizontal position take your time make your life easier there is no need to rush this part the cup is full raise the pitcher up and cut through make sure you rise up at least 10 centimeters a common mistake is cutting through the design too low where the stream is too thick and it destroys the pattern you need a thin stream of milk and for that you need height again lets show it again with milk and in slow motion swill with the jug destroy all visible bubbles tilt the cup towards the spout 30 to 40 degrees phase one pour quickly under the espresso along the vertical axis start and finish in the center fill the cup to the half mix the base canvas is ready phase two go down with the spout lower edge touching the cup tip of the spout almost touching the coffee stay at the axis wiggle from left to right maintain the same speed do not rush level the cup to horizontal position as its getting full stay in the middle the cup is full raise the pitcher about 15 centimeters up cut the design in half the heart is done result unified texture no visible bubbles symmetric design shiny surface a high contrast no blurry parts taste wise delicious bonus round i didnt want to scare you in the beginning of the video but it takes a while before being able to pour a design like that the purpose of this video was sharing a shortcut with you to a great result now just two more tips for the training itself instead of using milk fill the pitcher with cold water and add a drop of detergent steam it as you would steam the milk instead of a shot of espresso you can use diluted cacao powder which is much cheaper the result might be more bubbly or not perfect dont worry about that these tips are here to help you with your movements and muscle memory and to eliminate waste what do you think did you find this video helpful did you find something that doesnt work for you perhaps you have some tips on how to pour latte out too let us know in the comments in the next video we will look at pouring specific latter designs like rosetta or a tulip have a great day and ill see you in the next video music

only two people have died since we landed so funny that literally only a quarter of the lobby capacity has entered a game its so weird it is so weird well like that music okay did not expect to get a win like that but ill freaking take it theres no point in adding commentary to nonexistent gameplay im not sure no thats not a thing come back here really he just keeps going he helped out can i win

by jumping i think we can all agree that that should have been my kill so i have three kills now got him really happy with that seven people in this relatively small circle oh im not even in the circle i just noticed i can imagine winning a game of firestorm in 2022 the fact that i didnt kill him extremely bs if you ask me somebody has a tank no dont do this to me there it is theres a tank if he just sees me i am dead whoa yeah okay i saw it just in the nick of time bro oh oh thats not fair there are just a bunch of freaking campers thats one thats two by fours galore oh ill get you up i dont really know what happened right there dont think i didnt see you there buddy what the hell where the hell did you come from maybe i should switch to another gun although this does the job okay so far the ls26 is doing great no recoil i love it let me use this maybe this will get me some kills okay i got him with the fat quality as well there we go the head that wasnt directed there we go another same target the stationary weapon over there this is a good position but im gonna get sniped any second oh what the hell there we go yeah he he was 100 dead well somebody is there well try to get him okay there you go ill help you out buddy im actually gonna be a good support player this time give me some cover there you go have fun music hey thats good at least i got him yeah yeah i know how to get me oh too many people here too many people i have to retreat and get a better position come on there he is i think they have a spawn beacon here or something where i didnt even oh he was hiding over the classic battlefield 5 there we go we won this one i like that i guess thats about it for the video hope you guys enjoyed let me know down below what you want to see me play next of course like subscribe all that good stuff check the discord link is down below and with that being said i see you guys next time music music you

lets fill my beer look how pretty the water is guys music isnt it gorgeous guys look how busy this beach is so crazy me and ty are taking a cruise almost threw me i will sue you so im just kidding were taking a ride through the neighborhood just checking out i really like this house let me show you here okay i love this yeah you want house yeah i want it well you have a different one look at the pond isnt that gorgeous i love the sunset here yeah also someone in the neighborhood lost their kitten so im currently trying to find their wow were looking for their cat and we may take it home ourselves yeah i gotta i got a picture of the cat so im trying to yeah we are we are so son kids honey weve been in the sun for three days straight i almost hit a curb looking at it and uh ill ill report back if we find the cat im really bad about reporting back on the vlog though laurens gonna take the cat home absolutely absolutely did find a raccoon and thats all i found and youre not taking him home laura oh my goodness i want to take him home hows he gonna get oh yeah hes getting in the water no hes not oh my god jesse is he doesnt like it but he does it im obsessed guys we just finished eating breakfast and now were on our way to the airport we accidentally left erin accidentally im just getting shes hanging back shes got some time off this summer shes gonna go back and spend some time with a lot of family members and do things there so yeah were off to the airport but first i just need to stop you guys know i need to stop and get a darker pepper where did we eat breakfast breakfast at another broken egg another broken egg it was good i got the chicken and waffles i got biscuits and he said theyre really good but their dr pepper was just like soda water i dont know if you soda drinkers out there know whenever you get like a fountain drink in it theres no syrup its just all soda water thats what it was so were just gonna give me my dr pepper for the day laura likes that extra scissors i do i am ready okay listen im ready to go home and see my cats but we both agreed we could have done one more day here weve been here since thursday to monday four days i could have done five oh and thats thats saying something for laura guys because i dont like to be going long that means she really loves these florida beaches always ready to go home after day four on a trip im like really ready to come home after day three im typically itching you know i got the itch to get back home but after day four im like all right lets wrap it up but today im like damn if you just bring your cats with you oh i would be good then were just moving seriously id be good if if i have my cats with me like i dont need to be home at all ever um its the cats but my assistant um i always get so many questions what do you do to your cats and im the same way because like whenever i see people leave their animals i get like i cant help it i just get a little concerned but actually we have house sitters that dont just check in on our cats but they watch our whole house they dont leave they stay there the entire time sleep at our house and make sure everythings good dont like to leave our house alone period and yoshi is sensitive and she likes someone to sleep with her ill insert a picture here of booboo yoshi from the cat sitter the house sitter what they sent im ready to see my publish and girl miss hair its just like crooked im gonna miss aaron but im happy that shes able to go back to her roots and like get out of la a little bit and thats whats talking to her about like its really healthy to escape from the hustle and bustle of la its funny because erin usually comes back like a very shes very grateful when she gets home exactly any time we send her all day and then whenever shes in la for a long time shes really moody and like frustrated and thats what it does to you its such a hustle and bustle its like literally the opposite of laid back and like yeah its really good to get out so thats why we wanted her to spend some time with family she wanted to see family too so but anyways were off to the airport and then back to la we go taste it its yummy does it hit it thank you so much you too thank you sarah music its 30 pm the vlog starts at 6 30 im with the girls girls im with the girl manny ate too much you okay six months in yeah thats what i feel like we all just ate tay show we always eat there that is so good honey those shishito peppers yes were all so stuffed crispy rice were in a i think i did too we always overdo it there its hard not to it is it is but were on our way to my house the sun is so funny its like its like cutting me off at the mouth were on our way in my house and then were going to go to a halsey concert correct hell yeah about face event very that slash concert so uh it should be pretty fun im gonna vlog there a little tonight you know the logo log music what are you doing what are you doing what are you doing youre scaring us youre scaring the vlog yeah hello vlog its me again im back from the beginning of the vlog do you remember whenever i was in the beginning of this vlog well im back we are still running errands we just vacuumed out our car got it all nice and clean i got breakfast we dropped off some stuff were getting gas were basically doing anything we can to not be in our house right now although i have a lot of work i got to do whenever i get home but you know id rather not i knew this was coming i knew this bathroom renovation was coming im so excited for it but ive been talking about it forever as you guys know but i knew it was going to challenge me on another level with the noise i also you guys know my pet peeve is loud like noises like really loud noises and so i feel like this is just me challenging myself to work in a chaotic environment okay do you have any quarters no you need air for the tire yeah do you have like a dollar i do have a dollar cash actually you could break it real quick thank you thats that snack also jesse sent me her new shades they came out with white and blue i really like this blue color what do you guys think how do they look on me i have a crooked nose and crooked ears so you know we always have to finesse a little bit but i think these are really cute um im thinking i need a blue blazer with this though like a cobalt blue blazer would be a good moment its a dollar 25 they went up inflation i swear to god do you have another dollar yeah you do what happened i decided we have an air pump at the house im not gonna waste my time on my money are you gonna actually put air on the tire when i get to the house i am okay william bam decisions ive made do we have anywhere else to stop no we dont want to go home crazy things so loud there i know were going back home the sound of jackhammering his nightmares music

HdwzJLTLFqc,biologist answers biology questions from twitter  tech support  wired,Tech, and youre okay with the full frontal on this well let the twitterverse comment on it hi im thor hanson author and biologist today im here to answer your questions on twitter this is biology support upbeat music jerrepeeters asks are viruses alive let me answer that question with another question what does it mean to be alive most biologists define life as an organism with cells that respond to their environment and an organism that can reproduce itself viruses dont meet that definition because they do not have cells they reproduce only by coopting the reproductive capabilities of a living cell yet we see viruses having a very direct impact on our lives and the lives of other creatures in this world so it just goes to show us that the very definition of life is still in some ways open to question subnomnomnom asks why are succulents such finicky little bitches a succulent plant lives in a particular condition out in the wild where they have adapted to really dry situations where they need to hold a lot of water in their leaves and those are difficult conditions to replicate inside your house which is part of the reason they can be very difficult to keep as houseplants heyadrienne asks seeds are interesting who knew that when you eat one youre eating little plant embryos its hard to imagine how small a seed can be until you meet the seeds of an orchid these come from a small orchid in our flora called the spotted coralroot and each seed is like a mote of dust only a few cells organized together there are approximately 1 million spotted coralroot seeds in this vial which stands in stark contrast to the worlds largest seed the double coconut which grows on palm trees found only on two islands in the seychelles archipelago isolated out in the middle of the indian ocean and a fullsized double coconut can weigh 40 pounds 11 orders of magnitude larger than an orchid seed so ask yourself where else in nature can you find something so different in form that has the same function rbatra01 asks does darwins theory of evolution apply to plants also yes hunglee asks dumb question time do you think archaeopteryx would have made a good pet this replica of an archaeopteryx fossil hangs on the wall in my office and i look at it every day and biologists have been looking at this fossil for over 150 years some call it the rosetta stone of biology because it contains so much information about evolution and it reveals a creature that displays characteristics of reptiles and of birds this is one of the first fossils that gave people an inkling that in fact the birds are living dinosaurs look at the mouth of it up close you would see little teeth it is what some people at the time it was discovered called evidence of a missing link if you will evidence of evolution in progress we know that it lived in the trees if you look at the feathers they are like modern feathers offset and aerodynamic on the wings which indicates it was soaring or flapping at the time so it would have been a messy pet to have around in the house knocking things over and so forth and it mightve given you a nasty bite because it had teeth overall its such an important creature that i think any biologist would love to have one as a pet jonmacelive sent a picture with a question bones found while walking in the woods any idea of what it was bigger than my 50 lb dog you are looking at the skeleton of a deer and if you look closely you will see that something is missing from that skeleton you have the top of the skull and it so happens that i have the jawbone from a deer skull right here this part has teeth in the front but if you were to go back in the woods and look at the top of that skull you would find just a bony plate no top teeth on a deer they are pinchandtear herbivores meaning they pinch the vegetation with their bottom teeth against that bony plate and then tear it off so you can always tell when youre out in your garden whether its been a deer attacking your favorite shrubbery or whether its been something like a rabbit that makes a clean cut because deer always leave a rough cut on the end of the vegetation that theyve been nibbling rjzenith asks can dogs and foxes be crossbred or are they too different so dogs and foxes are in different what biologists or taxonomists would call genera they have a different genus theyre not closely related theyre very very distant cousins they cannot interbreed and produce viable offspring whereas dogs and wolves are closely related in fact dogs descend from wolves they were domesticated from wild wolves only 40000 years ago which isnt that long in evolutionary time so those two can definitely hybridize and they often do ndeaalese16 asks like how the hell did a fish just get up one day and say i wanna walk on land and now here we are like it just miraculously turns its gills to lungs and can walk even though we cant say precisely what things were like at that critical moment that there are creatures in the world that still display some of those characteristics there are creatures called lungfish which can crawl short distances through the mud to get from one pool to another we are all familiar with that cartoon image of evolution with the creature emerging from the water and then progressing through a series of forms until theres a human being at the end its the most destructive cartoon in the history of science because it gives us this false idea that evolution is a linear progression of one form replacing the other along the path when in fact its much messier more complex and more wonderful than that so yes there was some creature that first began to emerge from those watery depths onto land but that led to a great diversity of different pathways once that transition took place  startsole asks how will the human species evolve the future of our species is a big question and open to question but we know a lot about human evolution from looking at the past and the story of human evolution is really in many ways the story of brain size and each time weve seen some increase in the capacity of our brains biologists and anthropologists have associated that with some change in human behavior that allowed us to gain more calories because brain tissue is what physiologists call metabolically expensive it takes a lot of fuel to run a brain as many as 20 of our daily calories go to fuel something thats only 2 of our body weight so if you want a bigger brain youre going to have to have more calories to run it and weve seen that through time as our species has adopted new characteristics new traits new habits that have given us more to eat those things include tool use and social behaviors and cooking the food so now we are at a period of time where food for many people is plentiful calories are plentiful one question for future biologists then will be how did that change the human brain flybehaviour asks mutant corn for dinner anyone know what mutation would likely cause the double sized kernels well we dont know if its a mutation at all because sometimes corn or other plants respond in strange ways like that to disease or bacteria or fungi so we cant say whats making those colonels large in that situation but whoever gets that ear for dinner will have a bonus cherylrofer asks can crispr save bananas from the fungal threat serious question for biology tweeps its a serious question for anyone who loves bananas the common banana that we buy in the grocery store is called the cavendish banana and unlike many other fruits in the store the cavendish bananas are not produced from seeds and traditional crop breeding a banana plant produces offshoots that are easy to separate from that plant that are clones of the banana plant itself so if you find a banana that has the characteristics that will be successful commercially it lasts a long time it has good flavor you can ship it around the world to grocery stores that is a truly valuable fruit and thats why the cavendish banana is so popular and why its produced via cloning so when there is a threat like this fungus that lives in the soil and it destroys the cavendish banana plant theyre all susceptible to that fungus in the same way crispr is a tool in molecular biology thats used for turning on or turning off particular genes within the genome of a species so if there is a gene currently turned off in the cavendish banana that could be turned on again to provide resistance that is a possible solution to this problem acella asks friday debate in the office do plants grow from the bottom or the top well typically plants grow from the top but there are situations that were very familiar with where that growing part of the plant is lowered down and we see that in our own lawns grasses have evolved to grow from the bottom in response to grazing by animals and more recently by the cutting of lawnmowers so that that leaf that you see when we cut it off will be replaced from below but most plants like a fir tree or an apple tree are growing from the tips of their shoots kbaumlier asks how does climate change affect wildlife we often summarize the impacts of climate change on plants and animals with the acronym mad short for move adapt or die and we see examples of all three of those playing out in nature all around us between 25 and 85 of species on this planet are now moving shifting their ranges in response to climate change looking for the temperatures and conditions that theyre used to many other species are adapting by changing diets or behaviors to try to cope with this crisis and yes some species are dying and going extinct and we also see species struggling to adapt and adjust their relationships to one another a fascinating example recently out of gabon in africa where for the first time scientists observed chimpanzees attacking a group of gorillas and in fact even killing one of the gorillas one of the reasons this may be happening one of the theories is that there is now a shortage of fruit and other foods for those creatures in that forest because of climate change creating a new hyper competitive environment for those two species that used to coexist peacefully nekomiller asks blue eyes are weird what is af im sorry how do i  production crew member uh production crew member laughs beep  oh as beep can i say that or what do i say nekomiller asks blue eyes are weird af like honestly how does a mutation like that even happen mutations in biology occur in the dna when its being copied its not a perfect process mistakes are made oftentimes those mistakes lead to new features in the organism usually theyre not very useful and they disappear over time but sometimes they can impart a benefit and they persist this is one of the fundamental ways that new traits are introduced into the evolutionary process blue eyes were introduced in that way fairly recently in human evolution they have persisted but no ones quite sure yet what the advantage of blue eyes may be tarrahluzuriaga asks how do extinct species come back to the world short answer they dont theyre extinct but there are efforts underway now to try to recreate or bring back some extinct species like the wooly mammoth from ancient dna its still a work in progress a long way off but some experts are working on that very question laurenrpeters asks if we have evolved from monkeys why are they not extinct mm when new species evolve its not necessary for them to replace the species they evolved from in fact its more common for new species to exist sidebyside with many closelyrelated species karu1402 asks is the number of genetically different human beings that can be formed finite people are often curious if there might be a doppelganger someone almost exactly like them out there in the world today or at some point in history and the fact is we can be pretty close genetically but every individual is indeed unique when you consider the number of genes in the human genome 20000 30000 but also considering the number of base pairs in those dna molecules youre talking about billions of different combinations on top of that its not just the genes themselves that are crucial but how those genes are expressed all of those things can be different among individuals were not going to run out of unique individuals anytime soon ibisjournal asks what makes penguin feathers iceproof theyre not just iceproof they are waterproof structurally waterproof and biologists still arent sure exactly how that works but if you look microscopically at the veins of those feathers you see that they trap all sorts of small air pockets and it may be that air preventing water moving through the feather that intricate feather vein has thousands and thousands of individual places where the feather surface is pushing against the natural surface tension of the water either way you dont have to worry about penguins getting wet on their skin rheisman asks what are some of your favorite unsolved mysteries in biology interpret however you like one of the great mysteries that weve really only discovered somewhat recently is just how mysterious our own genome is when the human genome project sequenced our dna i think many people thought we would have the recipe book for how to make a human being but it turned out to be far more complicated than anyone thought because its not just the sequence of the genome but its the shape of the molecule its the genes its the patches of dna around the genes that control them its all sorts of things that combine to see how those genes are expressed and what makes us human but you dont even have to go into molecular genetics to find mysteries theyre all around us a constant reminder that theres so much to learn about ourselves and about nature consider something as familiar to all of us as yawning we still dont understand why people yawn michaelmccollor asks how did darwin know all that evolution stuff he didnt know he learned it as he traveled and explored his world because in the 19th century it was still widely assumed that everything was created very recently if you will by the hand of god and so darwin was fascinated by geology and how there were species in the rocks in fossils that were no longer present in the modern world he came up with the idea of evolution by natural selection would help explain how things changed through time and how you had this great diversity of life on the planet and it was a radical idea at the time he sat on it for years and years before finally publishing his theories because he knew they would be controversial lonelykino asks what is bioethics the ethics of biology the answer is yes and we need to think about the ethics of biology as our ability to do more and more develops over time technologically we have the ability now to change dna we have the ability to combine species in new ways so we must constantly ask ourselves not only can we do these things but should we so those are all the questions for today and weve covered a lot of ground thank you for watching biology support cymbal crashes

all right so maybe not ivy league but were a solid safety school and best of all we have a 100 acceptance rate the only step in the application process hitting the subscribe button right now 56 percent of you arent subscribed so wed like to boost those application numbers to join honor roll all you need to do is turn on notifications and boy will you be thankful that you enrolled into the channel today because im gonna make you rich and it all boils down to fast food chicken see back in november of 2020 i did a video all about mcdonalds exposing the fact that its not a fast food company but instead takes most of its money in via real estate which seems odd when you consider what those golden arches are best known for the basic gist of it all is that when someone applies to open a mcrestaurant mcdonalds gets to choose the location they will then ensure that they own the land and building that the restaurant is going into why would they care about that well it means that for every new restaurant that gets opened mcdonalds gets to collect a franchise fee of around 45 000 as well as a cut of all food sales made which are the sorts of things that youd expect out of a deal like this but it also means that they collect rent from their franchisees and that is where the real money starts to roll in its an arrangement that ultimately works out pretty well for both parties mcdonalds earns rent and a cut of food sales and the franchisee walks away with a yearly salary around five percent of what they sell per year this results in about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars provided they sell three million in gross sales thats the rough average per year of mickey d sales here in the us not too shabby right this idea of a fast food brand essentially leasing out their restaurants known as the sonoborn model has been wildly successful so successful in fact that most fast food chains in the us use it but some are apparently more difficult to get access to than others case in point chickfila according to online reports getting to be the owner of one of these restaurants is simultaneously easier and harder than every single one of these other ones combined in fact as the story goes you have a better chance of getting accepted into a prestigious college like harvard than you do of owning a chickfila but thats just the story right it cant be true so you know what i wanted to look into the statistics is becoming a restaurant franchisee a better path than going to college is slinging sandwiches gonna make you rich well i watched hours of interviews and read the 403 page franchise disclosure document to find out exactly that and uh well consider today your chicken sciences 101 credit what makes chickfila so different from everyone else can passing out poultry pack your pockets those my friends are questions that are absolutely gonna be on the final exam and no you cannot take this class as pass fail thank you first lets take a look at what it means to be a fast food franchisee as i mentioned before the first step is paying the franchise fee a onetime cost that varies wildly from chain to chain mcdonalds is on the higher end of this requiring you to pay 45 000 but places like subway are much lower clocking in at 15k chickfila meanwhile is the lowest of anyone with a rockbottom fee of only 10 000 and even that is an overstatement because half of it basically functions as a security deposit if you treat your restaurant nice you get that 5k refunded to you when youre done with the company so off the bat things are looking pretty nice for chickfila but the real challenge to becoming a franchise owner is to even start the process these companies will look into your personal net worth to see whether you can be trusted with their brand they arent just gonna let anyone own those golden arches they have a reputation to uphold they need to ensure that you can be trusted to keep that ice cream machine broken at all costs subway once again is on the cheaper end of the spectrum only requiring a net worth of eighty thousand dollars mcdonalds requires a net worth of five hundred thousand wendys is actually crazy high requiring a 5 million net worth with 2 million of that being in what they call liquid assets basically assets that can be converted to cash in a short amount of time that is a huge barrier to entry if getting to own a chickfila is harder than getting into harvard then the net worth requirement has to be crazy for this thing right well to start off operating a chickfila you have to have a net worth of literally doesnt matter theres no requirement so the fees the lowest and theres no net worth requirement so what makes it so hard to get a chickfila i mean chickfila is also the highest grossing of any of these franchises qsr in the food industry stand for quick service restaurant and the magazine qsr which reports on the industry tends to track the performance of the 50 largest qsr chains according to their data an average chickfila restaurant crushes it in sales raking in a staggering 5 million dollars per year no one even comes close to that number mcdonalds comes in at 3 million starbucks at 12 taco bell at 16 and higher sales usually mean higher earnings for the owner of the franchise so whats the big catch with chickfila there has got to be some sort of trick here right well the problem isnt actually money its interviews you cant just walk in with ten thousand dollars and be given a restaurant instead you have to apply and this process can take anywhere from 12 to 24 months and thats not even just one person out of bad experience numbers that is what chickfila themselves openly admit in their application video though it can go shorter as this operator admits in utah ive gone through about five rounds of interviews so that was about a about an eight month process how can a process deciding if youre good enough to run a restaurant take that long well when you expect your applicants to write 12 essays in order to qualify suddenly the timing starts to make a little sense you also have to submit your high school transcripts in short the comparison to getting into college is much more applicable than you might initially think but is it truly as hard as harvard well i ran the numbers harvard university in massachusetts is currently rated as the second best college in the us the application process only takes a few months much shorter compared to chickfila it requires you to write four essays as opposed to 12 and you have to attend one or two interviews compared to five or more but of course just because youre doing less work it doesnt make harvard any easier to get into and youd be right about that in 2021 just over 40 000 students applied to harvard and of those only 2056 were accepted which gives them an acceptance rate of 514 pretty low odds so lets compare that to chickfila ive seen stats saying that anywhere between twenty thousand and sixty thousand people express interest in becoming a franchisee every year and of those do you want to guess how many people actually make the cut 80 last year it appears to have been just over a hundred that is an acceptance rate between point one and point five percent not one percent point one ten times lower than harvards acceptance rate heck that is lower than your chance of becoming a secret service agent at one percent even lower than becoming an employee at google at point two three percent it is an insane statistic but surely a harvard degree is gonna get you more money right nah probably not according to the statistics that i found graduates from harvard on average earn a hundred thousand dollars per year six years after they leave the school theyre up to about 150 000 per year after 10 again compare that to what we talked about earlier when it comes to mcdonalds owning a single average performing franchise will net you about 150 000 per year but thats just mcdonalds like i mentioned chickfila restaurants tend to be much higher earning with an average restaurant last year selling five million dollars per store assuming you take home five percent of your gross revenue that amounts to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars per year as your salary and again thats off of an initial onetime ten thousand dollar investment yearly tuition at harvard meanwhile is a 54 000 per year investment so before youre even able to get out into that job market youre already in the hole 216k so getting into chickfila is not only harder but its also cheaper and likely more profitable than getting into harvard that said id be very irresponsible if i didnt call out some stipulations here chickfila does the franchise thing very differently from the rest of the service industry remember how everyone else requires you to have a massive net worth to get started well thats because you as the franchisee are expected to buy everything to get your restaurant off the ground all the equipment materials whatever its all on you chickfila meanwhile takes care of all of that so you dont need to be sitting on a scrooge mcduckie and pile of wealth to get started and while that certainly sounds generous in theory in food theory it means that chickfila actually owns everything you dont own a darn thing in that restaurant if you decide to pack up shop itll all go back to chickfila and you walk away with nothing you cant even pass it on to your family you arent really an owner hence why the job title here is operator meanwhile if youre home to coast just buy a franchise to hire someone else to run the whole thing nope not allowed chickfila expects franchisees to be very handson with their restaurant and refuses to let operators have any other business ventures i guess theyd frown on me making youtube videos about them while i also ran one of their locations and you do have to be handson reading everything that i could about franchising restaurants everyone seems to agree on that regardless of the franchise youre talking about if youre the owner you are constantly supervising every element of the business there is no rest when employees are going in and out of this thing like a revolving door so youre working hard for all the money youre earning the upside for owners of places like mcdonalds is that in success most owners are able to operate multiple locations which allows them to generate some fat stacks 150 000 from a single restaurant per year yeah its great but 150k per year from seven restaurants oh now youre talking however unlike other fast food franchises you cant do that at chickfila you have to earn your way up to merit too and at max maybe three chickfila locations why are they so different because they dont want franchisees to just be people with lots of money sitting around in an office they want people that are handson if you become a franchisee you are signing yourself up for a six day a week position running the restaurant and when you think about the chickfila model relative to the other models of qsrs that you visit it actually makes sense i mean i can only speak anecdotally but in general i eat a lot of fast food and i notice when things in the restaurant arent really run well chickfila tends to get fewer orders wrong run more efficiently and have consistent service at least at all the places that i visit here in north carolina and california this is because the franchise operators are there all the time breathing down their employees necks micromanaging checking in everything good for consumers like me no doubt but i also imagine its probably a lot more stressful to be an employee in that sort of environment thats in contrast to most of the mcdonalds locations that i visit whose employees occasionally saunter over to the cash register and where theres a literal 25 accuracy on my order the model certainly isnt the best for me as the consumer but its certainly great for the franchise owner whos sitting on a mountain of cash somewhere from their 10 franchises it also encourages the mcdonalds brand to spread everywhere being as wide as it possibly can be because everyone wants to open one and they can open dozens my point in all of this is that theres so much that we dont see under the surface of the restaurants that we go to every day or just me going to every day its its probably just me right the question is if you can own a qsr restaurant should you or are you better off going to harvard well in an interesting twist the answer is yeah own the restaurant you start making money as a franchise owner immediately rather than waiting four years and home to get an entrylevel job to start chipping away at your debt and even at six years out of college when your experience trumps your education anyway franchise owners are still likely making a higher average salary than the average harvard graduate again with less debt and now with an incredibly substantial resume item owning and running their own business after four years of being a franchise owner you can go on to run other types of restaurants you can open up more of your current restaurant you can go into highend management positions at companies or start your own brand new business with your profits after four years at harvard you can finally move out of your 160 square foot dorm grab as much out of your parents fridge in connecticut as you can get away with and line up for an entrylevel job somewhere somehow bizarrely this doesnt even seem to be a close race even as a guy who went to a fancy pants college i am now thinking that i should have picked up a subway instead at the end of the day college tends to teach concepts in theory and you know i love me some theories but being a franchise owner teaches concepts by experience which means that youre not just earning a living youre learning a living which is pretty much the ideal but hey maybe all this

IGLjv1DkpU8,winston the french bulldog wins the nonsporting group  westminster kennel club  fox sports,Sport,the nonsporting group was one of the original two groups when dogs were first categorized over a century ago eventually the toy and working dogs would split off from the nonsporting group which now has 21 diverse breeds and varieties and these dogs have the style for show business the poodle is elegant the bichon frise is spunky and the lhasa opso looks like a hollywood star with that coat and you may find the next best in show winner here westminsters top honor has gone to a nonsporting dog in two of the last four years music our thanks to melissa rivers host of the podcast group text and her book lies my mother told me daughter of the legendary comedian joan rivers who a dog lover she once joked the dogs were better companions than a husband because they didnt leave the seat up thats the comedian joan rivers two groups complete two more tonights back to michael music may we have the nonsporting group in the ring please applause music 21 breeds and varieties 12 best in show wins most recently the standard poodle 2020 season coming from this group thats right not far before that was of course flynn to be shot so we have had some really top dogs and the french bulldog in this group noted by the american kennel club is the most popular nonsporting breed and number two most popular breed overall and of course tonight we know that the number one ranked dog all breeds but that doesnt you know this is westminster weve seen anything in it so and there is winston the french bulldog and of course this group has so many sizes and shapes and backgrounds its really interesting interesting and as a judge of the nonsporting group you have to learn all these different styles of dogs because basically that one is the same as the others evelyn gregory from louisville kentucky debuted as a sixyearold handler of russell griffons and boxers leading to junior showmanship and this is her third judging assignment at westminster yeah and evelyn and i grew up in the sport together we competed in the toy group i had the maltese she had the griffon she was a wonderful competitor and her father also was a judge here as well miss evelyn gregory who we introduced a moment ago rounding out the entire group here 21 breeds and varieties well the crowd cannot influence the jokes correct no no she knows what shes doing and you know its interesting we talk about evelyn you know she just lost her father im sure joe gregory and hes hes he was a wonderful man he was a he was a boxer handler his her mother actually had maltese shown by peggy hogg who trained tim lehman who won the toy group with his maltese so its really interesting to see how our connections go throughout the sport but we really missed joking please have the sharp pay right up here applause a lot of active breeds in this group applause yeah this pumpkin the dalmatian could i please have the tibetan spaniel the tibetan terrier and the show low thank you thank you everybody please push back thank you can somebody knock off the french bulldog winston that weve been talking about all night as the number one overall ladies and gentlemen please one at a time and please come right back to your original spot you know and this is where if shes wavering between one or two dogs this this can change their mind because she really wants to see their reach and drive and their carriage going around the ring and thats what were really looking for we dont worry if they break their gate or something like that but we want to see their overall outline and profile thank you now shes aware that winston came in with all the accolades correct the judges are aware of whos ranked and whos doing it but certainly theyre aware of it theyve probably judged some of these dogs in the past but it doesnt really affect you because you know you have to judge them on the game and its against their competition that night could i please have the french bulldogs applause here we go one last chance thank you very much for 20 000 in second westminster nonsporting group winner is the french bulldog and the dalmatian tibetan applause very excited to see him as hes going to advance to best in show tomorrow you know i got to support that because i have a winston at home with my whipit so shout out to winston at home your namesake just won the nonsporting group you know when you talk about a family of dog owners weve kept repeating the owner and nfl player defensive end morgan fox who plays for the chargers carolina panther and la ram and very proud and loves working with dogs and exposing them to families and children the westminster kettle club dog show is brought to you by coaster quinn joint health supplements the brand used the most by pet parents lets check in the show ring with jamie little once again perry and winston you guys had to show earlier today how does this dog keep that spunk and enthusiasm in the ring its amazing as his genetics this is father his mom everything back there in the pedigrees yes youve shown a lot of dogs french bulldogs tell us what is so special about winston here on a french bulldog its all about shape and type right so the ears you want a big bad ear which is like 111 on a clock thats what he has you want the almond i mean sorry the round eye which he has but then if you look on the structure you want the neck to go into the wither and hear the upper arm right here and then where the rise is right here is the highest point at the end of the ribcage to give you the hip joint right there so youre saying hes perfect and hes got a heck of a personality too jenny winston sure lived up to the hype wow what a finish from

WAWXj3GE9Tg,supreme court allows biden to end remain in mexico policy,News, dana all right thank you so much andy standby here we are waiting for remain in mexico policy i believe we have that decision in shannon bream are you here  yes this is a long one but we are getting through this it looks like the chief justice john roberts and justice kavanaugh joined with the liberal three justices for a 54 decision in favor of the biden decision for now for this one is complicated the governments decision of that remain in mexico policy did not violate federal law they say this october 29th memorandum to try to get rid of this remain in mexico policy didnt constitute final agency actions but reversing the court of appeals was decided against the biden administration sending this case back down for further proceedings this is a win at first blush at firstrate overview for the biden administration that has been trying to get rid of remain in mexico policy  for now it looks like a five hundred four decision that should make the white house happy after a week where they found a real brock spack of everything theyve been trying to do in their policies does look like the final phase of that term is going to be one that will make the white house happy  dana you keep reading that spring in texas congressman who has been gracious enough to join us this morning were just getting this in 504 decision on a technicality you are looking at this too what are you hoping to see here congressman  i want to make sure we have policies in place that can treat the migrants with respect and dignity at the same time have repercussions we follow the laws because otherwise we are going to continue to have a record number of migrants coming into the united states and a lot of them are going to be released on our streets i want to replace the policies have to be in a central way that it doesnt  more people are coming to the united states  dana for your area your neighborhood your district the idea of remain in mexico policy is to try to have a process here not swamp the border patrol lets have them remain in mexico the biden administration tried twice to get rid of it did you ever advise them that was a bad decision  my position has been that in this case if you have a remain in mexico and they have access to an attorney they want to come and present their case and they are in a safe situation then we ought to do that otherwise you have so many people that come in come into the united states and a lot of them are given false hope because they do have a hundred people only 1012 are given asylum only 10 to 12 are going to be given asylum why are we letting 100 and we should be allowing only 10 or 12 of those people come into the united states  dana president biden has been away for five days at nato for a meeting theres been a lot of things happening back home there is the roe v wade decision it is the fact that inflation and gas prices continue crime across the border excuse me across the country and the really big issue the border is a major issue griff jenkins has been there for six days he counted 9000 people came across do you think biden will ever turn his attention to the border in a serious way before the midterm  yeah you know i feel bad for the  so many issues happening in the united states domestically and across the world dealing with russia and china i feel you know bad for him at the same time there were people that can implement the laws that we have on the books already to make sure that there is repercussions because otherwise and we finish this fiscal year which will be on september 30th we are going to have a record number of people coming into the united states and this is why certain policies like title 42 are important to keep in place while we look at the situation at the border there is no repercussions where people will return under title eight or title 42 they are going to keep coming into the united states and large large
g-_hVXzkn0o,is the tech bubble bursting right now,Tech,it is may 9th 2022 and youre watching the code report for the last 10 years people have been saying theres a bubble intact and finally it looks like that bubble is starting to pop or maybe its just a minor correction this is fine im okay with the events that are unfolding currently nobody really knows lets take a look at some of the bad news that has been piling up over the last few months and find out what it means for developers tech workers and startup founders in a video about a year ago i pointed out how companies like snowflake and shopify were absurdly overvalued as of today shopify is down over 75 percent and theyre not the only one virtually every highflying tech stock that ipod over the last five years is down anywhere from 50 to 90 percent the common theme around these companies is that they dont actually make any money they may have a lot of revenue growth but dont actually turn a profit and that means they need money to burn through to survive unfortunately the transitory inflation wasnt actually transitory and now the federal reserve has had to turn the easy money spigot off in addition many of these companies exploded during the pandemic and now growth is hitting a wall because pandemic mode has been turned off now if youre a bag holder for one of these companies that sucks but the thing thats a little more worrisome is that when companies lose money this rapidly they need to start cutting expenses and one of the best ways to do that is via layoffs screw you youre fired last week we saw highprofile companies like robin hood and work rise implement layoffs and meta aka facebook implemented a hiring freeze thats not a good sign for a company that wants to put us all on the metaverse now the big picture as of today still looks very strong but the dynamic seems to be rapidly changing it could stop right here but it could also get a lot worse and i think we should all be aware of that possibility now you might think the answer to this is bitcoin and crypto bitcoin has also crashed 50 in the last six months and like i predicted in my web 3 video this decline has gone hand in hand with a decline in hype for web 3 and nfts these may be amazing revolutionary technologies long term but its a lot harder to have fun when everybodys losing money now another group of people affected are the startup founders especially those who depend on venture capital many people have called out the whole vc system as a giant ponzi scheme made possible by easy money investor sentiment is way down valuations are going down and less capital is being deployed in all likelihood this means youll have a harder time securing funding in the near future and companies that have already been funded will likely need to cut costs and increase growth if they want to see additional funding in the future and zombie companies that have no path to profitability will probably not survive very much longer the days of companies like fast which had 60 million or no 60 thousand dollars in annual recurring revenue and 500 employees are over fast didnt become profitable fast enough and was discontinued in april the last time things looked this bad was early 2020 but that time the central banks were able to print trillions upon trillions of dollars the rich got way richer and we got the leftover crumbs in the form of stimis which were now paying for many times over in the form of inflation now i realize this video sounds very pessimistic but just remember that things could always get a lot worse like they could start world war three at any moment and draft us all onto the front lines until that happens though i will continue to learn to code and try to create value for other people because often the best opportunities emerge out of downturns like this this has been the code report thanks for watching and i will see you in the next one
hQtb20i40lU,gran turismo 7 vs  gran turismo sport  direct comparison,Sport,welcome back everybody to another episode of direct comparison in todays episode were going to take a look at the newly released gran turismo 7 and see what exactly it does differently both technically and from a gameplay perspective to the previous entry to the series gran turismo sport for this analysis both games are being played on the playstation 5 outputting on a 4k display with the visual settings set to their quality presets whenever possible though i do feel its important to note that these settings largely impact the quality of the replay videos and photo mode options so while i will show closeups of the vehicles and track elements using these modes ill also be sure to show actual gameplay sequences throughout to help give you a better sense of what the game will look like across the board alright so lets kick this comparison off by first taking a look at some car models starting with the ferrari 458 italia just like with gran turismo sport the vehicle models in gran turismo 7 are nothing short of remarkable there is an insane attention to detail to every available vehicle with an exceptionally high poly count and a near flawless color accuracy for each factory paint job ferrari reds for example appear the exact right tone of red that youd expect from the real thing and this is brought out even more so with an appropriate hdr display then theres all these small details like the ferrari insignia the headlamps and tail lights the wheel hubs and the beautifully decorated interiors that are not just retained but enhanced further thanks to a native 4k output as opposed to the checkerboarded 1800p used before with this big bump to the resolution you can expect a much cleaner sharper presentation overall greatly reducing the poor aliasing along its vehicles an issue that played gt sport gt7 also benefits from much more realistic reflective surfaces for its vehicles as well with higher resolution cube maps to use for the ingame models and more sophisticated ray tracing techniques in any of the games available photo or replay modes next lets take a look at the environments one of the weaker visual elements of gt sports presentation was without a doubt its environmental design iconic courses like brands hatch and mount panorama while faithful to their reallife counterparts as far as the track goes lacked at the level of detail necessary to make these locations feel believable the texture maps for necessities like the tarmac road stripes dirt and grass were all low res by todays standards and quickly fall apart under close scrutiny while the trees closest to the edge of the track were acceptable thanks to a smart use of multiple sprites per branch the layer of 2d trees in the backdrop is easy to spot due to the lack of proper shadowing gran turismo 7 doesnt necessarily improve everything across the board here all preexisting tracks built to be used in gt sport have most definitely been recycled back into gran turismo 7 and you can tell a lot of the same assets have been recycled as well but there have been a number of nice improvements all throughout that help transform these environments into something more tangible almost all of the textures for example have been updated with higher res variants most notably this dirt texture used on the opposite side of this track barrier vegetation has also been beefed up considerably with more 3d tree models being used to fill in the backdrops and appropriate shadowing being applied at further distances to create the illusion of a dense tree line theres even new grass sprites added to all the grass terrain on each track which helps a great deal in giving gran turismos world a more fleshed out appearance this has helped even more by gt7s largely increased draw distances which really get a chance to shine in some of the more original gt tracks with vast distant valleys offering some of the most scenic locations to drive alongside pedestrians have similarly been given a bit of an update with a bunch of new animated sprites being added to the crowd to bulk up the character diversity along with a few new 3d model characters that while not necessarily amazing look to be a step up from what we had before collectively gran turismo 7s tracks are a solid step in the right direction and offer improvements in the areas that needed the most though its understandably still not mindblowing either with even some of the most nicely decorated courses feeling like theyre a couple years behind thankfully the lighting does do a nice enough job distracting from these shortcomings with some gorgeous true to life color tones and dynamic time of day options available for practically every track its almost identical to the lighting rig used in gt sport but the improved reflections i mentioned earlier do make a drastic difference for the cars themselves whether in game or when watching higher quality replays the reflective cube and sphere maps have all been enhanced as you can see here displaying higher quality replications of the surrounding environment in replays these reflections are mostly replaced with ray trace reflections instead which can accurately project images of offscreen elements like other cars trees and even environmental decor its a very demanding effect and so whenever this ray tracing is active the game drops its frame rate to a locked 30 fps instead though players do have the option to swap to a performance mode effectively disabling ray tracing altogether however i did find that environmental reflections in game do feel like a slight step back as these roads even with the heaviest rain options and water accumulation on the road surface itself seems to make more use of specular lighting effects rather than the screen space reflections though my guess is that this is a result of pooled water now having an actual direct impact on the gameplay in gt7 which ill discuss more in a bit as for the actual ambient lighting something about gt7 still feels weirdly off volumetric lighting feels noticeably absent regardless of the time of day or weather conditions and bloom effects for some odd reason feel overly exaggerated in gt7 making rows of cars or reflective material alongside the track blindingly bright at certain angles something that didnt occur nearly as often if at all in gt sport next we have shadows despite using the exact same time of day settings in these races i found that often the shadows in gt7 are much sharper than those found in gt sport vehicle shadows are now razor sharp with every silhouetted detail being displayed on the pavement whereas in gt sport there was a great deal of softening added to these edges often accompanied by some fairly apparent shimmer and artifacting environmental shadows of objects further from the shadows projection also appear sharper like this tree here where tree leaves are almost being projected perfectly on the roads surface whereas in gt sport they appeared much softer and were arguably more realistic before but like with the car shadows these tree shadows in gt sport were often plagued with a lot of artifacting as different quality versions would pop in and out of existence as the player drove by a problem that does not seem to plague gt7 nearly as much with only a few major exceptions night shadows cast by the players car and dark races have also been redone casting large dark shadows dynamically depending on the players headlight direction and the object blocking them its at times a nice looking effect but some of that same unnatural dithering still occurs mixed with the fact that the shadow seems to completely negate the ais own headlights so theres definitely plenty of room for improvement moving on we have effects unfortunately gran turismo 7 still does not offer the sort of realistic damage models i would have hoped for but its important to note that this is more than likely a licensing issue with using these reallife vehicle brands rather than a failure on the developers part vehicles can still be damaged but the cosmetic appearance of even the most severe crash is easy to miss with only tiny fender dents and cracked headlights whats odd though is that the great looking particles that kick up from driving over loose gravel and sand has been greatly reduced this time around with only stationary particle effects appearing in the vehicles wake rather than kicking up like before its a weird drop in quality though my guess is that this might just be a bug as other particlebased effects like rain have seen a major improvement not only is heavy torrential rainfall represented with significantly more particles on screen in gran turismo 7 but the water itself will now pool realistically along the surface of the road and will relentlessly cause cars to hydroplane and largely impede vehicle control rain wasnt even technically featured in gt sport when it first released and was added later with a title update so its great to see gt7 come out of the gate with this feature not only available from the getgo but enhanced a great deal mix that together with the improved reflections and specular lighting and rainy nighttime races like this one really pop out on the screen to deliver something impressive adding to this is gran turismo 7s excellent use of the dual senses adaptive triggers which feels much better than the standard rumble effects used in gran turismo sport every type of road surface will feel different with rumble strips bridge junctions and every small impact with other cars being appropriately reflected in either trigger depending on which side of the car is affected ive played quite a few ps5 games now many that make liberal use of these triggers with mixed results but gt7s incorporation is probably one of the best so far and is one of the better new features on offer with this game another benefit gt7 sees thanks to the new hardware is the exceptionally sped up loading times that can last between only two or four seconds as opposed to the 10 to 20 seconds we saw with gt sport its a hugely welcome change especially considering how often gran turismo requires players to put between menu pages though i do wish that polyphony had found ways to streamline the menus a bit more and let players swap cars or open roulette rewards from the user menu bar at the top rather than requiring additional loading time just to visit the proper menu page another important distinction with gt7 over its predecessor is its available game modes and menus gt sport was a weird game when released back in 2017 it never really felt like a main line entry to the series which is evident by its naming convention and seemed to lean more heavily towards supporting its online competitive atmosphere as opposed to its traditional single player campaign the game did eventually get a rudimentary campaign with a long list of races to cross off a checklist but it still never quite felt right gt7 however is the full package with all the great multiplayer elements that fans loved about gt sport along with a complete racing career mode right out of the box the career involves collecting cars using easy to follow menu books given to the player at the central cafe hub with these menus players must then participate in races around the world each featuring different car manufacturers and brands all while earning necessary licenses competing in championships and carefully tuning vehicles with a robust vehicle modification menu the main world map screen is somewhat convoluted as most granchismo games have a tendency to be but thanks to a decent pace and an unmistakable passion for automotive history the game is just a joy to play through it never feels quite as monotonous as padding through gt sports available single player offerings my only complaint with the layout is that the arcade mode is weirdly integrated into the career mode menus so trying to set up a quick race with any owned vehicle requires that you visit a location submenu and then select the optional race options at the bottom gran turismo sports menus were simply more intuitive here with the modes listed clearly right at the top via drop down menus if gt7 could integrate something similar while retaining its semiimmersive campaign world map then i think we could have the best of both worlds for players interested in the cars themselves gran turismo 7 also sees a big increase to its starting lineup with over 424 cars available at launch as opposed to the 168 cars in gt sport however that number is a bit misleading as a lot of gt7s cars are unique racing variants of preexisting cars in the lineup and gran turismo sport did eventually up the total car list to 324 through updates gt7 also offers way more tracks for players to race these cars on at launch gt7 offers 34 different tracks to race across with 97 different layouts between them all gran turismo sport by comparison only offered 29 tracks at first and only ever managed to get to 82 total configurations by the end finally lets wrap up with a brief sound comparison which game do you feel offers the superior audio quality and design music applause music so music applause music applause music applause music applause music applause wow applause music applause music applause music applause music music applause music applause music applause so music music music music music music and that wraps up this episode of direct comparison overall gran turismo 7 is the gt game that i personally have been waiting years for it takes everything that worked in gt sport and improves upon it with a sizeable bump to its visual quality while also reintroducing gameplay elements that fans have been asking for theres still room for improvement as the game still has a rather stale appearance in many instances but i genuinely found myself having a lot of fun playing through this games career mode and im looking forward to seeing how this game progresses in the future but what do you guys think are you impressed with gran turismo 7 or do you still prefer the look and feel of gran turismo sport instead let me know in the comment section and dont forget to like and subscribe for more

DcFj6guz3v0,modern apartment tech upgrade tour 2021,Tech,what is going on everyone its justin here and welcome to a brand new home tech tour for 2021 so this is one of your favorite videos from last year where i showed you all the tech products that im currently using around the house and youve been following the channel for a while youve seen the changes that ive made both in the renovation of the kitchen and the floors changing up the bedrooms and decorating that as well as the office updates for 2020 but overall there are quite a few exciting pieces that ive added over the past year so today were gonna cover all of that just to summarize ive redone the entire office into an ultimate large lshaped desk as well as a projector setup and it looks completely different than it did last year ive also added a new speaker in the living room also the ps5 of course that came out in the past year the other thing is ive also actually moved my operations of video editing and filming over to a dedicated office space im sure you guys have seen that series if you follow the channel that is completely done so it is finally my home whereas before it was just like full of all the tech stuff that reviewed and the products would pile up in the living room the hallway the bedroom and just all over the place so now i at least have a bit of worklife separation but i do still spend a ton of time in the office for video editing in the evening and on weekends if you guys like to win one item from this video just make sure you follow me over on instagram at justintsc subscribe to the channel drop a like on this video and leave a comment down below of your favorite item as well as your instagram username and ill be picking a winner when this video hits 5000 likes as always all the products im gonna be talking about are gonna be linked down below as well so beginning on this side of the living room theres actually a few different pieces and this right here is the sonos arc this is their brand new speaker that came out last year and its like a new version of their play bar thats been around for many years its still really good i use it in my home office actually but what i picked up for the bedroom and also the living room is the brand new speaker and it actually has 11 classy amplifiers so just on the number side of things its great but it also has dolby atmos support 3d sound and just all the latest technologies as well as smart home capability i know some people mentioned that i shouldnt have it behind me but in this case the living room is kind of in a layout where i feel like putting it behind can make sense i just wanted to make use of the room back here the way it connects to your tv is actually through arc so it is called the audio return channel some of the newer tvs have a specific audio return channel but if it doesnt then you can also use the optical adapter that they include so yeah you have a lot of options and in terms of sound quality alone this sounds impressive so over to the media side of the living room this tv right here is the samsung qled and the reason why ive gone with oled in the office and qled in the home is simply because it is a really bright space and the sun is actually on that side for most of the day so i needed a tv that was as bright as possible but the oled honestly does look really really good as well so i think it does come down to the purpose and what i really like about samsungs tvs is that they have that one connect system so with one fiber optic cable it is actually able to go straight through the wall and if you dont want to cut any holes it is pretty invisible but in my case the holes were already precut so everything still goes through there and all of the i o is plugged into this grove concepts dresser right here so now were over in the media cabinet of the living room and this is where a lot of the tech lives both like inside and over here you have the sonos 3 which is a good home speaker and im able to play music on both this and the sound bar at the same time this is also team played and i also have the ps5 controller charging station and of course the orbi wifi 6 mesh system and the satellite part of the mesh setup the main setup is over in the office and it has a direct line ethernet to the computer which is why the mesh system is over here because usually when im in the living room i just im on my phone and stuff its good to have good connectivity but the maximum speed priority should be over in the office where all the works being done so i actually have a big hole cut in the back of this thing and there is the one connect system for the tv theres also the power bar and also the philips hue bridge and sonos bridge which is all in here and it essentially powers the entire home tech setup to allow me to fast and reliably connect and control everything from my phone in terms of gaming console i currently use a ps5 and because i was a ps4 user just based on personal preference it was natural to go over to ps5 so yeah this is pretty much the media cabinet part of the living room and for now everything is able to fit inside nicely but i may actually do like some custom mill work or shelving sometime next year im not really sure yet so the last item in the living room is one that kind of hides underneath the console table and it really isnt needed but i dont regret getting it it was on a black friday pricing and it is actually a scent diffuser so one of my favorite hotels that ive ever stayed at is the addition hotel in miami we stayed there during nascar about a year and a half ago and what i really noticed is that from the lobby to the rooms there was just like a very distinct smell to it and i noticed on their website they actually sold the diffuser with the scent of the hotel and it runs for about 300 hours so a few months give or take maybe even longer and you have all the customized settings on the back depending on just how intense you want the smell to be i have it set relatively subtle so it comes on a few hours a day everyone whos come by has kind of noticed that it smells really good so i do plan to get one for my retail store and also for my office sometime soon so perhaps one of the biggest updates that ive made to my entire home tech setup for 2021 is in the wifi system and this right here is the orbi wifi six ax 6000 mesh system from netgear when it comes to wifi six some of the devices that are currently supported that i own is the iphone 12 pro max some of the newest android phones and also the m1 macbook air and with wifi six youre not only able to have a larger throughput of up to 96 gigabits per second compared to 35 and is also much more efficient in managing the traffic when you have many of them connected to the same wifi network this router though is extremely powerful and not only does it have a large satellite and is able to cover up to 5 000 square foot with the set but it is actually able to reach speeds of up to six gigabits per second where i live the fastest speed available is gigabit internet and i can tell you that even through wifi on my iphone 12 and mabel well get impressive speeds through the wireless connection so the way that i have my orbeez system set up right now is that i have the main router in my home office and i also have an ethernet cord that is connected directly to the computer for the maximum speed and in terms of the wifi connectivity for the most part i am using my phone in my office so that is why the main router is right here theres four ethernet ports on the back which is super handy and i have the satellite one placed on the other side of the house where the living room and all the windows are and from there it is able to repeat the signal and give me a strong connection and from the wifi speed test im still able to maintain a really impressive speed off the satellite it also has four ethernet ports so i have my home tech connected to that such as the philips hue the sonos bridge and also the ps5 just to give it a very reliable signal even from the satellite so overall this system has been perfect for my setup and in a larger house that is significantly larger than the condo that i live in it is still going to be able to perform very very well this was all super easy to set up and you can also go to the orbi app and customize anything that you would want and also check the status and health of your wifi network at any time so if you guys want to go ahead and check it out for yourself ive also got a discount for you guys im gonna leave a link to everything down below so in the dining table area one of the only changes that ive made in the past year or so is in the dining room light before i had one that was like a gold led wayfarer one and it looked pretty decent but it had like a weird color temperature that didnt really match the rest of the place so i ended up selling it on facebook saw this one on sale and i think it has a really cool look to it im sure its not the kind of design that everyone would like but its 4000 kelvin it has tons of bulbs and it also just kind of stays out of the way a little bit more as opposed to the long rods that i had before one of the biggest things that im really trying to work on after moving my work out of my house is to keep it clean and well maintained because before thered just be so many videos to work on and i would say that id probably clean it after that wave of videos was done but year after year it was just always so messy but the tool that i have to keep this place clean is the dyson v11 outsized vacuum which is their newest flagship model at the moment the outsize model has a 150 bigger bit than the standard v11 model and just basically using the dyson lineup since the v8 and the v10 and now the v11 and v11 outsize i can tell you that this is one of the best accessories that actually makes cleaning a little bit fun it also has a run time of about 120 minutes which is quite a bit more than what you get on the standard model so you dont have to recharge it right away and the kit also comes with a spare battery which is super nice so yeah usually i try to at least vacuum the place a couple times a week and yeah just because we are talking about vacuums though this is definitely not a tech product by any means but because i watched tick tock all day i thought id share like one of the few things that ive learned from it and that is this tool right here so this rug that i have is from west elm and i have it here and also in the office because im boring and just bought the same rug twice the one thing though is that these rugs shed like crazy it makes a huge mess all over the place it pills it like leaves like these lint balls which is super annoying so this tool right here is one on amazon that is like under ten dollars it is just like a i dont know like a set of coils but i just like go ahead and scrape the rug and it will bring all of the lint into a nice little pile for you to vacuum up and for the next like week or two youll notice that the rug just like causes much less mess so i think its a really good maintenance tool and i thought i would just share that as well music so now that were in the kitchen ive got to be totally honest with you guys and its the fact that i dont really cook at all um i actually tried for a little bit last year when everything was closed down and i didnt really have as much work to do but its just something that im not good at and if i spend hours making a meal or like buying all these supplies i end up messing it up and it just makes the meal not that worth it so ive chosen to spend that time on work itself and instead getting the food figured out whether its skip the dishes or just going to my parents house for dinner each night this right here is a dishwasher it is the samsung one from the chef collection and after it is done washing it actually opens by itself by about five inches so i throw the dishes in there i forget about it once its done it will let all the steam out for it to dry a little bit better and i thought that was just like a cool feature to have in a dishwasher but i dont know like for any other guy out there whos living by themselves i just find like cooking for one person to be very difficult and when you break down the cost per meal after having to buy all the bits and pieces and tools that arent in the kitchen already it ends up just costing more than doing something like a meal plan so some of my favorite accessories that i have in the kitchen are actually on the coffee side of things and i know theres a lot of options out there and sometimes you just want like a simple coffee maker that is probably lower in price but there are also some higher end accessories that can really make the experience fun each morning for your routine so these are products that i actually really enjoy and ive had this kettle for quite a while and this grinder just showed up but yeah this kettle is super easy to use it not only looks great it is the stag ekg and a lot of my friends had it which is when i saw it and decided to get one for myself and you actually just go ahead and plug it in theres a dial right here that allows you to set the temperature down to the specifics and theres also a hold button on the back that retains the temperature for a period of time so whenever youre doing pour over coffee this makes things very easy um and for a kettle it not only has like this nice classic look to it and the matte black that goes very well with this space in the office but it also has the tech side of things to go with that and the newest product in their lineup is the fellow old grinder and i actually saw their kickstarter video about a year ago and it was just had my eye on it and i just thought it was so cool it just looks very different its super well built and fully out of metal but most importantly it is a really good coffee grinder because you have all the specific settings that have 64 settings in total and it lets you know like kind of the range of what you would like to set the grind size to so yeah you just put your coffee through the top you set your weight and you can set your grind settings press the button in the front and just empty out the extra pieces in there but overall it is just a very precise and highend coffee grinder if you make coffee every day then this is definitely something that you should check out if you guys have any like bean suggestions make sure you let me know but im definitely someone who has to drink coffee every single day and i feel like checking out some of the tech accessories like this that not only look really really cool in the kitchen just makes it a lot more fun um this is not sponsored at all i just really like these products a lot so now that were in the hallway were going to take a look at the thermostat and this is the new one from nest and for the most part honestly i havent really noticed that big of a difference in terms of functionality but it does look a little bit different it has a bit more of a futuristic holographic look on the screen with a reflective finish and it also uses the google home app and doesnt work with the nest app anymore because google owns nest which is kind of unfortunate because i have quite a few other nest accessories so because i dont use the google home app very often i sort of have to jump in between them but i guess its no big deal but with a thermostat like this you can just schedule them it will try to optimize for cost savings in the power bill it also knows when youre home and away and can set schedules based on that it comes in four different colors but obviously because my walls are like the whitest white i went with the snow one and it just seems to blend in very nicely all the controls are actually on the side so it is no longer a touch screen or an active dial but to be totally honest with you if youre able to get the nest thermostat e at a good price i think that one is actually a better option just because i like the intuitive feel of being able to rotate the dial completely instead of having to use a little touch panel on the side and i also feel like it attracts less fingerprints than this reflective one but from a design perspective being that futuristic look i think the new redesign does make a lot of sense for the new nest so here we are in the home office which probably saw the biggest change in the past year so if you guys remember the renovation of the whole place was in 2019 and one of the areas that it didnt make any changes to was the home office i was still really trying to decide how i was going to do it and how we were going to optimize the setup for both filming and working and one of the first things that i decided to do after purchasing the new office space and knowing that we were going to move the operations over was to really optimize the home setup this is actually the master bedroom of the condo so i sleep in the guest room the first thing i want to do was to move the desk away from the wall i feel like if youre sitting at your desk for many hours a day staring at a big white wall that is like a couple feet away does start to feel a little bit strange so i decided to pull the desk back and after a lot of brainstorming i went with an lshaped desk that is also sitstand so this is actually a set of legs from uplift you just go ahead and press the button and it will go up and down it can hold a ton of weight and on top of it i have a desk that i had before from bow concept and we had used that as my main desk for quite a few years and i also added an ikea carl b countertop on the other side and just essentially built a custom desk out of it and just got the legs on their own in terms of what i have from a tech standpoint on my desk it is very much for video editing and production and for a lot of people its going to be overkill but because i make my entire living on a computer and online it does make a lot of sense i also have the thunderbolt hub right here which has the sd card slot all the thunderbolt the usbs the usb type c and also the ethernet and all the stuff can just plug right into that i can easily access it i have my card readers over here as well and in terms of speakers this is another area that i have made an upgrade in the past year or so and that is the kef lsx which ive seen to be very very popular so these speakers are actually wifi based and a lot of times people use them with record players and like hifi audio systems but some also choose to use it with their computer and what i can say is the computer setup is a little bit more complicated because if you use a 35 millimeter headphone jack and just plug it into your computer they arent actually going to sound that good and if you spent that kind of money on a pair of speakers you definitely want it to sound better so what ive actually added is a fio k3 and that is a digital audio converter that allows it to have more power and essentially unleashes the full potential of these speakers and the fio k3 is like a pretty inexpensive preamp if you guys want to get something more fancy theres a ton of options out there and the whole audio world has just so many choices but i found that by using that setup these speakers sound much better but the best sound youre gonna get is if you use it in the wifi mode and you can control all the settings from the app and also switch the input and everything from the remote that it also includes so one of my favorite additions this year is the benq tk850 projector and when i was trying to redesign this office i ended up putting everything together and then was trying to figure out what were really missing and with the amount of space that i have above the monitor and between the wall i decided that having either a tv or projector up there would be super cool because throughout the long editing sessions it would be nice to watch like hockey or something uh just to be able to have it on the background and i feel like in this type of setup the projector just seemed to make a lot of sense because when its off the wall doesnt have this big piece hanging up near the ceiling so yeah this right here is a 4k projector it is super bright which is handy for a room like this where there are large windows and everything so i do have blackout shades that i added midway through the year but i honestly havent really seen anybody do this same setup before but i would say if you guys are working late nights or if youre in a type of job that youre just like kind of always got something to do then adding a projector and just having it play in the background can make things a lot more fun and distract you from the fact that youre editing like multiple hours a week after working the day as well so on the other side of the desk setup in the office i have a few other pieces that are just sitting on top of a console table funny enough i bought this console table on wayfair ended up wrapping all of the shelves in 3m dinock because it had a gloss finish and turn it into matte black and then i took some of the remnants from my backsplash project over at the office and had them cut a piece that fits this table so essentially i bought it for the frame and every single other piece of this console table has been modified in some way shape or form when it comes to the tech side of things so there is a sono speaker this is the original play bar that i used to have in my living room and i have this connected over to the projector so im watching like hockey or formula one at five in the morning my neighbors get to hear the race car driving by uh this speaker overall just does a really good job and even though it is quite a few years old whether youre playing music or watching tv it is still an excellent option and i have also seen it on facebook quite a bit at significantly lower than its original price so if you dont want to make the jump over to the sonos arc and the beam might not be powerful enough then this is still a really solid choice so the other thing here is a light and this is a buster and punch one weve used a lot of their hardware their lighting and also even their whiskey cabinet and although this has nothing to do with tech what it does have to do attack is the light switch or a smart plug that i have connected to it so if you guys remember last year i did a video of a micro lock and in that video we showcased a set of four miro smart plugs and those come in at a price point of under 25 for a set of four and i can tell you ive never been happier with a piece of tech especially for smart home at that price point and how it works right here i have the application and all i have to do is just press the button it will turn the light on and off as you can see and it is a smart plug on the bottom if you want to manually turn it on and off you can also do that as well and you can also set different schedules and routines so for right here i have this turn on every day at 8 pm and i have it off at 12 30 am and over at the office we have the feature media light and we also have the whiskey cabinet and that is able to set to a schedule of 9 30 to 6 30 or wherever you want it to be and each day i dont have to manually turn on the light but ive tried a ton of home tech over the past couple years some of which work very well some of them are just really unreliable but for the price point in a set of four i really wasnt expecting that much but i can tell you this one has never had a single problem and especially when you have it on a widget in your home page it just makes things much easier and its essentially instantaneous from my experience so definitely recommend this for a budget option so now were in the bedroom and from the tech perspective nothing has really changed that much in this space the tv is one that i updated to a qlik model i believe it is a 2020 version and for the most part it still has the one connect system it has the whole like i o and all that separate from the tv itself as well as the power so all of that is down here um its kind of hard to keep out of the way but i have the 55 inch model it is the same size as the living room it has all the smart features and below that we have a sonos arc but it is in the white color so the reason why i want the white one here and a black one in the living room is because the black one is pretty much facing the sun and so it doesnt show any fading or anything um as much as the white one could over many years you guys have already seen this last year so im not gonna go into too much detail but it just looks super clean against the wall and just very seamless and i really only use this tv to watch formula one in the morning because its so early and a lot of times you want to watch the start of the race and the end of the race and just like go back to bed in between so i have it playing on this tv otherwise the rest of this room is exactly the same i have a sonos one the original model on both sides with the alarm clock that is set to that i also have them synced up so i could play some music in a stereo pattern and some of the changes that i might make this year to the bedroom is ill maybe add like some mill working or wainscoting to the wall because right now it is just a large white blank wall with nothing at all the whole room is white but to be honest i dont really care that much its a bedroom i sleep here like seven or eight hours a day and the rest of the time im either at the office or in the master bedroom editing videos and just at the desk i also have a couple phillips hue bulbs inside of a west elm lamp and one of the things i started using lately because i started waking up a bit earlier is the wake up function on the philips hue so its actually able to start uh turning on about 10 20 or 30 minutes prior to when you want to wake up and it just gradually brightens the room because otherwise it is pitch black after adding some blackout shades last year as well so yeah i feel like thats like a good function they also make like sleep lights that weve also shown on the channel so if youre looking for something thats a little bit cheaper then that is a solution for like 20 bucks but if you happen to have philips hue in the bedroom anyways then that is a feature that i found out about recently so now of course were in the bathroom and im going to talk about some of the essentials that i use on an everyday basis when it comes to the tech side of things and i try to keep my routine super simple i do my hair in like under a minute but because we are partnered with dyson we do have this fancy hairdryer the super sonic that has been around for many years i really like that they keep releasing limited edition colors because they look super cool theres like a gold and blue one a black one but this right here is a simple white one so some of you guys have been watching uh for quite a while and ive been asking how ive changed up my hair routine uh so the way i do it and the reason why my hair is not like as straight and weird looking from the side anymore is because i use uh curling cream just like throw some mom after i get out of the shower before i dry my hair and then i would go like this and keep it at the two setting and just get it so that the hair sticks up to the way i like it takes like maybe 1520 seconds and then i will go ahead and throw a diffuser on which i didnt really know what a diffuser was until like this year ive never used one before and i ended up just shaping it and molding the hair so that it has like a nice curl backwards and stands up the way i like so for the most part that is all done and then ill throw on this product that ive been using for quite a few years and that is blue lay right um just some matte cream just put a bit on around the hands and just run it through and it just holds everything in place but for the most part all the work is done by the hairdryer and more specifically the diffuser if you guys want to see like a more detailed morning routine make sure you let me know in the comments section below but some of the other pieces that i use is just like this babbling shaver my barber hadnt recommended it and it is a double foil shaver i replaced the the top and i couldnt find it in gold anymore but its no big deal but yeah this is just pretty easy to use it is rechargeable and its what i use to shave this off every day because i probably dont look very good with a beard um toothbrush it is one from bruce ive had this for many years now and super selfexplanatory i mean it just has like all these different modes here recharge it you can get new heads for it on a subscription basis but these are like the three products that i use in the bathroom when it comes to tech and otherwise i dont really use or think i need anything else so thank you guys so much for watching this years home tech tour where i show you guys some of the tech products that weve updated what im currently using in terms of gadgets in my own place i might do one for the office as well if you guys really enjoy it but overall this is like kind of been a progression over the past couple years i used to be someone who was really against home tech and i wasnt a huge fan of using it but with some fine tuning and trying out the right products we kind of figured it out and i think the system that we have at the moment when it comes to tech is one that i really enjoy the video editing and like the workflow side of things can always see some improvements but i hope you guys enjoyed this video i hope it gave you guys some ideas as well and as always all the products that i mentioned are going to be linked down below and ill see you all in the next one

VxoXfpr6spc,i tried to speedrun minecraft education edition,Education,as of recent i have been speedrunning minecraft java edition version 116 as a means of mastering a game ive been playing for almost a decade now i have found solace in speedrunning by being able to adapt to your environments and to test your game knowledge as the forefront in improving ones time by no means am i the best speedrunner of all time and have only pbd at 50 minutes in hopes of getting a sub 30 one day however the other day i was recommended a video that detailed the inner workings of minecraft education edition in which i thought to myself i wonder how speed running minecraft education edition would go and if thats even possible with that thought i downloaded minecraft education edition loaded up a world and set foot on a quest a quest in which i was not aware of what lied ahead so the second that the world started i did the exact same thing as always i mined a tree got stone tools and looted a village and upon reaching that village i began to notice some differences in the games mechanics opposed to java edition for starters the hoe didnt mind the hay bales at the now buff speeds and my axe crits never had to recharge nor crack the iron golem at this moment i realized that this was the old combat mechanics and that bedrock edition was the source for education edition with his new gain knowledge i set forth looking for a lava pool yet my mind was constantly trying to think of the differences that lied ahead of the run after what felt like forever in speed run terms i found a lava pool that just so happened to be the exact size and lava needed in order to create another portal and upon completion set my spawn point as a precautionary of course and entered the nether and another fortress at the same time the next step in completing this run is obviously to obtain blaze rods in order to create eyes of enders to locate the end portal as time went on my inability to locate a blaze spawner led me to believe that a blaze spawner didnt spawn in another fortress as a means of not letting kids who are at school obviously to beat minecraft when they should be paying attention to a coding lesson fortunately for myself when that thought entered my mind i instantly found a blaze spawner and couldnt have been more relieved that i was wrong yet my troubles only seemed to increase from here you see as i killed the last couple of blazes that i needed i realized what seemed so off from the beginning the hoe didnt seem to mind the hay bale accordingly because it was an older version of minecraft as that sadly sank in i looked around for gold on the ceilings in desperation and the walls of the nether and there was not a single piece of gold to be found 116 wasnt in this edition of minecraft my goto method of speedrunning didnt apply here as there were no means of getting pearls by trading gold with piglens i began to panic and think of a solution as i left another knowing there was nothing left for me there i decided to run in one direction in hopes of finding an enderman to kill in order to make a single eye of ender to at least know the direction i should be running towards the first enderman didnt drop a pearl but instantly afterwards my disappointment was relieved and i found another one and upon killing it it dropped a pearl i created a single eye of ender threw it and then watched it break into pieces soon after heading towards that direction i found a desert and remembered old speed runs involved creating boats sitting in a desert at night and killing endermen in order to obtain pearls i tried this method and had absolutely no luck which i now accredit to the strange occurrences of entities spawning in a chunk by chunk basis which is identical to bedrocks after a grueling walk through the desert i was in between a temple and a savannah village i then realized the method of speedrunning prior to 116 was through trading with villagers for emeralds with sticks these sticks were then traded with another villager that gave you pearls i then decided to rate the temple of its resources in hopes of getting better gear and its tnt as well as to sleep right before entering the village to avoid a villager dying to a zombie since i didnt know the process of trading for pearls i looked up a youtube video watched it as i had difficulties corralling villagers accidentally hitting them and the tiresome burden of changing their professions once i managed to start the trading process i realized this process was going to take a long time maybe i did it wrong or should have reset them constantly but i wasnt risking it after being 40 minutes into the run after another 20 minutes of repeating the cycle of trading sticks with villagers getting a pearl destroying their entire lifes work wondering why the stupid green villager wouldnt aid me in my quest i finally got the needed 12 ender pearls to finish my run however i wanted more ender pearls as a safety net and repeated the cycle once more once obtaining the 14 enter pearls they set off to the stronghold without freeing them and leaving their town in utter shambles unfortunately this was my biggest mistake i left in a rush and did not think of the ruination that lied ahead after walking no more than five minutes i found another village and saw the beauty of a village yet thwarted by a minecraft player i ran swiftly in fear that the villagers would notice and hear word of what happened to their neighboring vill and then i ran back because i passed the portal i mined straight down to finish what i had started but to my surprise i didnt find the stronghold even after it went down in that exact location i started to tower back up desperately to look around a cave system i had mine passed earlier once again nothing at this point i thought strongholds didnt exist at all but then i saw a piece of mossy stone brick sticking out and mined into the stronghold to look for the portal after a brief search i started to run in circles as there were no other paths to take i dug for walls potentially blocking them off but after several minutes it dawned on me there was no end portal having felt defeated i told myself no way after all this time all this effort this is how it ends in a rage i decided to go into creative mode and to blow up the stronghold to hopefully find a portal to prove my theory wrong yet i was right there was no portal at least one that was generated i decided to give myself the final piece in this run and to at least finish what i had started i returned to survival mode and to rest before the big fight i entered each of the eyes of ender into the newly constructed portal and witnessed the portal open in contemplating jumping perhaps this was all a mistake perhaps i had somehow awakened something that was best left to be dormant i spawned on a floating platform and made my way to the end island to see what challenge awaits me upon bridging i remember that the ender dragon perches differently in bedrock to the point that there was a different setup and usage of lava in order to one cycle it therefore i stared at the pillar wishing i had gotten a bow and arrow from the villagers i treated so poorly and thus began the fall music after pillaring up to the first crystal and destroying it i thought to use my ender pearl to get to the next couple of pillars in hopes of clearing the end faster however in this version of minecraft seemingly if you pearl to a crystal you instantly die whereas in java you normally skate away with minimal damage once getting back i bolted around my water bucket that i left behind turns out that the dragon get rid of your water source and destroy your items on the ground with this my only hope of getting to the pillars was by using blocks but without a pickaxe how is that possible well luckily the tnt had left behind a considerable amount of blocks and i grabbed everything from the explosion site to reach the remaining crystals however this dragon was immensely aggressive and even using a new move i have never seen in minecraft before it creates a vortex that does insane tick damage while levitating you up in the air this combined with his new strange patterns and new aggressive nature i kept trying again and again prying my way through the fight with the same strategy but losing my resources every attempt however the same tools constantly survived that being what i began to refer as my sword and my gold helmet which i began to symbolize as my crown due to seeing it as a motivation of sorts and growing more attached to it each time each time i ran out of blocks id return to the overworld more beaten up but a growing determination and grit i see whenever i face obstacles in front of my goals mining gravel with my bare hands mining old blocks to further my climbs time and time again until finally all the crystals were gone i threw the last of my items on the ground in order to retrieve them postmortem now it was just me and the dragon with my crown a bed 14 flint three blocks of dirt six torches and my iron sword i knew this was it i fought tirelessly for something i caused once i began to see his health go down a sigh of relief started to overwhelm me however my health bars seemed to do the same thing but much faster then again i was left shocked to my core the ender dragons health replenishes upon you exiting the dimension even if all the crystals are destroyed the dragon had finally destroyed my crown the object i had clung onto during this process after having no luck i felt defeated yet i knew it wasnt over i wanted to finish what i started reminded of the beauty of the village i had stumbled across i started from square one mine a tree get stone tools and loot a village afterwards i knew that wasnt all i needed this had to be done finished and i had to be prepared this time i mined the resources of the nearby cave for iron tools and armor but kept in my mind the crown i held so dearly that i wish to forge a new one in knowing that this run was soon to be finished and i could finally come out victorious taking one last glimpse as i did the first time jumped into what i now learned the dragon constantly perched time and time again my nerves increasing as i waited to deal the final blow in hopes of the dragon not landing hers and then all of a sudden it was over music and with that the credits rolled at two hours in 16 minutes however there was one last thing that had to be done i wish to thank the villagers that aided me in this quest i returned to the end to claim my trophy went back to the overworld and to return to surface as a victor to the villagers that saw me in shambles i returned all the beds that i had taken protected them from the hust that loomed over them and placed the enderdragon egg on their highest tower and that was the story behind the time i tried to speedrun minecraft education edition music you
QX_AX5wkbpQ,he left nigeria to build a million dollar tech company in south africa,Tech,from my own personal experience nigerians also shine when they have to prove their value you naturally come more prepared than others so when i look at some of the deals i chase in this country when im building my pitch im already feeling like cola youre already at a back foot here so you go hard or you go music whats up guys how you doing today is taiyo i know here again and today i have a special guest in the house im here beside mr cola olajide who is the founder of bridge labs which is a technology company and its located in south africa how did you get started whats your story cool i moved south africa in 2009 yeah i came here to study you know after my studies i started working in corporate you know but id always been passionate about education technology in the early days it wasnt easy to get the entrepreneurship visa right what we had back then was the exceptional skills visa and i really wanted an exceptional skills visa i landed an opportunity to do a project for western cape government i think they had a project then that wasnt successful and i was brought in to to work on this project and right after that the director wrote a letter to the government which accelerated the decision on my exceptional skills visa and since then i havent looked back right ive just been an entrepreneur im on my third company now first one didnt do so well so we had to sell the intellectual property to a major university was it a community company right tech right so actually this is my first company thats not edtech right so unfortunately tech certainly was also a tech sold intellectual property to um an organization in mauritius with the funds from the exit started bridge labs five years ago how many years ago did you come down to ive been here for 13 years 2009 january 13 years what has the journey been like it hasnt been easy um id put so much pressure on myself growth is always going to be uncomfortable right so i try to make sure that im not comfortable yes you might see somebody to remain more comfortable as much as i can especially when it comes to building businesses one of one of the things i think has worked well for me is um doing hard things very early when i started bridge labs we look at the kind of clients we work with you know they are some of the biggest players in south africa so we have to find ways to get into the door right everyone was coming with their own standard business model and we had to find innovative ways right i met my first client at bridge labs while i was giving a guest lecture at a business school and gibbs ive got instead of being science so its been an interesting journey from talent identification to even business development and i think what has also helped is the reputation and the work had done on the past so thats also helped making bridge labs what it is today i know you guys want to learn about business but before i get into todays video id love to give a shout out to the sponsor of this video which is also one of the best business purchase decisions i have ever made soft chart vpn and what is a vpn a vpn offers you a secure connection between you and the internet whenever im traveling im always using a lot of public wifi you know at the airport at coffee shops and these public wifi are not safe because theres not much security on them so you can easily get hacked or your credit card information can easily get stolen at the click of a button soft shark vpn prevents all of that it keeps you safe and it allows you to browse the internet securely another great reason for a vpn is that you can change your location to anywhere in the world im sure there are many times youre trying to access a new show and you might not have it available in your country soft shark vpn helps with that it gives me access to websites where i can buy cheaper flights many of these websites are not available in my country but with soft shack i can get access to them softshack is also one of the few vpn companies that allows you to use the service across unlimited devices so if youre using your phone or using a laptop you can use multiple devices all together at the same time to get soft vpn click on the link in the description and use the code cayo to get 83 off at three months for free so now lets jump right back into the video so lets backtrack to nigeria when you were in nigeria what was your childhood like and also like what kind of family are you from some from family of six um dad and mom still alive i remember we were born and i was in bagada at that point um it was an interesting phase and yeah ive also gotten a couple of opportunities to go back to nigeria and do something which im not exploring i mean good thing i got a couple of friends doing really amazing stuff my ninja you know you know i can go back and it can actually feel like oh its not the way i left left right so i look forward to explore building something in the country nice so you mentioned three companies you said the first one didnt work out you know a lot of people when something doesnt work i just give up how are you able to continue and build something else even after that didnt work out it was a very interesting comment i was very young at the point and we were five cofounders from five different african countries we had the the best resume to build a startup at the point big thing when you build a company is trust and one of the mistakes we also made at the beginning is we just share the company equally among each other what happens is when some people start to contribute more than the others he doesnt feel fair you dont feel like getting the value before you bring it to the table different things happen right and i guess you know we all made mistakes and were really young and we didnt have mentors at the point who are going to guide us through also we won um a lot of awards people who get caught up in the awards game and you know to keep them away from the focus of their business and thats why these days im very focused on the business not the awards no people like get caught up in these awards and all the states right so yeah i think also with the product were building then the market wasnt ready the goal of the business was helping universities take their courses online basically taking education out of the four walls of the classroom and yeah we did review some interesting software that got acquired by a major university in south africa and also because we had all these awards people landed a lot of opportunities and the cofounding team so someone one of them went to work for a major airplane company companies to build airplanes and now i went to google and um but it was a foundation that played a role a major role in who the fiberboards are today they mentioned bridge labs thats your main company now yes whats bridge labs what would you call it bridge labs was started to help forwardthinking organizations build products that are customercentric and by the time i started bridge labs ive taken some of the lessons from building the first business to now the second business and also the second business one thing i did differently was i was an entrepreneur in residence at an organization right i think thats where a lot of entrepreneurs they are getting drunk you cant disrupt something you dont understand so how do we innovate from the inside right so thats our bridge lab started our first client was um one of south africas largest privately owned car dealerships um you know they were doing you know close to 60 70 million dollars in revenue annually oh wow right and we were brought in to basically build an operating system for them to help them manage their processes and also cut down on fraud because everything is going digital right so now because of the strength of the client we got to collaborate with the major banks in the country and even with the major credit unions i think that project put us on the map we were able to then partner with universities to identify talent and getting clients from then were just organic right because people saw what we did for them and a lot of people wanted us to work with them then things evolved as i started to shape the vision of the company i started to see and the skill set we had built was also needed by startups so now if you look at our array of clients today its a combination of you know established companies with couple billion in in revenue annually to fastgrowing startups that have just raised you know something significant to take them to the next level but what are some of the major challenges you faced when building these businesses at the beginning of my entrepreneurship career credibility was an issue right because it would be like okay whos this young man coming to this environment and wanting all this big deal so if we look at the average service provider pitching for these deals they come across as much older and more experienced and so who are this really confident young crowd that is trying to come in and you know to to the biggest table very early like i would were you then i was 22 22 yeah so yeah they liked what you do but they just felt like youre too young for them to put so much of their future in your hands yeah yeah so they may have low yeah so that was the you know the earlier problems we faced but the problems we face as entrepreneurs has evolved now from coming up with innovative ways to keep our top talent making sure the the clients we are working with are the right bets i mean one of the things we do at bridge labs also is we discount our services so that we can partake in the upside we create for your organization and i think that deal structure is what has gotten us you know into a couple of organizations everyone comes with a fixed fee for a thick set of resources we come in with an entrepreneurial mindset with a clear goal of creating value for you and sharing the upside make you feel like if you know the project fails we also have a lot to lose coming down to south africa what was the deciding factor where most people think about going in uk canada and the rest what made you choose south africa so at the point um i i had an uncle who you know was very successful in the family at some point it was actually on the presidential committee settled by obasanjo back in the day oh okay you know she was forcing the family to go to mit that kind of wow and he was like okay you know its really important you know the kids go to good schools outside nigeria right so fosters was canada and then i remember applying to you know to the schools in canada and they said we couldnt prove we had the financial muscle to sustain um ourselves in such environments so the next option were south africa the south africa for me was like a i was like a stepping stone into canada canada okay right so i thought i would come here you know spend the year or two and then you know moving to going to canada right um and unfortunately he passed away right he passed away um you know and for me i was like okay you know spoke to my parents and i was like i was gonna make the best of you know of the opportunity of south africa right so um i think for me i stayed and you know studied hard did what we had to do and i think what also helped is the field i was in right tech was just getting off the ground so i mean if you were a great engineer companies would really want you to stay that helped with my decision to stay in in south africa also at the point of all um tech ecosystems in africa essay was the most vibrant right now you know you can see theres a shift we got kenya coming up nigeria but yes it was the most vibrant at the point thats what led to the decision to stay here so stayed there studied here um you know and just never looked back what kind of family social also a middle income you know family okay right um you know and my mom was very very entrepreneur oh okay right i would say even when when the power cuts became really um problematic in nigeria my mom set up a generator business actually oh okay market oh wow i dont even know i did market yeah yeah so my mom had you know big generator and that was powering the the whole market and you know getting shops to pay out so im always very entrepreneurial yeah i think thats what also kept me grounded what would you say is the highlight of your career so i think first major highlight in my career was the project with the with the government okay and i think they had just spent a couple million on it before it before they considered it as a failed project someone convinced them to give me a chance and i was able to do everything from the software engineering to the project management to the client interaction but i think that was the first highlighting like i remember coming home and im like hold on you just if youve done this its going to be difficult for you to go work for someone somebody else right because youve seen the potential you know you have and also if you ever fail there will be a lot of companies that are willing to catch you because of the experience so just jump music so whats the name of this location we are yeah its very secure the presidents just down the road oh wow like the person yeah yeah its like five five minutes away from here oh wow um so if youre driving into the office youd see a lot of security on the street on the streets so we would say this is also like a very prime area yeah very private you have residential and you have your commercial office its a very green environment yeah it is actually and i think its also good to if youre trying to attract talent the best quality because everybody wants to work in the best place thats where the magic happens yeah thanks for for coming um i mean with with the pandemic and essaying the current fifth wave most of the people are working remotely for us theres some people around so feel free to to connect with the team were gonna be meeting in park oh okay i didnt named after yeah the name thats african cities oh okay wheres lagos when he goes lets go to lagos and lagos is the biggest boardroom oh this is legos yes this is much bigger space so what happens yeah this is like where you have your meetings yeah so everyone is around we all sit down here and have a meeting nice so now were going into johannesburg perfect yeah so what are three notable projects youve worked on so far great i mean i can give you three that excites me correctly one is the continuous digital transformation for one of our largest clients today top avicas largest privately owned car dealership we opened there with a lot of automation and they do close to a billion around the revenue here thats project assessment because they were a founding client right one side of the company another one thats exciting is the new bank right so theres a new bank siding in south africa nigeria and kenya and weve been brought on board to help them shape and build their you know their first product and so thats you know throw me into some more comfortable territory because im not like a guy you like you like you like exactly im so excited you know about that project going well actually they should be launching a couple of months i think the other one is a fam tech platform think of it as a onestop shop for women when it comes to everything healthcare and we built out their mvp and excited to see where they take the product right so yeah um and lets adjust the three notable ones at every given time we should have you know eight to ten projects going on but these three are the ones that you know exciting me the most right now sounds like a lot of responsibility yeah so yeah music perhaps how old are you im 30 youre 30 yeah wow how does it feel to have been able to build or do all these things at such a young age because 30 is like its young it feels great i mean the accolades you know helped right the first time i was on forbes magazine you know its not really you know great and im so glad my first venture didnt get on forbes though because i dont think i was mentally ready right if i was unfortunate my first venture i would have gotten caught up in the noise and the business wouldnt have activated is through the values i think what ive been very successful at is helping other people solve their own problems i think with all the lessons ive learned in the last 10 years its time to build my own legacy as an entrepreneur im going to build a business um you know on the african continent um to solve one problem for millions of people so the question i think for me its yeah i think its its exciting and i definitely find time to smell the roses but its very important to remain uncomfortable youve said that youve said that in multiple thousands i think ive ive picked that from you we may not comfort them seek discomfort so um talking about africa you mentioned africa now why africa for you the continent has potential we are getting the global recognition we deserve right its becoming clear that african talent can compete on a global scale i mean we get a couple of unicorns now on the continent people can see the value that can be created by talented people you know so yeah for me it was also strategic because you know when i did done the project in mauritius because other people i went i worked with went on to do great things at different organizations across the globe now when they need great solutions usually they come they come to the guy they met in that environment who built a great solution and they can always vouch for awesome awesome so now lets talk about being nigerian throughout your time in south africa have you had any challenges being a nigerian so id say ive faced challenges being a nigerian across the world okay right ive traveled and faced challenges um you know when youre at the airport for more hours than usual you should be happy um so thats become standard i think the main thing for me is the south african country has contributed heavily to who i am today right and i should be proof that you know they are successful nigerians paying their taxes and also giving back to society right and i hope when whoever is watching this would be able to say okay people like color actually live in in johannesburg what you say has been the most positive part about being nigeria so yeah the nigerian spirit is real it gives me drive and also i salute entrepreneurs in nigeria doing the arts yeah im here doing the athens but theyre doing harder things right um so definitely the nigerian spirit has also you know contributed from my own personal experience nigerians also shine when they have to prove their value because then you naturally come more prepared than others right so when i look at some of the deals i chase in this country when im building my pitch im already feeling like youre already at the back foot here so you go hard or you go right you have to build the most killer pitch that once you are done nothing else should come to mind my last question for you is whats your advice to a lot of young african entrepreneurs who are probably watching this and are inspired by a story what would you advise to them in whatever career that theyre pursuing so its possible to build and be successful you know on the continent surround yourself with great minds i would say do heart things very early because if you do the hard things first and you know everything just becomes much easier i mean if i look at my career look look at the the the quality or the the the complexity of projects i took on very early and they have all contributed to the reputation and the trust people have in me today get out of your comfort zone i mean thats been very important for me im really grateful to to south africa in a way and my bad stayed in nigeria i dont think i would have built water abuse today so get out of your comfort zone um if it means you know giving you a chance at activating your your full potential and remember that we all have a lot of work to do collectively right when it comes to rewriting um the narrative around our country and contribute your positive stories as much as you can we need to tell these stories right if we dont tell the stories we will be swallowed by negativity and we wont matter right so its one thing to be great is another thing to tell your story so tell your story its not bragging right um it is important for the culture right we all exist we are all over the world right um you know and um when tyler you know spoke to me about this opportunity my first action was colonel you dont want to expose yourself to this but bruh we need to tell the stories right um you know and contribute our quarter to you know to the development of nigeria as a country right so so yeah thats my advice thank you thats an amazing way to round out this interview thank you very much for taking the time out to share your story with me and thank you for also inviting me to this year

mxiEI65M9_M,free tech for everyone,Tech,this is the biggest 10 million subscriber video youve ever seen i mean just for starters weve got new profile picture new channel banner and a completely next level outro that youll see at the end but more importantly its finally time to announce six things six major developments that ive been working on for a long time our completely upgraded room the largest tech giveaway in history how are going to help to save the planet a recordbreaking collab that ive somehow managed to keep completely quiet a double youtube diamond play button unboxing and finally an answer to the single most asked question ive ever had why is this channel actually called mr whos the boss so buckle up this is gonna be fun okay this room we use this room to film every single one of our videos this room has had over 2 billion views so heres what ive done to take it to the next level we got a custom neon sign that can be coded to display whatever color we want i hired a sound engineer to come into the space and completely optimize our audio quality with lots of little things like these acoustic panels up top to absorb all traces of echo listen out for it in future videos ive converted our storage room into a second set which specializes in topdown video so all those unboxing shots we do theyre about to level up ive installed a projector screen right in front of our backdrop which means that without moving any lighting or any camera gear we can have two completely different looking video backgrounds but the single biggest improvement is these nanoleaf panels for years now weve had the same triangular arrangement on either side and to be fair its been great at helping us to match the color of the room to the theme with the video but it was finally time to step up ive spent months now going back and forth back and forth with nanoleaf just hashing out dozens of potential ways to arrange different kinds of panels on these walls until it finally occurred to me that if we just fill the entire space with square panels then the whole wall effectively just becomes a digital canvas that we can paint with color youre gonna see some cool stuff from this okay youve seen giveaways before giveaways of iphones giveaways of 10 phones you might have even entered in a few yourself never one like this ive pulled together with marquez from mkbhd and dbrand to create the tech giveaway to end all giveaways so this is whats up for grabs 10 iphone 13 pro maxes each of which will come out the box with a matte black dbrand skin preapplied and 10 samsung galaxy s22 ultras each of which will come with the new dbrand atomic edition case which is ridiculously nice but theres more 20 playstation 5s each one customized to come with dbrand dark plates but theres more 30 of the new oled nintendo switch with dbrand skins applied and 50 dbrand grip cases made for whichever phone you have but theres more 80 pairs of the latest airpods 3 all d branded and 100 tshirts and not just any tshirts you might know that in my entire youtube history ive not made a single product to sell to you and thats because i just want to be absolutely sure that when i do eventually release something its gonna be special but in the meantime i have made something just to say thank you specifically this tshirt right here im not gonna spoil them all but this design is handcrafted and its absolutely packed with easter eggs from our videos and the only 50 that exist im giving away for free to you in this giveaway and thats being paired with 50 shirts from marquezs end and these are again custom made the histogram is the data representing a photo that he has taken all this stuff is printed its bought its inhouse and it is ready to ship and the benefit of using dbrands giveaway platform is that it is completely transparent you enter the giveaway just by following our social media accounts which are in the description but then at any time in the future you can head to dibrans website to see the progress of the giveaway and whos winning what but theres even more see to get this channel to that 10 million number a lot of things have had to go my way ive worked hard yes really hard but i cant ignore the fact that this earth has been very good to me so ive made it one of my 2022 missions to give back to not just my viewers but also the planet i want to focus on not just tech for me and tech for you but tech for everyone and heres stage one of that for every single one of you who enters in this giveaway which is completely free to do by the way ill also be making a two cent donation to solar 8 theyre a charity whos taking extremely poor families who would otherwise be using fuels like kerosene to light fires just so that they can see in the dark and giving them solar powered bulbs and ive picked it because it is such a winwin itll mean that these families will no longer have to breathe in dangerous fumes they dont have to worry about their houses catching on fire it means that they no longer have to spend their already limited savings on light kids can study late into the evening improving education but also the emissions to the planet that are saved from this are astronomical every single person on this earth benefits and so the minute that i pitched this idea to marquez he said i will match that donation so on top of all the prizes every single time someone enters this giveaway i will give two cents and marquez will give two cents which when you factor in that between our channels we have 25 million subscribers we could do something enormous here ill remind you again at the end to enter but for now ive got something mindbending to show you the secret collab so you might know that we have a lot of smartphones in fact if youve got a really keen eye then youll notice that every video theyve been spilling further and further out that cupboard and theyre just about to engulf my mouse and keyboard which is completely insane someone did notice someone whos now a good friend of mine matt from diy perks hes constantly building these really hightech projects on his channel and so when he saw all the phones he had an idea i present to you the largest the most advanced smartphone storage system in history so first of all this thing is enormous we have to bring it up in four separate huge parts just so it would fit up my staircase and thats because the cabinet is not built to store 100 smartphones or 200 smartphones but 1 000 and not just store them for every single smartphone mat is designed and individually 3d printed a custom clip thats actually capable of holding every single one in a completely upright position i mean not only is that borderline genius but just imagine the tedium of having to individually print and fit that many of the same piece again and again but i havent even shown you the best bit and im not even talking about literally the best plastic peel of my entire life what an honor so im with matt right now everything is wired up it is ready to go and hes about to show me the the secret weapon of this storage system yes so aaron weve solved a massive issue with this already but lets say you want to find a phone quickly pick a phone uh nokia 9 well thats where this secret weapon comes into play what are you about to do are you ready oh there you go oh what so weve got a database we can update it with any phone you like you can change it as you want and it will highlight that phone when selected from a server all running independently on the shelf yeah so you think thats good are you ready i think so okay three two one what music oh my god oh how cool is that thats gamechanging its so mister whos the boss as well it is so multiple rgb everything yeah i cant you smashed it thats oh but heres something else that you do not see every day so you probably know that when a youtube channel hits 10 million subscribers youtube themselves will send that creator a diamond play button but what you might not have known is that at this point you also get the option to buy additional play buttons for your team and that is what ive done so these two guys right here joes our editing wizard and josh our camera magician have been with me through everything we have worked through the night together weve sat in random parks in the rain waiting for 5g to get videos to upload like every bit of like editing sparkle or cool camera technique that you see we have like perfected it together so it is one play button each the slight hitch though the reason this is a double unboxing odd triple unboxing is that mine didnt arrive so i guess were just gonna experience this vicariously through these two probably watch more unboxings than anyone on this planet i know the backs of your hands better than you do thanks sue thank you yeah you should know ive only been here since five minutes so this mine gonna be like a half yeah music thats huge crazy that is very very nice i dont want to touch it that is incredible thank you sue um smells like 10 million its a privilege to like receive this with you guys leave it with you yeah like its incredible okay but theres one question that if youre watching this channel theres a very good chance that youve thought about mr whos the boss what is that ive been told a thousand times that its obnoxious even more times that its grammatically incorrect shouldnt it be whos with an apostrophe look closer mr whos the boss you know my name right my name is aaron thats b name and the only name that i go by on this channel but the reason for that is you already know my other names my surname many and my middle name rupesh the original plan was for that to be my first name so praise be that that didnt happen now i get a lot of questions about the whos but if you look really closely you realize that whos isnt asking who what its what i wanted this channel to be i wanted to be about wearables i was sure that they were about to become huge handhelds they were like 50 of my content in the early days optics because cameras are a priority to me smartphones the product that kicked off my entire fascination in tech and earphones i loved earphones 11 years ago i love your phones now five topics that you could say i wanted to become the boston but the boss isnt just what i wanted to become its its also how i was planning to get there from the very very beginning i decided that if i was going to achieve my goals that i was going to have to work towards videos that were bold i needed my own angle i had to do something that other people werent doing organic i made a promise to myself to to never become someone who would just take money to become a brand messenger surprising i wanted each piece of content to catch people off guard to put a smile on peoples faces and most importantly succinct the last thing that ive ever wanted to do was to waste your time that was a promise i made to myself 11 years ago and id like to think ive kept to it or i made that entire thing up and i actually used a random name generator now just before i show you this new outro i just wanna thank you for 10 million thanks for my rule milo and me rick never gonna give tanko never gonna shut tag down im never gonna run around and stop rick rolling you and on that note this outro im so excited about it weve weve basically taken the song that you guys really liked from our 2020 outro and created our own remix from the ground up just for this so thanks once again for 10 million just like what and make sure you check out that giveaway link is in the description my name is aaron this is mr whos the boss music

j8TcR4ihSyE,im not at man utd to compete for 6th or 7th  cristiano ronaldo says ralf rangnick needs time,Sport,cristiano great to see you again thank you first question is how are you im good and you im very well but i havent just missed the game for manchester united so how are you no im good i just have a little uh a little touch but you know its part of the my work you know we have to feel some pain sometimes but its nothing nothing big and i hope to be good soon for the weekend i hope so we will try tomorrow i will i will i will do it i will try to to training normal and lets see our body reacts and um im fingers crossed i im confident i remember the cristiano first time around when you couldnt play you werent you werent a happy boy how are you now youre a little bit older when you miss a game well you you are more mature as you mentioned before so i know better my body to dont say on the percent but i think im i know about 100 and mature experience experience give you the possibility for you to understand your mind your body everything around football so its good im im a different person im a different player but the ambition is still the same i want to i want to play and help the team talking of differences a lots happened since the last time we had a sitdown chat you have a a new manager ollies gone how do you reflect on the on the last couple of months here well not easy to be honest not easy that we change the first coach only after for carrick and after for for this this new coach its difficult to be honest when you change too much its its always tough but i i still believe that we are capable to do it a good season we know we knew it thats going to take time to make the ideas of new coach in a pitch is not its not that fast but im looking forward that we have to to be professional we have to work hard we have to be together as a players to change the page we know that we are not in in the best moment but i believe that with the work uh working hard we can achieve important things even this year you said you have to be together there i mean luke shaw said after the walls game that you werent on the pitch how important is it that everybody is the key is the keys not only the players but all the staff coaches physios uh doctors players you know this is a squad this is like a second family for all of us so we have to be together we are in the same boat and um we knew it since the beginning that will be will be easy so new year we have to believe that that is possible but as i mentioned before we we have many many you have a long way to change so but i believe i believe that were going to do it a good season given your relationship with ollie previously and was that difficult when when he left for you personally because obviously when you came back he was the man in charge of course hes always hes always sad and always tough when you you see a manager i see ollie that you used to play with me before now as a coach a fantastic person when he left everyone he was sad but you know its part of of the life is part of the football when things dont dont go the way the the club want and the fans the club have to change so for me i was disappointing but in the same time i was we have to understand the club the people who manage the club so it was difficult but you know life continue and how different has it been under ralph ranyek what are the what are the changes hes trying to implement christianity well hes he arrived years five weeks ago it changed many things but any time you know to put his ideas through the players and in a pitch as well it takes time but i i believe that he that he gonna do with a a good job we knew it that we dont play the best footballer as i as we we should do but we have many many games to improve but since they arrive i think in some points we are better but as i told you before you need in your time its it its not that that easy to change the mentality of players and the way they play the system and the culture uh like that so i believe that he youre going to do it a good job you mentioned a few interesting words there system which is on the pitch you also said mentality how crucial is that can you be successful if the mentality isnt right impossible i think its the main point i im always speak with my my friends and i and we had a shot about football the games and they all speak about the system but the system which is useful if the mentality its its not there in a pitch this is why i say we have long way to improve because for me the most important things is for you to look yourself and say i can do it better i can i can tell i can help the team much much more the system is important yes its important everything is important the small details make a huge difference in the end of the day but for me the most important thing its the mentality for you to be professional help the team the right mentality selftalk positive i think its all the details depend of you not the coaches the fans the press depends on you if you are proud of yourself and you have some dignity i think you you have to do it much more start with me my new year i try to improve even different things and better things um music to help the team i think its its its the main point we are all here to make the things even better so lets try so when you look around that dressing room its character first and foremost before talent and the and the ball at your feet that you need as i told you before we have to have the right mentality uh i looked to myself and i say christian what you can do it better to improve your level to help the team yeah yes i can improve other things maybe dont know to sprint in 19 minutes if something happened to help my teammates when you suffer or is tired you know the small details during the the game and to be smart to be intelligent to see what the games bring you understand because all the games is different all the places is different this system the stadiums you have to be capable and and ready uh when you suffer when you struggle in a game you know to be compact to run for your for your teammate and uh be a team for me this is why we call they call this club manchester united so we have to be united in in the difficult moments and with all your experience of the club and the game do you think off the pitch you can be a help to some of the younger players in in that sense yes of course the mature players the older players they can help always the the young players but i can give example if if i give you advice even if you are younger than me and youve if youre not implant that during your daily life will be difficult you can speak all day with with that person if hes not coming from inside of you its its impossible i remember when i was 18 19 20 some old players speak with me but i put that as a christian you have to improve they know more than you they are more experienced than you they pass through many bad moments but the other people they dont accept that if you criticize the young i dont say this generation the the our players but in general i have kids i know sometimes when you be a little bit harder they do it the opposite you have to find the right balance to speak with them but in my opinion the the main point its the coming from inside you you should be proud of yourself and look in the mirror and say listen i give everything and i think all of us we should do that because new year we change the page we have many things to win we have to believe on that if not it will be will be a a nightmare its interesting because when you were here you had so many big players giving you advice you chose to listen and as you say it was came from within so ultimately its up to the to the individual i think so individual is the most important thing uh we are here to help if when they need my help and my supports and my advices i will be the number one to help but if you dont want my help so do it your job look for yourself and do it your best to help the team talking of leadership the wolves game it was bad result but you led out manchester united with that armband at all trafford for the first time and knowing what the club means to you what what of all the things youve done in your career what was that moment like i know the result didnt go the way but that moment emerging from the tunnel im always im always proud not just because i i was the captain of manchester im im captain for my country i think is nothing bigger than than that for the next the last eight years nine ten i dont know but this its its good responsibility uh im back to manchester because i love this club its not just because of the money or whatever its not all because of that i coming because i love this club and i not believe that we have huge potential to win stuff to win important things but we have to find the best way to achieve that results but as i told you before i i believe but you have a few things that you have to change and you have to be and you have to accept i think its its the main word its to accept when youre not in your best shape on in your best moment we have many we have long way we have long way to improve but i believe new here we have to thinking that things go go to change for a better place when you say change what needs to change though im not the cr the right person to say we have to change this on that i think in general lets be honest the last five six games you think manchester play very well no no you know that everyone know that we have placed we have our can say we can we have time to improve yes we have we have a potential squad we have new manager why we dont believe that we can do it better we have to believe you have to be positive to try to change things you know to play as manchester united fans want and the history of the club this is why we have to we are we were not going to give up you know they only give up to the guys who is weak mentally this is why i mentioned in in the beginning new here you have to implant that in your mind that we have we are capable to change things now i dont know this specific way because im a player im not a coach im not the president i know the way but as you know im not going to mention here because i think its not ethic from my part to say that what i can say and what something that we are in on control we can do it better all of us and if that is a collective what what collective individual everyone and what could you achieve then if if you get that big things that manchester belong in important things so we have to change that i dont want to be here in a club to to fight to be in the sixth place or seventh place or fifth place or you know im here to try to win to to compete and i think we compete but we are not yet in our best level but we have long way to improve and i believe that if we we change our mind we can we can achieve a big things a lot of its in the mind then i think so yes and what do you think even going back to that day when we spoke when you came back and scored the two goals against newcastle everyone was on the up everyone was talking about the title not fourth place what whats the difference between then and now do you think whats happened because you didnt foresee that what would you expect yeah i was i was happy surprise was very good that my first year my score two goals but the football little the league to win the league its a marathon its not a sprinter under metro sprint you have to be consistent consistency and um this is why the best play the best team right now in england probably is manchester city and liverpool and chelsea because they are more consistent that there are other teams but i believe that we have to look at that and believe that we are capable to do it the same way we know its tough we have to improve but i believe uh some things have to change but i believe that we have we have the potential here so we have to do the right things he is is the only way to be in that level of that things that i mentioned before and its the reason you believe because when you look around and train every day with these players the ability and and the talent that youve got in the manchester united group at the moment 100 this is what i believe i still believe but as i told you and im gonna repeat some things have to change interesting in terms of the premier league the standard the the global um eyes on it is it is it i know youve had the problems but is it fantastic to be back on that stage lovely for you lovely to be back on the premier league which is in my opinion the last probably five six years is the best league in the world its always in the top of the world but especially the last five years is very competitive league very difficult league all the teams even as they call the the smallest team they they look bigger when they they play against big teams without doubts i think its by far the best league in the world and you when you go around the world do you see that do you see that phenomenon if you like i play everywhere so i can say the difference and the level and i can say 100 that premier league is by far the most difficult and the most special league in the world the last six years and exactly is that when you you look at the level of coaches weve got and the level of players that want to either play in it or in your case come back to play in it this is why im i as people know im a challenge person i like to you know to challenge first of all myself not i think its the most important this is why im coming back because i i think im still capable to do it important things and good things and uh impress people so this is why i back the the to manchester is a club that i love it everyone know that and uh to play the premier league which is the most competitive league right now in a moment and apart from the frustration on the pitch that youre mentioning is is everything set are you enjoying being back in england im im back living here with a family and yes you know im a moment of my life that um im settled on everything so for me its its another step in my in my career so so its good family is happy kids are happy im happy and um i wouldnt i want to carry on like that you do like challenges youve had many in your career where does this one in the next four or five months then to get push united back into those champions league places that youre talking about things have to change how big a challenge is that every weekend is a challenge im not going to look in the future im looking at present the present is now the moment is now we have saturday a big game where that we have to to try or to try to win of course and step by step as i mentioned before we have to improve game by game ill leave the present the present for me is the most important the future we will come so to think in the present we have a difficult match saturday and uh after the champions league in february i hope that were going to be more prepared you know to have that huge amount that were going to have very very tough games that were going to be more prepared you know to fight against that big teams yeah you mentioned the champions league coming up there for next season for this club how important how crucial is it to be in it again then in terms of the key yes i thought manchester united should be or should win the league or be in second or third not i dont see other possession for manchester united to be honest i dont i dont see in my eyes i dont accept that our mentality be less that to be in a top three in a premier league in my opinion and that has to be drilled into everybody of course around the club i think to build up a good things sometimes you have to detroy destroy a few things so why not new here a new life and i hope that manchester can be the level that people want especially the fans that they deserve that you can sense that from the supporters at the moment yes yes they deserve because they they single all game they are there all the games and they want good performance from our us players so we have to give at least something to them we won that is the most important the last game for example but as as everyone knows we dont perform the way we want but i still believe and i still positive that we have a long way to improve because you know this club is not always the winning its the way you win exactly i think we can make the two things together in a perfect scenario so just finally then what would be success sitting here now at the end of may for manchester united this season right now i hope to win two one one title to go through in the champions league and be at least enough right now the way we are uh to be in the top four and for that to happen your message to the supporters would be what be the way be the same that they did until now i mean defense were gonna give our best were gonna try to change things for a better way and thank you for them support and carry on like that because when they are like that we are more positive and we are all together i think we can we can improve a lot okay well great to see you thank you very much thank you

bottled up a little bit of hellfire lets go to location number two here at the food truck known as taste the real nollens the jefferson family offers their own northern twist on classic southern new orleans dishes i was told if you go to new orleans and say new orleans youre going to get punched in the face thats how they talk down there whos keeping it out there okay my mother shes from minnesota but she went down to new orleans to learn how to cook the food and she brought it back up here from the world thats why we say taste the real numb i love that your mom doesnt want to be interviewed but secretly she kind of does today im getting shrimp and grits why do grits and shrimp go together they go together because it tastes good it just tastes good first coat the shrimpies in frying powder and give them a little bit of a dip in hot oil you know grits is a southern thing its like cream of wheat but made with corn exactly yeah their creamy grits are made by slow cooking a mixture of salt water fine cornmeal pepper jack and cheddar cheese the final step is to combine the shrimp and the grits together so they can create their own new orleans chats its music for your mouth here ive got mostly shrimp lets try it out oh no does someone have a dog that likes seafood hey does your dog like shrimp oh yeah hey thanks buddy nothing wasted i was distracted i didnt even taste it theres a beautiful crunchy breading juicy and might i say shrimpy on the inside im gonna just get some grits alone oh theyre so rich its almost cheesy they put shrimp throughout the grits its like a yogurt parfait but with the layers of shrimp and grits next im getting dessert this is a beignet a must try for those visiting new orleans a doughy sweet pastry with a french influence start by dropping the dough into hot oil let it puff up and transform into a succulent shade of golden brown ive had beignets in new orleans they were about this big but you got little cute ones yeah with a minnow soda twig now for the sweetness a snowy sprinkling of powdered sugar then a couple sides for dipping chocolate sauce and a caramel pecan sauce im gonna go plain jane at first lets try it out music applause im always thinking theres gonna be pillowy inside but inside is dense i like this take on the beignet beyond that its crispy on the outside its very steamy very warm and fresh this sauce is speaking to me i can tell you when i was in new orleans they did not have a caramel sauce with pecans this might be the minnesota twist right here enjoy it close your eyes and go to a happy place thats what im doing the seasonal depression is lifting away i want my bite uhhuh im very traveling and people say like hey food is medicine i agree for me its an antidepressant five dollars for this you get four fried pieces two sauces not a bad deal lets keep moving music my next stop elevation 5280 the truck behind me is colorado themed when you think of colorado you may conjure images of rocky mountain oysters or certain herbal delicacies here they offer food thatll flood your brain with much more dopamine inspired by choleridian southwest cuisine theyve created a menu full of reimagined classics like tacos or loaded fries but of course they offer their own twist right here the colorado fries what are they its the rocky mountains of meats and cheeses placed atop starchy fried goodness it consists of seasoned french fries colorado pork green chili sauce chicken something special happens when you smoke barren water you get really creative in the kitchen chihuahua cheese chipotle crema and pico de gallo im not saying thats the inspiration for what is in my hand right now but oh man people in canada are jealous its almost like a poutine but better oh it tastes like chipotle chicken beautifully grilled beautifully seasoned so much flavor mix that with the pico de gallo a little hint of freshness and then this creamy colorado pork green chili sauce is that right thats right you can see im slowly getting to the french fry layer its like a taco salad without any of those greens music this is a delicious mess ten dollars for this whole thing and they dont skimp on anything the perfect partner to unconventional nachos even more unconventional tacos right here bulgogi tacos start by grilling corn tortillas then fill them with bulgogi or korean grilled beef this is one of koreas most popular meat offerings it literally means fire meat add coleslaw hoisin sauce sriracha and top it with cilantro lots of awesome asian flavors lets try it out theyve got pickled slaw and theres a perfect blend to this very sweet very salty savory sauce thats on top i love that mexico and korea are finally uniting two countries that really have almost nothing to do with each other but now theyre finally coming together here in my mouth two tacos eight dollars im very impressed at this moment i have spent 45 dollars im almost to the halfway mark and i think my stomach is about to the halfway mark too now were heading to our next location where is it music im in a food truck with duggar how you doing good how are you doing fantastic im looking at four giant paella pans this one feeds about 100 wow thats wild paella is a traditional spanish dish with endless possible varieties here at paella depot doug is introducing his take on this foreign food to adventurous minnesota folks it started about 25 30 years ago i stumbled across these pants from spain and then decided well the only way im going to sell the paintings is to figure out how to make great paella and ultimately people love the dish so much i stopped focusing on selling pans and started selling the product dougs career changing creation begins with a rich flavor foundation of olive oil garlic onions chorizo their signature spice blend saffron and tomatoes it may be a new food to a lot of people here in minnesota are a lot of people confused about what this dish even is most of them yes we kind of came up with the idea of like the hot dish of spain because were in minnesota and its all about the hot dish music now its time to add the rice and mix what kind of rice are you using and we use bomba rice so its a spanish valencian short grain rice this rice caramelizes it doesnt get creamy they add chicken stock to enrich the dish even more now the final ingredients chicken salt green zucchini leeks and bell peppers but doug still has one more trick up his sleeve theres this dark brown part that is the most prized part because its gonna just be so crunchy and full of flavor we build up that crust over and over again that richness that comes in any dish like thats where it comes from now some people only do one crust you can do things a traditional way but what actually has the best flavor im gonna go try it i cant wait please make sure i get a lot of that crusty stuff you bet im gonna try some of the rice thats so satisfying beautiful spices its rich buttery im gonna hit that with some egg yolk and thats just gonna beautifully cascade and spill onto the rest of the rice oh hello its a little ravine of yolk lets take a bite of that one of my best bites so far the yolk is so creamy its rich its on top of this beautifully textured rice its a great combination okay guys i want you to pan over to doug right now i have a feeling doug right now is pitching people on what the heck is the paella i appreciate that hes kind of like a culinary ambassador for the paella over here theres some vegetables theres chorizo smoky crunchy and chicken too we have so many animals involved i didnt even know i love it im very impressed and im very proud of doug but everyones going left hes making paella and hes killing it next truck the food train is trucking along next up original hockey mom brownies once upon a time a mother got her sons entire hockey team hooked on her sweet ooey gooey brownies and now shes doing the same to folks all around the state if youre simple you can get a brownie for six seven dollars but if you want to take it to the next level you get ice cream you get a layer of brownie which is called the slab shot its a smore and peanut butter brownie combined and then on top of that you get whipped cream some caramel some chocolate and then a dusting of butterfinger guts music oh its so rich music it is this beautiful layering of sweet confection all coming together to make a delicious treat try another bite smores have chocolate peanut butter has peanut butter and those two are really meant to be together its like burning ernie when we found out that they werent just roommates theyve been lovers this whole time apparently so far we spent 69 we have 31 to go im getting kind of full at this point we got to keep going i am determined to break a hundred dollars i have a pocket full of cash but a stomach that could burst at any moment the only logical strategy in order to complete this challenge go fancy you might not expect to find a full lobster menu at a food truck festival here in minnesota far far from the ocean that would be until you serendipitously stumble upon rebel lobster music here they specialize in lobster rolls mine starts with fresh chilled maine lobster rolled in mayonnaise then stuffed deep inside a buttered and grilled new england roll a monster sandwich it has the whole arm of a lobster inside coming in 26 were not at 100 yet but were getting there were real close they put a lemon in the middle and then on the side my favorite condiment actual pure butter you can dip your fries in it you can dip your loved ones in it its just gonna make everything better give it a little bit of a spritz we need citrus we need some lightness were talking about balance here folks lets take a bite wow the bread and butter alone is very satisfying if you look into the roll you can see this is full of lobster meat look at this this is like the thumb of the lobster its giving me the thumbs up its giving me the go ahead to take another bite this is a whole seafood meal right here remember i said bring all your friends with you forget it go by yourself bring 26 just get this go home alone be happy oh youre not youre not hungry for dinner tonight now with lana and the outlaw grill food truck so the foundation of everything here revolves around the tot it does i feel like tater tots are like this nostalgic item and so now weve taken this tater tot something weve had in our hot dishes something weve had at school lunch is it the same tater tot do you do something different we get kind of a more pure tater tot its just potatoes and salt thats it theres a lot of them on the market that are name brand that have a lot of seasonings already added to them it messes with them so we start there and then we add our own seasoning to it we fry them a certain way so if they get crispy then we just ramp it up with all the goodies go on top of all the goodies here lana recommends her favorite the pulled pork burrito known also as the bank heist on a flour tortilla they add their special tater tots and shredded cheddar cheese ive eaten so many foods today this is gonna be kind of my dessert then a generous portion of pulled pork with barbecue sauce whatever tiny pocket the space thats left in my stomach this is gonna fill top that with their very own coleslaw called outlaw slaw and of course ranch um i was hoping i had a question that would come like do you have any advice you should get some jalapenos on it oh yeah they basically have taken a whole minnesota meal and put it in one burrito lets try it out you ready im ready i like that its spicy its meaty its sour the coleslaw it brings everything together theres nice little fried bits in there they pulled pork delicious soft and it just kind of melts in your mouth im telling you this is food number nine and ive got as much gusto as i had when i started my final favorite thing about this burrito is that it is featuring the tot and this woman this entrepreneur and her husband have made a food truck that revolves completely around the tater tot of course they do dress it up a bit theyre doing great work and im very impressed from here all there is to do is add up all the food from today and see we spent a hundred dollars i freaking hope so i cannot eat anymore music the numbers are being calculated the math is being mapped and out of all these foods today nine foods i believe i spent 108 i gotta say this is the first time i have legitimately completed this challenge guys i hope youre as pumped as i am about this legendary achievement thank you so much for watching i hope you enjoyed seeing a little slice of minnesota a place where we call paella spanish hot dish a place where we put tater tots in anything being an influencer doesnt require millions of fans all you need is this tshirt entertain and inspire at your own pace dont be an influencer be a micro influencer get your shirt now is this even impressive anymore its a hundred dollars all the americans watching are like thats just kind of normal a normal amount now due to inflation this may become a two hundred dollar challenge the dogs back im gonna be one more here we go dont bite my finger good good boy or girl and sometimes i dont have a friend to come with me and share or a girlfriend i have a wife though thats pretty good shell love that one i got it ive got it ive got a what a tape oh look at that dog in the backpack that shouldnt be allowed either how cute is that oh i miss my dog as much street food truck oh god hold on theres another one going to handle the food truck that is it for this one thank you so much for watching i will see you next time a piece
a-msUTaaxd4,introducing victoria a new sailing tender s3e1,Art,music im just returning home from the wooden boat show out in mystic connecticut now if you missed the live announcement steve from acorn to arabella announced that i will be building the tender for his beautiful boat arabella on my way back i stopped in granby massachusetts at steves boatyard now while i was there he loaded me up with all kinds of boat building materials that id be able to build the tender out of so some of the things that he gave me are some old growth mahogany honduras mahogany some tamarack knees and over on my trailer there is some pine black locusts quarter sawn white oak 100 year old white cedar planking and more mahogany the majority of the materials that ill be using for the tender came from a atkins boat victoria which was a 32foot cutter and was built in 192627 about five years ago steve purchased the boat victoria with the intention to reuse the bronze and some of the materials in the building of arabella id like to invite you to watch or rewatch his episode 21 our lady victoria where he talks about the boat and how hes going to reuse some of those materials since the majority of the materials to build the tender will have come from victoria the tender will also bear the same name victoria in honor of that grand vessel well ive got a good portion of the materials organized but im still going to need to find a place to store the planks in a good handy place so that ill be able to get to them easily but let me show you some of the mahogany and some of the special pieces that ive gotten from steve so let me look at this first so this is some 3 8 inch tongue and grooved mahogany that looks like its i would say its about almost two inches wide this was used for the ceiling of the cabin in victoria you can see ive got quite a bit of it here and what my plan is is to use this on some of the bulkheads uh that will be in the tender um really gorgeous gorgeous wood and im pretty excited to dig into it clearly ive got a lot so there may be some other projects that i can think of to use it for the other exciting thing that came from victoria are these tamarack knees well ive got quite a few of them here it looks like theres one two three four five six knees so these are beautiful knees you can see the how the graining their growth knees where the grain runs in the corner that you want it to be they vary in thickness this looks like about an inch and a half and i think the thickest one is down here on the bottom and it looks to be i would say maybe two and a half something like that now i uh steve ran these through the planer so you can see the how the grain has come out on it one of the things that i will probably do is i probably will resaw them down so that theyll be closer to three quarters of an inch thick and ill probably only be using a smaller section out of them than instead of the whole thing because it just wont require that much but ill put the knees in where the thwart the center seat is there are some knees there ill use one of them for the breast hook and then ill always also use a couple of them at the stern where the in whales and out whales come and meet there so anyway i was pretty excited to get these um theyre really beautiful and as you can see ive got a lot here i probably will be able to use these in future projects as well now theres also ive got a whole bunch of mahogany so the mahogany over here you can see these curved pieces right here these were the beams for the cabin roof theyre all mahogany so i will be able to use partials parts of those in the tender as well and then ive got some big chunks of oak here that obviously did not come out of victoria but were pieces that steve had left over from building arabella some really beautiful quartersawn oak that im sure ill be able to use the other thing i wanted to show you was the stem that steve gave me so the stem is also solid mahogany when i saw it it sat like this in the boat like i said solid mahogany and in the art world we would call this a readymade and that its already a beautiful piece of sculpture without really doing much to it i think what my plan is that ill um get the paint off of it and maybe plane it down a little bit to expose some of that beautiful mahogany and but ill probably leave some of these kind of rough parts in here so that you can kind of tell where it came from out of the boat now ive got another little piece there on the floor that is also a part of the stem that perhaps i can use as a base or something like that but anyway thatll be a future project a little readymade sculpture from victoria so those are some of the special pieces that came out of victoria now ill need to reorganize my storage rack here so that i can store some of this mahogany up in there so i can get to it easily as well so lets take a look at some of the plans and talk a little bit about some of the parameters that steve has set out for me to build this tender ive pinned up two construction drawings of two different boats here uh both of these were drawn by william atkins now thats important in that as youll remember that i said victoria was designed by william atkins and also arabella is designed by william atkins so it was really important for steve that we would build a dinghy that had a william axe axons design so there are two plans here this one is called handy andy and it is a sailing dinghy and the other one is called fey and it is also sailing dinghy now they are pretty much the same with one big difference and the big difference is is that handy andy is only eight feet long and fay is ten feet long now this presents a little bit of a problem in that in order for the boat to sit on top of the cabin roof which would be upside down uh there are some parameters that need to be met so the first parameter is that from the companion way to the mast is just a little bit more than nine feet so steve has asked that the dinghy only be nine feet in its overall length now the second thing is that there is a hatch that is on the top of the cabin roof and that hatches so you can get materials in and out of it without having to go through the companion way so that hatch will be raised up a little bit so that the water will shed off of it and that hatch then needs to fit inside of the dinghy properly so that means that between the front seat to the main thwart seat in the center there needs to be enough space for that hatch to fit up in there so some other parameters that are not in these plans that steve would like is that he wants it to be as light and strong as possible well both of these plans well actually i know that faye was drawn in 1933 there are no dates on handy andy but given the similarities in the two i would think that they were drawn very close at the same time so one of the things about a boat designed in 1933 is that there are a whole bunch of frames that then had cedar planking on it and then that was covered with a canvas now what were going to do you know use some more modern technology and that were going to eliminate as m all of the frames actually itll turn out were going to eliminate all the frames were going to plank it a strip plank it with cedar and then glass cloth it on both sides so thats where were going to get our strength is from the glass cloth is why well be able to remove all of those frames now one of the reasons were doing that is that that way the interior of the boat stays pretty clean and steve would like a boat that would be very easy to keep clean by just simply washing it out and dumping the water out if theres all those little frames in there its a place where stuff can get caught it also is going to add a tremendous amount of weight to the dinging and as you can imagine this is a boat were going to have to lift out of the water and up onto the deck and then turn over and probably a oneperson operation to do that so thats one consideration is were removing all of the frames and were going to use cedar and glass cloth now were going to get some of that strength back in that at the um four well well put in a bulkhead actually at the four here and well put a bulkhead at the aft now what that will do is be able to create a couple of airtight chambers because the other thing that steve would like is that it be an unsinkable boat now what he meant by unsinkable is that if it gets swamped and gets filled with water it wont go to the ocean floor so we need a couple of air chambers in there to stop that from happening now one of the benefits to doing that putting bulkheads here is a couple of things one it adds some strength there as though it was a frame so the other thing is that that will give us a some storage space in the fore and aft part of the dinghy that some storage can be put in there now the other thing is where the center seat is now i think i had mentioned that these this is going to be a sailing dinghy so the sailing dinghy requires a dagger board in it the dagger board in this particular drawing here a fay the seat is right here and the center trunk is here so were going to do is move the center trunk back a little bit as we shorten the end here and then move the seat forward a little so that the center board trunk fits exactly where the seat is and the seat probably will become a little wider now in addition to the four and aft bulkheads well put a bulkhead on each side of that seat so that well also have basically some center support in the center of the a midship of the dinghy so i had mentioned that it will be a sailing dinghy and ive got a couple the two sail plans for handy annie and feyer here where steve is more in favor of phase rig which is a spirit rig the nice thing about a spirit rig is they come down very easily and you can wrap the sails around it so you have a nice uh small smite a nice package for the sail to be stored in now one of the other things that ill be making in addition to the spars for the sale is im going to also make a set of ores for it and well make the oars out of some ash steve provided me with a really big beautiful slab of ash that ill be able to make some oars out of so you can see with some of the parameters that i need to work with in either lengthening handy andy or shortening fay and also some of those constraints with where that center hatch will fit im going to need to draw an entirely new line drawing and essentially end up almost redesigning a new boat now the important part here is that it will still be an atkinesque atkinsesque boat youll still have the lines of an atkins much the way that the haven that im building uh that was designed by joel white was taken inspiration from the heronshop 12 and a half footer so its a new boat but it still has the characteristics of a hair shot so the same thing will be true with this itll be a new boat but itll have all of the characteristics of an atkins designed boat so therell be very little bronze needed for the tender one of the things it will need is a few cleats for the sail plan and well need to have a bronze or socket for the orlox in addition to that the only other bronze is bronze that steve has already provided to me and that is the name plate off of victoria so let me show you that and i also want to show you a special piece of burled cherry that steve shared with me that well be able to use for the ore sockets you can see ive got these really beautiful bronze letters for to spell out victoria first i want to show you this this piece is a beautiful burled cherry now steve varnished the other side so you could see how beautiful that comes out so ill only need small little pieces in order for those ore sockets to fit in there but um its really uh i think its really a nice contrast now when i originally had seen these letters i thought wow what a beautiful patina those have and i had mentioned that to steve well hes interested in them being polished and clean and brand new his feeling is that this is a rebirth and that its a brand new victoria and that everything should start off pristine and new in order to get started now eventually it probably will get patiented like this is but well let time take care of that so i thought it might be interesting in order to take at least one of them and polish it and see how well it turns out i often get asked about how you polish bronze its pretty simple actually its just starting with a heavy grit and working your way finer just like you would finishing a piece of wood so ive got a piece of rubber shelf drawer paper here drawer liner so it wont slide around on me since these have not really have any tooling marks in it im going to start with some 100 or 220 grit sandpaper and basically just get started so you can see it comes off pretty easily a quicker way to do this would be to use a sand blaster and i dont have a sand blaster youll see how this goes i may take them over to the university and use their sandblaster if it takes very long unlike wood you dont have to worry about a grain in it in fact going back and forth different ways i would call i call it cross hatching the metal will cut a little faster thats looking pretty good with really not much time at all so to get the edges im going to use some little files like this oh you can see these castings are just arent as perfect as what you would think so i think im going to do is take it over to my buffing wheel and see if i can clean some of that up a little quicker so what ive got here is this uh wheel is an expanding wheel so right now you can see the belt just slides off and on and then when it starts up the centrifugal force makes that rubber wheel expand and hold that on there and these um belts come in different grits so right now i have a uh 320 grit uh paper on there typically when when youre using a a grit with a machine it will cut faster than if its by hand so thats why i dropped down uh to 320 on this so well turn this on whats nice about it is its is it soft and flexible so you dont dig into it like you would with a typical belt sander music laughter now well see how it does on the surface so laughter now back over here at the bench i can you can see theres still some patina in here so i have these little needle files that so im able to kind of get into that tight area there to clean it up and clean that up pretty good ive got a variety of sizes so this little flat spot i can use this small file and ive got even i have a little round one i can get in here where its got a rounded spot looks pretty good im going to go over it another time with some 220 here and get some of those get the strokes a little smoother now if you didnt have a machine like that and youre doing this by hand once we got the 220 done we can then move to a finer grit and i believe this is either 400 or 600 in this application im really mostly just worried about the face because once its on the boat the edges will not be nearly as important now the last spot are these places where the screws will go and what im going to do is take it over the drill press and just touch that with a countersink tool and that should clean all of that up so so one of the last steps i put a buffing wheel on here and ive got some buffing compound which is a little fine grits of stuff thats in a wax base we just start this and load it up a little bit and just start buffing you can see the difference there it looks pretty good but im going to do one more thing thatll really put a shine on it so the last thing that im going to do in a paper towel out here im going to put some mag mothers aluminum polish on here that will really put a nice shine on it just take a little dab put on there i usually just use another paper towel and start working on looks pretty good so now i have to do is the rest of the other letters well that turned out really nice its so pretty well some of you are probably wondering what about the haven uh where are we at as far as finishing it up when am i planning on launching it whats left to be done things like that so basically the hull is really finished and in the last episode i finished all the spars and masks now theres still quite a few pieces of bronze that i need to cast and ill need to wait until bradley university gets back in session so that i can use their facilities to cast those bronze parts but in addition to that some of the things that need to be done is all of the rigging and in the the rigging will also include making the sails so im planning on purchasing a sewing machine and sewing all of the sails myself also now as far as when it will be finished if i had pushed really hard uh and this new project wasnt on my plate i probably could have maybe gotten it in the water this year but it would have been really late in the year and because its carville plankton needs to take up it really didnt make sense to force that issue so im going to take my time and do all of those things that i had mentioned and that way ill be shooting for a uh probably a late april early may launching of the haven so as i progress along with the new tender ill also be jumping back and forth on the haven so youll see some episodes on that and some on the the tender so thanks for watching and if youre new to the channel welcome and if youve been here for a while thanks for staying with me and ill see you the next time when were going to start designing the tender for arabella thanks for watching and ill see you in the next episode music you

8DaWBMwHhmU,fashion photo ruview drag race france season 1  say it with flowers,Fashion,bonjour this is adriana and im scarlett envy and youre watching fashion photo review drag race france oui applause  were two weeks in officially to drag race france we should say from say it again please france i ive spent a lot of time uh working on my throat game so i so here we are with uh say it with flowers i have a feeling there will be very heavy feminine energy on the runway flouncy and floral and pinky and red if i was a flower i would be the dying rose emoji i think it would be an orchid because its so beautiful but still so exotic and it looks like a little vagina so its perfect and youre very delicate just like a vagina i mean an orchid i mean yeah are we ready roll the tapes so first up la premiere its kind of club kid its giving me a little shop of horrors the musical uh its very like playful and fun evie oddly energy on the main stage a little bit just like this shes very confident music like i dont want to run into her we were expecting delicate but this is completely the opposite of delicate which i love she sold us the braided look in the first episode now in the second episode shes going for that rough that we were missing in the first one even if we loved the look her gautier look was like all these like crazy braids and this weird stuff and like this is also weird and i love something super crazy and weird the jacket is good but what is she wearing under the jacket under the jacket shes got this like crazy like little shop of horrors like green catsuit on i think whats interesting about it is that what shes saying with flowers is that shes like not very floral and not very delicate and not like shes like a rocker chick definitely feels like not a whole lot of rules are followed here which is the whole idea of what punk is i dont really like this bikini bottom flower shes got right on the lapel there it seems like its just like oh its floral so like let me put one flower like right here on the thing that doesnt really match any of the rest of the outfit or anything like that its just like i think it would be more effective but like we get the the hair is the floral you know the flower is the mohawk just feels very clowny kind of im expecting water to come out of the flower because it just doesnt fit the whole look i actually like the whole look i feel that the undergarment would be maybe a little bit more fitted would have been perfect thats it for me im gonna go ahead and give it a soft toot punk rock honey rock on baby music up next cam i mean she just always looks really good i guess huh can i can i just bring her home and keep her with me its so so beautiful from the back from the front from the side girl shes got flowers in her esophagus she mentioned it its very marie antoinette shes looking gorgeous in blue hydrangeas its a southern flower its very voluminous the whole outfit reflects the flower and the structure of the flower and the color of it and everything it is very opulent but still just like welldosed nothing that i would change on this outfit and just in case it rains out there on the main stage she is like prepared exactly she is ready i mean its a hard two for me it is a very high two for me too up next la big bertha i dont know about you but i love wearing all black for floral week i like that she went in like a really harsh direction with it i would have appreciated to have maybe like some texture in the dress to make it flowery kind of because other than the crown in the back she could have worn whatever i dont like this makeup severe white line right over the beard like that seems a little strange to me the beard also looks like its painted on is there actually a beard there because it looks like its just makeup how gorgeous it would have been if she had this like silvery like blonde beard to go with this beautiful hair its looking very pedestrian for me if were gonna do this whole like im just in a simple black look the whole time until i turn around your shoes need to be on point your black dress needs to be on point you know the whole thing you really need to look snatched because 90 of the time were seeing you from the front here except for the very end when you turn around and i kind of get the joke that youre mourning your summer body i feel that if she was dressed maybe in like a a black swimsuit would have been better or like a black veil i think its funny i also get it shes a campy queen but i really like everything else and i think its just chic i think she just like she knows her hemlines she knows her necklines its just like really simple i think it was a completely unique direction so cute im going to give it a boot im sorry up next it lips im really distracted by the look what is she really saying with flowers actually i think shes an extraterrestrial doing gardening something like that the blue makeup on the face does not even slightly match the blue catsuit thing yeah thats a killer i guess theyre garden gloves which i guess maybe but they also look like theyre maybe like for the dishes the shoes i like them though oh the shoes nice and i guess theres like a little bit of a gradient i think it looks like in this shoe that does kind of pull in the makeup from the face but i dont know i just think the whole thing i dont think the dress is hitting her the right way i dont like that it hits like below the knee like that i wish it was like a little bit lower or a little bit higher the hemline of the dress yeah im not sure about the shape either i do appreciate the whole concept like extraterrestrial thing but when you choose colors just make them work together please the dress theres a lot of work on it i can see it i can see the gardening side of the look but its not its just not cohesive to me so its gonna be a booth its gonna be a boot for me so next up la brioche oh my gosh this is fun she looks really good this week i love this this is exactly what i was hoping for with like the camp aspect of some people weve seen so far this is like i think very successful and i love a shape shifter and this is giving me another side of her that we havent seen shes like marios like side chick whos like really mad loves seeing versatility on the runway if youre doing camp everything has to be on point and everything here is on point the hair the little earrings the the little mario gloves also its so much fun you know you can tell when the girls out there like just taking it so seriously and really in their head and then sometimes theyre out there just like having a good time and you can tell shes living her very best life out there its a tooth for me it is absolutely a tooth for me up next lolita banana oh wow oh my god wow queen the drama im living for the drama viva la vida uh so what does that mean like the life of drag its like drag life she looks so so good honestly she took the prompt very literally shes playing a lot with her origins right now i think yeah its very colorful hes telling us quite the story on the runway without any information at all and i love that shes giving us two different looks but both are very beautiful her makeup look good too drama viva drag viva your drag i am giving it a toot give it a toot as well thank you for the drama viva up next is paloma she is the rose and the torns are around her i mean i think its very read between the lines there are no flowers here at all the vine looks almost like it could be like some kind of a tail like i wish i would have like wrapped around one of the legs and trailed behind her yes uh or wrapped around her neck and like the sexy like oh like im being choked by my vines like oh yeah or something like that you know maybe like a giant red rose on her head you know or something exactly what i was thinking about just like her hair is just the rose i would have liked to maybe see a little more skin because we see her face um and its the only skin color that we see right now i feel like the hair could have been like more glamorous and like swept back if she was going for this whole glamorous thing instead of like this campy curly bang thing i will say i appreciate that the red wig is the same color as the red cap suit my problem is not really with the shape its really within the placement of this like purple thing you know and the fact that theres just like no flowers anywhere just now noticing it looks like shes got a floor delay on her chest which is a nice detail there yes i love the color of the vines though i think its gonna be a soft tooth for me shes not really selling it to me i think i have to boot it up next lova ladiva im not really sure what the reveal is going on in there its just kind of like this nude bodysuit thing i feel so naughty like looking at it like is that is that like is that a is that like a floral clitoris going on like whats happening can we say clitoris on fashion photo review i think so well lets say it a few more times clitoris not the glitteriest cleaner is the payoff is just not it girl like i just wish that there was a little bit more under there that we she was actually like had something to show off under there like you know flower or something like that love the size of the sleeves i like how big the shoulders are i dont mind the hair i think its really pretty and kind of like hippie dippy kind of flower child i love the flowers and the hair in fact im obsessed with it from the neck up i think her makeup looks stunning her hair is really really beautiful i like the shapes of the sleeves um i dont feel that they fit the rest of the garment feels like two different styles completely the one thing i do really love about this look is that shes wearing white pumps and you know what they say about a girl that wears white pumps she takes it from behind i think is what they say or that shes like a or something thank god im not wearing mine i love the head love the feet the rest of it im like ive had probably the most fun talking about this look so far um but i i have to boot it its a boot for me but i really had fun looking at it my god she looks so gorgeous look at this makeup are you kidding me with this makeup this hair i would totally see that makeup like unfold for some reason its giving me very floral without like hitting me over the head with it it feels very fluid the hair kind of tree trish vibes these are just like gorgeous probably very expensive human hair tracks of hair and she somehow you know attached them to these like wiggle worms that look so cool this is such a different look with the yeah squirmies and it holds its not like its wiggly or nothing i love the dress i think its super weird and crazy i love the colors together this iridescent in this copper is really amazing also i love the gloves theyre hitting her above the elbow like we like to see i think that the pleating of this dress could have been shifted in a way that complemented a hip thats not there i wish it the bottom part would be wider a little bit yeah brava guangdong brava i give it a solid two that is a very high tooth for me too train alert volume the shoulders the hairs the chitties the hips yeah the shapes the volume the skirt very uh shapey lots of flowers shapely hourglasses shoulders head

ucAWhiiFjLA,what the interest rate hike means for you,News,the bank of canada is raising the interest rate by 100 basis points the highest hike since 1998 up to 25 percent we did not take this decision lightly we are acutely aware that higher interest rates will affect canadians who are already feeling the pain of high inflation it can seem counterintuitive to add to the interest cost canadians face in order to combat the cost of inflation but by increasing the cost of borrowing we will moderate spending and return inflation to this target so cutting inflation is the goal will these latest moves get the inflation target closer in sight jimmy john is vice president and chief economist with desjardins and is in montreal armenianizian is an economist and atkinson fellow on the future of workers shes in ottawa hello to both of you good afternoon so biggest single hike since 1998 what is that kind of an increase tell us about uh how bad the circumstance is jimmy youll go to you first well weve seen this string of upward surprises and inflation in canada also in the us we saw that this morning with fresh estimates still beating consensus estimates so were still very much in a crisis of inflation control what weve seen lately in terms of the job market a very tight market uh accelerating wages in canada wages are now growing faster than they are in the us and in places like here in quebec were talking seven and a half percent wage growth so the bank of canada talked about the the risk of a wage spiral today and thats one of the motivations for this kind of outsized move so theres a number of factor but its really about winning the war on inflation and i think the bank of canada today shows that its really to do whatever it takes to really bring down inflation and im going to go to armenia in a second but jimmy we can hear you but i think your microphone might have fallen off if you just want to check that while i put kind of same question to our mean which is i mean is this a signal that the bank of canada thinks were headed toward a recession what do you think i think its a signal that they want to show that their um ability to handle inflation has not been impeded overly by things that effectively raising the interest rate cant control things like higher food prices and commodity prices things like higher oil and gas prices nothing about raising the interest rate will affect those prices but itll do two things it will affect housing prices and it will um it will cool demand and i guess thats the over overriding thing is to get people to spend less uh and because we are in a moment of effectively full employment weve got almost as many people looking for work as we have job vacancies so quite apart from unemployment rates at half century lows weve got a lot of people working so i guess they feel like this is a time they can risk trigger triggering a bit of a recession without too much pain or with less pain than they have in the past it is a gamble theyre taking a walk along the tightrope because you cool the economy too fast and you do trigger a recession but i dont think that is their intent i know that isnt their intent i hope i hope that isnt their intent anyway but they are there to cool the economy and to cool peoples expectations of what are going to happen next as jimmy pointed out todays inflation rates in the united states beat expectations and we think that that might happen in canada next wednesday when our inflation rates are announced and and i mean i mean i guess the the answer to this is it it depends on the household and it varies from household to household but how i think a lot of people are wondering today like how how serious is this pain going to be for people i actually asked um you know what share of households even hold mortgages were not even talking about the over leavers so let me just do a little russian doll thing for you over 30 of uh the of canadian households are renters another 40 percent uh own their homes but they have no mortgage so the 30 odd percent that have mortgages about one in five are overly verged and they will be heading into trouble the good news there is that most of those over leveraged households are high income households so they can weather the storm much better than the poorest canadians but again the thing that is really that poor canadians are staring down right now with the inflation game is the cost of food and theres nothing about this move that is going to lower the cost of rental housing which is insufficient for what is happening in the big cities right now theres just nothing that is expanding supply fast enough in the rental stock market rental housing market and affordability is the name of the game right now because peoples wages are not keeping up with inflation theyre losing ground so theyre spending an awful lot on absolutely the basics housing shelter and gas of which this will help only one thing new people buying into the market not renters um jimmy thanks for the fast work on the microphone i see youre back up and with us uh the the bank of county governor of course saying the goal is to get inflation back to that two percent target uh do you think this will help do that well how do uh 100 but not tomorrow morning it will take anywhere between one two years before we see the full effect of those rate hikes uh slow down the uh demand and inflation we have to remember policy operates with very long and very variable lags so that means for the time being a lot of that is also about a moral suasion exercise to convince people that the bank of canada is on top of this is acting forcefully is ready to surprise even financial markets nobody was really expecting that outcome today and also in a bid to protect and defend their credibility and assert their authority on inflation fighting and this we know in recent conversations this credibility has come under uh intense pressure so i think its uh for all those reasons that we saw this move today i do expect to see more hikes down the road i think theres at least 75 basis point worth of hikes in the next upcoming two meetings that will lead us above the neutral rate but that also means that were going to be 150 basis points above the peak we saw in the cycle of 220 to that ended in 2018 and that was a level that the where the canadian economy couldnt withstand further rate hikes the bank of canada did have the intention to raise it to rise further but it couldnt because of how fast the housing market was slowing right now were expecting even a bigger slowdown in the housing market so i think at one point the bank of canada will be ready to uh to call a pause on this and take stock the only question is whether it will have done too much by then whether it will be too late and that would imply that the economy would head into recession in 2023 i mean i saw you nodding your head a lot throughout that off camera do you want to weigh in first of all i completely agree with jimmy that this is partly a credibility exercise because everybody understands including the governor of the bank of canada that theyre not going to affect the price of food or oil but they need to be seen to do something they have two mandates stabilized prices and stabilize expectations of prices and that is partly the game that they are playing right now for all of our sakes to actually calm people down and say this isnt going to continue galloping ahead with nobody doing anything the other part i will say though even though i said rising interest rates are mostly going to affect mortgage holders and particularly the overly verged mortgage holders who happen to be pretty well healed uh by and large the part of this exercise of raising rates rapidly that you mentioned earlier was that theres going to be a lot of lower paid people working in marginal businesses that are going to be hard hit by higher costs of borrowing they might be on the edge already in just staying afloat after this extraordinary period of pandemic economics of higher costs and lower revenues so people might people who absolutely need to keep their job might be having a tough time keeping their job that is the highest stakes game in this whole story that people are losing their job the gamble is that with record low unemployment rates and roughly just over one unemployed person per one job vacancy maybe it wont be so bad but it is truly a gamble gamblers bargain were past time but i just want to go quickly on one last uh to both of you if you dont mind isnt the truth is a lot of this is is because of outside factors right the war in ukraine uh the supply chain issues and things like that is it is the fact that theres only so much that we can do and count about this anyway uh armeen first to you and then then to jimmy weve done a lot a lot census really of reports showing that it wasnt the central length that saved the day in 2020 it was the federal governments extraordinarily extraordinary generosity in serb payments and emergency recovery payments in child benefits and in seniors benefits when we want to do policy well we can make a difference so there are still stuff that governments can do we are not beholden only to the central bank to do something in fact their playbook is pretty thin and really their playbook is what were seeing they want a cool demand that is kind of their playbook they cool demand by raising prices on everything okay so how do we lower prices weve got other playbooks from history that we can borrow from theres lots more we can be doing but theres going to be a lot of pain for a lot of people as jimmy said for the next year or two we aint seen nothing yet when it comes to food inflation thats going to start biting in um in the fall any last thought to you well yeah i fully agree theres a lot outside the banking of canadas control but i think a lot of this ultimately boils down to covid and as much as wed like to hope that covet is really behind really that inflation is the after effects that were still feeling from covid the co the the supply chain distortions uh the uh the the food price increases the the oil price increases the lack of capacity lack of supply there was the war in ukraine that came on top of that but we already had some pressures even before that so a lot of that has to do with the the supply disruption and i think uh the bank of canada included everybody discovers how inelastic the supply curve is in other words how slow supply is to adjust compared to how fast the mat can be to adjust so were still feeling that so were gonna need the help of those factors ebbing for inflation to really come back to two percent otherwise the bank account is going to have to engineer a very heavy recession all right um jimmy armin thank you for that its a lot to take in but it is what it is right so uh thanks for helping us understand and uh and look toward the future appreciate your time thank you pleasure hi im vashi capellos host of power and politics see more of our show by subscribing to the cbc news channel or click the link for another

process only the strong and the best get to live  their heart song you know what if it was easy to get to world class and extraordinary everyone would be doing it every dream starts off small but you

those things that you want no ones gonna do it for you work on yourself  everyday get better improve learn extend yourself push yourself  out of your comfort zone push the boundaries  that you are accustomed to thats the only way  to grow as a person the reason why you are not become successful the reason why you are not like a locomotive  the reason why youre not having success in your life  is because every single day you got an excuse  and i need you to do me a favour i made my last excuse yesterday my last reason i came up with my last reason yesterday of why i cant do what im supposed to do  and so i need you to do me a huge favor all your excuses all your good reasons everything every everything thats keeping you from doing what youre supposed to do  i need you to put it behind

 listen to me  you gotta hear what im saying  yesterday was the last day that i want to hear an excuse  its over with  recognize  the excuses are not  valid theyre conjured up theyre fabricated theyre lies and how do you stop the lies you stop the lies with the truth you have time you have the skill you have the knowledge and the support and the willpower and the discipline  to get it done what you pay attention to is what you will get and the more attention you get something  the more you feed it the stronger and more powerful that thing grows you need to face master and channel your obsessions

possibilities will take place do i just sit there and settle  no i dont  i say enough is enough man  and im gonna make a change  and im gonna keep going until i get it  you chase something that you believe you deserve  until you get it and it doesnt matter what happens to you  doesnt matter how many times youve been fired doesnt matter how many people dont believe in you  you just go until you get it  thats the point  are you tired yet  some of you need to get tired  you need to be tired of whats going on in your life  get tired of your habits  get tired of the actions that youre putting in every day  you gotta change man or nothing changes  i woke up one day  and stopped making excuses i i woke up one day and stopped playing the blame game  i woke up one day and looked at the man in the mirror and  was like  yo bruh what are you doing  wake up its showtime  lets go how do you rate yourself on a scale of one to ten in terms of your physical appearance in terms of your health  do you take care of yourself  are you allowing yourself to get overweight and out of  shape  are you conscious of your health  are you watching the food that you take into your body  do you make a deliberate effort  to exercise  you know it was george burns he said  we cannot help getting older but we dont have to get old and many of us get old before our time because  we dont take time  to take care of ourselves  your environment is a very good indicator  on a scale of one to ten is it what you want it to be  do you find it desirable are you satisfied  the job or career that youre involved in someone said that 85 of the american public are unhappy with their jobs  are you spending eight hours a day just doing time  doing something that you dont find challenging  that does not make you stretch mentally  that does not stimulate you  that does not inspire you something that you dont find a sense of fulfillment in it  if youre doing that day in and day out  it has to affect how you feel about yourself your level  of motivation  your relationships what kind of impact is that having on your life  is it nourishing or is it a toxic relationship  does it drain you or does it build you up  ask yourself that  how motivated are you to do something about it your contribution your actions  what are you giving  many people will leave the universe without a trace  no one will know they were here  and in fact under their name we could put under there not used up  will anybody know that you came this way  what contribution are you giving  what will you leave what will be different because you came this way  for me its like no brain left behind right because i lived with that identity for so long and my my message to people whether its on stage or in the podcast or anything is that you know we are more than what were demonstrating that weve been sold this lie that people are taught through school like when i do these demos and i i on stage memorize a hundred names and words and  numbers forwards and backwards and i make it appears effortlessly i always tell people i dont do it to impress you i do it to express to you whats really possible because the truth is everyone can do this too and so much more we were taught a lie that somehow our intelligence our potential our learning  our memory somehow is fixed our creativity is fixed our thinking is fixed like our shoe size and what weve discovered as we know more about brain science in the past two decades  weve discovered more than the previous two thousand years and what we know is that were grossly underestimating our own capacity to be able to grow to be able tom contribute  to improve our intelligence and our influence and our impact and im really i want to kind of pull the veil behind and just say hey this is about transcending you know this is about ending the trance ending the trance that were not good enough you know that were not smart enough that were not this genius and im telling the truth and the truth is were faster and were smarter than we think and not just to be able to memorize things but be able to really solve significant challenges and maybe that these challenges that were going through are the lessons that we need to to learn the most now all of us go through struggles right in our health our relationship whatever it is but through struggles come come strengths and people dont talk about this as much and you know i probably have a posttraumatic you know stress from it im going through brain injury after brain injury but theres also posttraumatic growth which which you know like is widely talked about but therere some people that go through immense amount of  trauma and difficulty and challenge but they come out of it actually more empowered they say to themselves that because of going through this i found a new strength  i found my superpowers i found a new meaning in my life i found a new level of commitment i found a strength a mission if you will and a lot of them attest that they wouldnt trade that experience no matter how painful it was at the time for for anything

jdeE2uB0_XM,a realistic day in my life living in nyc vlog,Vlog,this man made me get up on the  toughest day he just said lets do   leg day at six in the morning yeah its rough  today yeah what about getting up this morning   getting up was rough yeah i i told you  i go through cycles where its like   itll be really easy to get up at like 4 45 5 am  crush a workout but ive been in a cycle now where   still get up at what we got up at what five  i got to like 5 15 today yeah i got up right   around 5 am had some coffee hit the gym at six  schedules a little different but still its uh yeah its not fun and its not easy but see what  i mean like put that in the edit like maybe just   yeah right i never thought i would ever ever have  a car in new york city yeah you used to always be   like these people that have cars in the city why  would you ever have a car here i used to not ride   the subway because i wanted to save money on  the multi subway pass id bike everywhere and   now i have a car in the city  its kind of weird but yeah   like driving to the gym in a car is  weird yes biking or walking or whatever my primary motivation for going  into this workout is just to show   up and get it done there are certain  days where the motivation is just not   there and for me that happens when ive been  doing something for a long period of time   i like to see life as buckets so you have you  know your fitness bucket your wellbeing your   friendships right now my fitness bucket is just  on like maintain mode so in my mind getting   any workout is better than no workout and this  morning was just getting in a workout just to move   greatness happens on the days when you show  up even if you dont want to be there one   thing i do know is that i have never regretted  waking up the crack of dawn to get a sweat in so you said before that theo has literally  saved your life what do you mean by that   yeah i mentioned that before in videos that theo  has saved my life and i mean that in the literal   sense of the word not even like a figuratively  but like theo i was getting sober and theo was   uh my reason for getting up in the morning  like you knew you had that responsibility   with owning a dog you couldnt let him down so  yeah theo was the reason one of the main reasons   how i got sober was taking care of theo yeah you  want to keep that in heavy stuff yeah keep it in theo really dictates the morning routine  like ill wake up and get a workout but   then its its theo feeding theo taking him  on his walk i like to walk him for 30 minutes   if i can in the morning maybe even a little  more play with him run with him in the park   go fetch the morning walk with theo is my way  to stay grounded it really is because its every   morning i know a lot of people have dog walkers  i have a dog walker occasionally for when i just   cant make it but i try to walk for you morning  afternoon evening yeah its a good day fdo poops   so it just gives me that sense of  purpose and that sense of grounding   thats what you means to me i guess im a  father in that sense not like a real dad yet so many emails what youre seeing in this video  is not a very glamorous day its very much so a   typical day in the life i mean you saw it its  a huge contrast to like my previous day in the   life videos where it was super glamorized and it  was like a cheesy voice over and it was stuff that   like it was just very social media 2017 whereas  i feel like after the pandemic it just everyone   showed up so bad where its like okay lets just  see something real okay phone phone you really   cant tell much from social media what my day  to day is like and thats what i wanted to make   this video about because i am going through one  of the most difficult for me periods in my life   as far as growing and kind of just pushing my  level of being comfortable and theres a quote   that goes discomfort is the admissions ticket  for a meaningful life and right now i am i am so   uncomfortable but in like the best way where i i  have to grow i got very comfortable doing youtube   school i get nervous going to school like you saw  how nervous i got in the apartment yeah yeah but   like yeah and if youre prepared then you dont  really have anything to be nervous about and like   im fairly prepared for today im doing something  now that ive wanted to do since i was like   10 years old like a kid like very very young i was  20 24 23 when i moved here im 32 now so it goes   fast so if you want to do something you got to do  it im in the middle of a twoyear conservatory   training program its 40 hours a week and it is  using a completely different muscle of the brain   and the heart and the gut that ive ever used  before and its its been a lot and even just the   the location im studying out in brooklyn which  is super industrial looks like in the great gatsby   when theyre driving to manhattan and theyre  going through like the soot and the smoke and   all the industry its just a very its a very good  environment to show up and just put in the work   theres lots of neuroplasticity happening with  the type of training im doing in brooklyn   but more on that to come typically in these days  i get them class i rush home try to make some food and eat something at home versus going  out and ordering takeout and all that   uh spending time with the dog and then its  switching gears its going from something   where in class its a very just real and authentic  and truthful pursuit and youtube i found has been   i mean this is the honest truth  sometimes its very just surface level   4 300 square feet three bedroom three and a half  bathroom 10 rooms just under 17 million dollars   yeah switching gears here now so its after  class and todays one of those days where uh   im in youtuber mode and by youtube remote  i mean like property tour mode so i love   real estate i love architecture and design but  sometimes the home tours get very just bland   you know not to say the real estate videos  are not truthful theyre just much much more   fabricated where im more of like a host than  myself i definitely get creative fulfillment   for making the the real estate tours because  im directing them im producing them scripting   them sometimes editing them nowadays i dont  film them anymore but its not satiating that   creative need that ive in class im harboring  something much deeper and much more richer and   live with an emotional life and youtube im  trying to figure out how to make these videos   i dont know just more more yeah yeah more  more eric connor i feel like a lot of people   dont actually know like who i am and what im  about so hopefully this video helps a little bit at the end of the day my goto thing to just  kind of shed away all the stress of the day   is to go down to the hudson river and just  stare at the water and stare at the skyline   just to go down there and usually be alone theres  not many people especially this time of year its   a little cold but just look at the city and kind  of reflect on the day and just uh you know fill my   bucket up new york city is new york city its such  a vibrant place and i think people who live here   you can get very complacent and be like oh its  just new york but its freaking new york city   like look at that view i think as humans we  are really really good at normalizing things   that social process which our ideas  and those actions even where we live   they can be seen as quite normal and they can be  taken for granted in everyday life and this view   reminds me of that that im in new york city and  i cannot take that for granted and hopefully this   video was a better look at what a an actual day  is like for me living in new york city in 2022   if you like this video leave a comment down  below what else you want to see on this channel   i hope youre well watching this video and  with that i will see you in the next episode

7-5uaPPCjBE,january 6 evidence focuses on former president donald trump,News,this morning the committee investigating the january sixth attack on the capitol suggests former president trump may have tried to influence witness testimony after calling a witness not yet seen at the hearings that person declined to answer or respond to president trumps call and instead alerted their lawyer to the call their lawyer alerted us and this committee has supplied that information to the department of justice the disclosure at the end of yesterdays hearing is not the first time the committee has raised concern about witnesses being contacted by trumps team its unclear what if anything the justice department will do with the committees referral before doj would take any action it would need to know a great deal more for example did president trump know this person had been called to be a witness and exactly what was the context of that call the committee heard testimony yesterday from former white house counsel pat sipoloni who described a quote unhinged meeting at the white house on december 18 involving a group of outside advisers to the president looking to challenge the 2020 election results among them retired general michael flynn and lawyers rudy giuliani and sydney powell who wanted trump to issue an order to seize voting machines simpoloni says he raced to the oval office when he found out about the meeting the federal government seized voting machines its a terrible idea for the country thats not how we do things in the united states when the meeting finished trump tweeted his supporters calling on them to come to washington on january 6 saying it will be wild steven ayers an ohio man who pleaded guilty to participating in the riot testified that that tweet from trump inspired him to travel to washington basically you know the president got everybody riled up ayers said he only left the capitol after trump posted a video telling rioters to leave we literally left right after that come out if he would have done that earlier in the day 1 30 i you know you know we wouldnt be in this maybe wouldnt be in this bad of a situation the committee also showed a drafted tweet not sent by trump which called on his supporters to quote march to the capitol on january 6 committee members claim it shows the attack was premeditated legal experts say the evidence revealed by the committee may show that trump inspired the attack but its likely not enough to bring charges unless a direct link can be shown between trump and the extremist groups that storm the capitol while some of his rhetoric that morning was clearly inflammatory he also used the word peacefully when he spoke during the rally which is a legal matter is very important the committees next public hearing is next thursday in prime time hi everyone george stephanopoulos here thanks for checking out the abc news youtube channel if youd like to get more videos show highlights and watch live event coverage click on the right over here to subscribe to our channel and dont forget to download the abc news app for breaking news alerts thanks for watching

families of the victims during this devastating time on a day that we came together to celebrate community and freedom were instead mourning the loss the tragic loss of life and struggling with the terror that was brought upon us well weve all felt the burden of this terrible act i want to pause and thank the first responders who ran towards the danger to render aid during this active shooter

qrmW96pkc_I,ukraine war zelenskyy praises western artillery  dw news,News,civilian evacuations are underway in ukraines donetsk region with russia stepping up its attacks since claiming full control of neighboring luhansk the city of slovansk has become a main target for shelling but towns across ukraines east are being bombarded missiles struck kharhiv on wednesday destroying a university ukrainian forces have dug in with new defensive lines and president voladimir zelensky said western supplied weapons were finally making a difference on the battlefield well for more im joined by dw correspondent nick spicer whos standing by for us in kiev good to see you nick now the russian offensive in the donbass is grinding on what is the latest news you can bring us well weve had a tactical retreat that you were just explaining earlier where the ukrainian troops who had been defending uh for weeks whereas we thought it would be a matter of days we kept hearing its going to fall tomorrow and they held out for a long time uh evacuated preventing another sort of mario paul situation where the soldiers are taken prisoner and you know brought to russia and so on and theyre now taking up those defensive positions you were referring to in the donetsk region which is the region that vladimir putin needs to take in order to control the entire donbass which he says is the next objective he said that earlier uh this week however theyre dug in really deeply and theyve also managed to evade being caught in the cauldron that the germans pardon me the russians were talking about catching them within so taking up positions in slovenians because you were saying preparing to defend that city but also cram a taurus which is a critical uh transport and rail hub so awaiting the sort of onslaught which will come as per usual via massive artillery barrages and then at some point if the russians are so inclined at street by street fighting when they feel comfortable and safe enough to do that now nick president zelinskis address overnight said that uh heavy weapons from western allies have finally begun working at full capacity did he give any indication of how this would actually help in the war yeah i would say there those that are there are working at full capacity but its very uh were very far from being at the full uh you know wish list what ukrainians want one example there are four american highmars systems which are these precise precision guided missile systems ukrainians want 300 of them what they can do however is fire rockets uh into russian uh occupied territory within one meter accuracy the ukrainian rockets and russian rockets up till now have 500 meters accuracy so you can pinpoint something very precisely and what zylenski said in his speech was that they were going after no surprise here depots of ammunition because the uh or ukrainians are massively outgoing 15 10 to one when it comes to artillery shells going one way or the other so the logical thing is just to take out those stalks of ammunition and thats what the ukrainians say theyre doing as well as command and control centers sort of cut the head off the snake and make it harder for the russians to control their troops and thats been a consistent problem for them throughout this campaign nick spicer in kiev thank you well with ukraines eastern province of luhansk now under russian control moscow has been stepping up its offensive in neighboring donetsk together they make up the donbass which russia wants to seize completely so lets take a look at this map now this is the territory that russia has now taken in ukraine it includes the city as you can see there of chansk which was the last bastion of ukrainian resistance in the luhansk region now analysts say the battle for slavyansk down here is the next key contest in the struggle for the donbass and experts also believe that russian forces are attempting to advance west from lisi chance to the town of siversk and they suggest that russia is likely to try to push towards bachmut from the south well lets bring in a military analyst um and also former british army officer mike martin uh good to see you and thanks for joining us here on dw um so president zielanski says the heavy weapons from ukraines western allies are working at full capacity how much of a concern is this though for the russian forces i i think it does make a difference particularly the longerrange artillery that your correspondent cited in the earlier reports what that allows the ukrainians to do is to do whats called counterbattery fire so targeting russian artillery and that means that the russian artillery uh has to move and the more it has to move between firing the less effective it is as well your correspondence cited that with the longer range and some of the high mars can go up to 450 kilometers so thats obviously a very long way they can use that to target a supply deposit ammunition depots and weve seen a number of russian depots uh being blown up or targeted by artillery over the last week two weeks now mike russian president vladimir putin has declared victory for russian forces in luhansk and the focus um has shifted to slavyansk and thats according to british intelligence is it a matter of time before the entire donbass falls to russia or is that looking a little bit less likely now considering this uh information that weve just been talking about i think its an open question as to whether the russians will be able to control the whole of the donbass your viewers will probably have seen recently that yesterday president putin announced an operational pause and this is basically a cessation of military activities so that they can regroup and whilst it is normal you wouldnt do it unless you had to which tells us that the russians have experienced either lots of casualties lots of battle damage to their equipment or they are running low on supplies so i think it is possible that the russians will take uh the whole of the donbass but in in a sense if you zoom out to the strategic picture the question is how much does that really matter because the ukrainians are also pushing forward in the north and in the south now mike is it possible that the kremlin is preparing for a protracted war with the intention of taking much larger portions of ukraine that is possible um but they are going to need to do a couple of things in order to do that the first is to put their economy on a on a war footing much like uh you know the countries of europe did in the second world war for example and we have seen some slow moves towards that obviously with the sanctions theyve been having problems getting specific components so they have been looking at how they can get around that but more than that they would need to do a mobilization of personnel if we look at russian losses okay estimates are very hard to verify precisely but theyre either up to 35 000 or more likely to be about 20 000 russian losses um replacing those is going to be very very difficult without announcing a general mobilization of the russian population which of course president putin doesnt want to do because this is not a war its only a special military operation so it will be difficult for them to do that military analyst mike martin thank you thank you well ukraines odessa was once one of the liveliest cities on the black sea but its port is closed unable to ship wheat to the world and anyone planning to go for a swim should think again dw correspondent emmanuel chas visited the city and her report was filmed under conditions set out by the ukrainian military were here in the port city of odessa southern ukraine usually at this time of the year the city will be full with tourists they would sun baths on the beach except this year a lot of beaches are mined the ukrainian armed forces planted mines on the beaches to stop the russians landing of course we do not name or show which sections of the coast are mined we have geographical features that are favorable for landing of troops so if that happens we have prepared a few surprises lets say were not allowed to fail more than this our ukrainian military minders say anything identifiable might help the russians locals still come to the beach theyre stressed by air raid alarms and the absence of tourists every year come to us many many million people and they say its a beautiful city near the sea near the black sea but now we dont have this its uncomfortable it was nice when we could go to the sea where would i go we were born and raised here and deceased everything for us but in a current situation we have to be prepared to make sacrifices for victory for our future we can breathe any fresh air but sadly we cant get to the sea anymore and in the town locals might stroll the streets but shops and restaurants are empty music germany france and even from the usa people who worked here especially the women left the country in the first week of the war we kept the restaurants open to provide food for those who needed it when or if odessans come home they will find a city in need of revival

7CZjh-LPPiI,i lost 2pac number so biggie took me to his hotel room he ditched a member of swv for me part 1,Art,music all right here we go desiree smith for the people that dont know you that didnt hear the phone interview that we did three years ago let the people know who you are okay well my name is desiree smith and i was uh in an on and off relationship for about three years with tupac and um you know i was there for some of the pivoting moments in his life i met him right before strictly from my    came out and poetic justice so he was kind of unknown at the time and i got to spend a part of his life in my life with him um up until maybe a couple months before he passed away okay okay okay so with that being said man um lets start it from the beginning how did you meet you pug okay so um i had just broken up with a boyfriend i was feeling down and my best friend at the time called me and was like we want you know were going to the club tonight and i was like i dont really feel like going to the club you know she was like no youre not going to sit in this house and be depressed get dressed were going out so reluctantly i went and it wound up being one of the craziest nights ever at that particular club because um they werent scheduled to be there but big was there park was there and bobby brown was there they asked them to i think flex was a dj back then this was a club called the muse in the meatpacking district now as its called and um so we went and funk flex asked them to come up on the stage bobby brown and park perform then big and pop performed so my friend was excited because she was a big fan of new addition and bobby brown and she grabbed me by my wrist dragged me from one side of the stage to the other side of the stage and as we made our way through that crowd they was going crazy they came off and we got caught in like a bum rush of about i want to say 20 dudes so you got bigs crew whoever was with pock bobby brown i think he to be honest was probably there with a bodyguard and thats it and um she never did get to meet bobby brown now but pop came down and he ran right into me and her and he heard her say i guess she was trying to say to bobby brown where you going without me and he looked at her and was like whoa really so he grabbed her wrist he grabbed my wrist and were facing him we got pushed out of the club like basically backwards but it was so congested that we didnt fall we just you know were moving slowly backwards um there were some sparks that flew some looks between me and him um i didnt know who he was i did not know the song i just knew he was handsome his eyes were magnetic they were making my knees weak and when we got outside um he let go of her hand and he just zoned in on me and started talking to me and uh that was how we first met he invited me to hang out if i was doing anything if i wanted to go have some drinks smoke just chill and um i took a chance and i i felt like it felt right and i was like you know what yeah but it wasnt just me and him it was big big had a friend a female friend with him he invited my girlfriend she declined of course and thats when i told you like you know he was like oh she think her    is platinum and she was like yup and he was like all right go home and polish your platinum and he was like im gonna go home with this gold one though and i was laughing like oh my god hes funny hes handsome hes you know um yeah i remember that like it was yesterday so you know we went we hung out drank smoked smoked some good ass weed so how did you and tupac get back in contact after that night because biggie he was the one that ended up giving you his number and yes this was the pagers date uh back then it was pagers then two ways and um you know i lost my pager and i could have cried because i was so excited and you know um i really wanted to see him again and i was like oh my god im probably never going to see him he lives in california you know hes probably touring doing all this stuff i still public justice still didnt come out i think juice had just came up so i was kind of like okay getting to see who this guy is a little bit and um one night same girlfriend that was my road dog um we decided we were gonna go to a club in union square and as were walking in the club its big is there and i didnt you know know who he was i didnt remember him per se he remembered me though and he was like aint you the girl that uh you know tupac whatever and hes like hes like did you call him and im like no no he asked have he called you and i was like i lost my beeper so i didnt have his number he beat me from you know his beeper number in my beeper and uh i told him i said i lost my beeper i lost contact with him and he was like well hes in new york and i know he would want to see you and i was like really okay so he was like do not leave this club without talking to me so me and my girlfriend went partying im like oh    im thinking like parks gonna show up im not knowing whats going on at the time but before the end of the night big came and got us and was like im gonna take you to him now were like all right you know now shes like all right ill go with you you know because im not gonna let you like leave you know whatever but he was like im gonna take you to his hotel so we go to the hotel and he was probably sleeping i dont know what he was doing but i know big didnt talk to him that night because he didnt know i was there and but it was late its four oclock in the morning already so whatever you know we went to uh one of the rooms and thats i think dave hollister was there because the next day they did mtv unplugged so theyre in that room they they got a little drinks theyre playing cards theyre talking    so you know were like all right cool whatever you know bigs there hanging out at a certain like it gets to be like six so yeah we probably got there like 4 30 ish so now its like 6 30 and theres a knock on the door and theyre like go get the door i open the door that mans mouth fell to the floor like what hes like what are you doing here like you like that like and im like nah big was like nah bro to see you and he was like oh    so you know he told me that they was getting ready they had a taping and that everybody had to you know he was coming to wake everybody up tell them they got to get themselves together so they could go down and shoot the um i guess do their press tour and then do mtv so he told me he would be done he you know he checked with his manager for the itinerary and he said he would be done by a certain time i cant remember 25 years ago of course and he told me to meet him back at the hotel that night that we would hang you know he was gonna actually he told me come meet him were gonna go out so i was like okay ran home showered beauty salon got my hair done uh went shopping picked out an outfit and i came back at that time that was the hemsley hotel um and i met him there that evening and when i got to the his hotel room i will never forget because one of the girls from swb was in there and she seemed like she was kind of flirting but when i walked in that room and he seen me it was like all right well its been real and he was like come on baby lets go and um we ended up uh we went to his room for a little while we smoked we drank we was talking hes kicking it and hes like you know he wanted to run down to the palladium which no not too far away so we got dressed we are you know we went um to the palladium that night i remember this is kind of like when wu tang first first came out so like i remember there was a couple of them there i remember method man most of all and you know so you know that was kind of cool a little tipsy so but that was a really cool experience to go to the club with him because that wasnt normally as we progressed that wasnt something that we normally did you know he wasnt the bring a female to the club type of guy so i i was you know that was a nice experience that i got to have with him that night so what are some of the stuff yall did because you said that he wasnt the type to take you to the club so what is some of the stuff yall did for hobbies when tupac was in new york chilling with you well when he was in new york he was here specifically for work so when he did go out and i think you know the scene back then in new york it was a little you know you you go out with the homies or he started hanging out with certain people from new york city so one thing i know he never brought me around those elements but we would like get stuff to eat you know um when he was staying at the royalton wed be downstairs they had a lobby bar they had a restaurant um one time like it was flooded with like his family some people like psych his um his cousins female cousin mo you know um i forgot what her brothers name is but i didnt really i met him only that one time um so that night we were all in the lobby hanging out drinking talking not smoking but you know it was like a vibe down there and i would say when we went to atlanta well when i visited him in atlanta or he brought me that we went to the movies like just regular stuff you know

baby gets cut in half and thats all there is to it this is your og right here some people put grilled onions peppers stuff like that but you dont need none of that stuff if you just do it right itll be a couple simple ingredients youre going to love it chopped cheese  and its one of those hidden gems of new york you know if you know about it you know about it if you dont then you have to know about it you got to figure it out it was originated in harlem and then it just spread out to the bronx so when you get out to like further brooklyn and queens theyre just starting to know about a chopped cheese like recently its becoming you know the wave and im trying to push that forward a lot of people compare it to a philly cheesesteak everybody knows what a philly cheesesteak  no matter where you go you tell people a philly cheesesteak and they know exactly what it is im trying to bring that chopped cheese to that level that pedestal that it deserves to be there you go boss enjoy we are in the bronx right now taking care of a lot of things i usually get up every day around like 545 600 am and you know just try to start the day i was born and raised in new york city born in brooklyn grew up in the bronx when i was younger my mother she owned a bodega and so i grew up in a bodega you know after school would spend time in there doing my homework helping out of course they are the cornerstone of communities theyre open 247 and they have everything you would need from you know toilet paper to something to eat i come from a long line of vendors im essentially thirdgeneration my grandfather owned a food truck you know my mom had a bodega she also had a you know food truck for a little while i started out with a little hot dog cart not many women were out in the streets selling hot dogs and selling soda and so on and it was basically hard work for a woman but i had to earn the respect of others and i did and then as time goes by look what it turned out to be ive had this dream for a long time so i always knew i wanted to do it just didnt know how to execute it and you know the food truck just made sense he came up with this himself he was like mom what do you think mama im going to see if i could do this and i was saying kid youre the only one thats going to keep the memory going this takes a whole family to keep it going like the bodegas your aunt was there your uncle was there we changed shifts all the time there wasnt anything that the bond of family would not help with and keep it going i passed it on to my son like everybody hands their bodegas down to their children so did i work and talk okay you see this is what my son always tells me work and talk we got things to do we got things to do yes my boss i need a small cheese right now okay yes boss yes boss but you know what i always tell him dont forget im your mama plus you hold the knife yeah yeah thats the puerto rican in me new york is like slowly getting modernized and gentrified so i wanted to continue pushing the culture forward but never forgetting where i came from so i wanted to you know emulate that in my truck on wheels i wanted to bring people back so when they come to the truck theyre like wow man i havent  some of the candies that i have on display or for sale that i give to people they like wow i havent seen this since i was a little kid i want people to remember like their childhood and like the older new york so today were at nyu were getting everything ready were going to be opening at the window soon at 1100 they come between their classes and they line up for this you know they message us every week like when you coming back when you coming back thats the lucky part about having a food truck you can visit different neighborhoods visit different boroughs and you know get to reach more people than you would with just a regular restaurant traveling down to nyu where its a bunch of students who you know either came from other states and theyre just in town to study and want to experience new york and i can actually bring that to their front door and that just brings the word of chopped cheese out to other places i love seeing peoples first reactions when they take a bite of my chopped cheese its like  its amazing to see like  man i just live for that stuff like the way they just react and like oh my god this is so good ive never had anything like this im from la so we dont have chopped cheese yeah no i mean i was born in new york originally but i live in maine now so there isnt really any chopped cheeses there so i moved to new york found out what a chopped cheese was and then i found bodega truck and i was like all right got to try that its the best chopped cheese i mean you wouldnt think it like on a truck but it really works before i started the food truck i would do freelance and menu work and photography work and social media management for a ton of restaurants around new york city a lot of these restaurants they struggle with social media they struggle with photography they struggle with menu work and i feel like i have that edge where i can promote my own self and be great at it im always like a hawk on instagram when theyre at nyu so disappointing when theyre not here but yeah whenever they are  like we got to go get a chopped cheese its my third time fourth maybe do you follow them on insta yeah and theyre not here all the time so when they are  ive had my own social media profile for a long time and you know i have around like 60000 followers on there but i started a food truck you know from zero and now ive passed my own personal page you know im at like 70something which is incredible lot of people tagging each other like hey you need to find this truck or you need to follow this truck they post the most amazing food in new york and that just makes me know im doing something right you know when i see those comments and likes perfect chopped cheese bacon is you know  it got to be crispy thats just what it is it just cant be no other way even though im a fan of you know the softertextured bacon  i love that but you know for a chopped cheese you got to have crispy bacon everybody comes and says yo make sure its crispy so you got the good morning hero three down the blocks and an og i got 842 down the block with onion rings right here going to need three ogs and two good mornings okay at times i do feel like ive bit off more than i can chew just because of the  such growth that weve had within less than a year you know a lot of people coming into this before i started the food truck you know id shared my thoughts and  like hey what do you think about this and a lot of people were very negative towards it like hey no i dont think you should do that no you know thank god that i had my girlfriend there behind me you know giving me that extra push like yeah you know i believe in you you can do it come here come here just stand right here you got to hear these things im about to talk very nice about you no youre not a distraction youre fine youre good but you know i want some brownie points so just stand right here and he says i dont help him how dare him the first time shes helped in months im more of the heavy lifting shes more the brains behind the operation like she does the accounting shes more of the business aspect and thats why im lucky to have her because without her you know im telling you this truck would have not happened when were in action and theres 100 people at the window and were like in the thick of it i take the order i pass it to the cook and then it goes to my mom preparing the sandwiches so shell be you know the one to put the lettuce tomatoes the sauces on it making sure that  and angelas the one whos making sure like it goes to the right sandwich were putting them together were wrapping them out were getting these orders done this ticket is done lets go we run like a welloiled machine there you go boss thank you enjoy guys you have a good one ♪♪ i want to leave something behind that i can be remembered by you know because a lot of people they just you know live life and then thats it im

fcY8YHw_sBc,leeds agree deal with barcelona for raphinha player to go for medical,Sport,uh lets go to ellen road shall we uh tim thornton as you can see hopefully weve sorted out the communications right tell us more about this for athena deal as you see at this moment yeah rob uh deal agreed in principle player going out for a medical in spain so hes not completely finalized but hes pretty much there its what we expected its what weve been telling you for most of the day and this is a culmination really of quite a few weeks of work behind the scenes because we know that chelsea were leading the race to sign him that they got very very close to to sorting a deal but this is all about the player the player had set his heart on the move to barcelona and hes been patient hes waited its the reason that rafinha has been in leeds and not out in australia with the rest of the squad because leeds were expecting this deal to progress and it certainly has over the course of the last 48 hours its really accelerated and very very close to completion now but yeah arsenal were the first to show their hand then chelsea that deal looked to be very very close but of course any deal hinges on the player whether the player wants to go to that club and this was a club that uh barcelona that raffinia was very very keen to join so he was prepared to wait his agent is deco a former barcelona player theyve managed to get the deal done to get the finances in place and rafinha heading out to spain to have a medical i have to say his behavior at leeds has been exemplary he was a key part of the the effort to keep leads in the premier league hes done remarkably well for the club 17 goals over two seasons a big fans favorite and i think hell leave with everybodys good wishes but this is his dream move and it looks as though it is about to happen certainly with the player heading out to spain for that medical now music

HJ0Ispb7Wj4,traditional artist tries digital art for the first time,Art,i usually need a ton of different things to create one single painting brushes paints mediums but today ill be switching all of this for a much simpler setup in this video we are not only going to find out what happens if you give a traditional artist digital art tools but also why after this experiment i believe that every artist needs to try their hands at making digital art so clip studio paint reached out to me like you know its cute and all that you can push a bit of paint around with your little brushes but we bet there is no way you can create something digitally well maybe the conversation wasnt exactly like that but when they asked me to sponsor a video and if i wanted to create a digital work of art for them i was immediately all game you know how much i love me a good challenge and since im an absolute amateur when it comes to digital art i thought it would not only be a fun experiment but also a super interesting learning experience for everyone and oh boy did we learn a ton even though ive used clip studio paint and other painting software before to paint over my work in progress paintings or for drawing ive never painted a portrait so the first thing i did was to test out the brushes and paint a couple of studies to find out how everything works and i have to admit this worked out much better than i anticipated after a couple of hours of testing and fooling a bit around i actually already felt confident enough to get started on my painting music music and the way i approached it is actually not that dissimilar to how i would approach a physical painting except for one tiny difference instead of starting with the darkest areas first i started the image by filling parts of the figure with a solid color this is one of the great advantages of digital art because you can paint on top of that base color and only have to add highlights and shadows to it if i did this with physical paint every color i put on top would instantly mix with whats already on the canvas and i would probably be left with a muddy mess i have to say even though clip studio paint looks incredibly intimidating and has a gazillion of different functions if you just want to paint simple pictures with a few brushes and effects you totally can its actually super straightforward and if i can understand it i guarantee you everyone can so since i like to keep things simple i tried to approach this like a regular painting no fancy textures or any adjustment layers or effects i only used a few brushes the eraser tool and some of the blending brushes i generally tend to get overwhelmed with too many options and tools anyway so i was super happy that i could make the whole experience as simple as just using a few brushes and then focusing on the process rather than anything else and to be honest i didnt really need anything else the brushes you can choose from can already do quite a few things some can create canvas textures to emulate a more traditional painting you also have brushes that allow you to mix and blend colors as if you were using wet paint and then you have brushes that allow you to blend and soften areas music since i didnt want to create a digital looking work of art but rather see if i could create something similar to my regular paintings i mostly use the canvas texture brush and i have to say i really like the texture music one thing ive realized about making art digitally is that you have complete control over everything you can have every color you like and use every brush size you want you can even decide if you want your colors to mix or if you want to work in layers and put them on top of each other which believe me for a traditional artist is kind of wild imagine painting with oil paint but before you put down a brush stroke you can decide if you want it to dry instantly or if you want it to stay wet so you can paint into it that would be a complete game changer but with digital art you have that kind of freedom which makes the whole painting process very fast and also very controlled music another thing that i came to appreciate is that unlike painting with traditional media you can take your painting wherever you want and continue working on it this might sound trivial to some digital artists but believe me this concept is completely alien to me having everything you need to work on a piece of art in one single electronic device is very convenient you can just take your painting project with you wherever you want basically and continue working on it and you dont have to worry about any drying times or turning everything into a huge mess because theres paint everywhere but one of the major things that i realized about digital painting is how much you can actually learn from it and how much it can translate into regular painting the thing is working digitally has one major advantage over working traditionally that for some people can really make a huge difference and that is the fact that you cannot do wrong literally everything you do is reversible and you dont have to worry about messing anything up because you can always make a copy and try stuff out or just undo things in terms of motivation stress frustration this makes a huge difference but not only that the fact that you cant mess up also allows you to be more experimental and try stuff out one of the most essential parts of any creative process this is of course easier said than done when working traditionally for many artists without experience the next brush stroke that is going to completely ruin the painting is often just around the corner but with digital art you dont have that problem at all you can try things out experiment create variations of one in the same painting or just enjoy the safety of the undo button and paint away its a fantastic way to learn new things to explore and also adapt a more laidback attitude when it comes to making art which in my book is absolutely essential now i have to say that im probably not using the program to its full potential i mean im pretty sure im not there are many things that i would have liked to do but i just couldnt figure out how to create some effects as i already mentioned when it comes to digital art im a total beginner and amateur but you know what i also think this kind of played out to my advantage in the end because i didnt feel overwhelmed by all the endless options and i could focus on whats really important music another great thing about working digitally came into play when i painted some of the hair strands and some of the details the cool thing is that you can put some of the details on top of your painting without running the risk of ruining anything while painting the hair for example this was especially helpful because i could just try out brush strokes until i found the perfect ones music and one of my absolute favorite features has got to be the timelapse recording clip studio allows you to record a timelapse video of your process that you can then share online or use and study your own progress and how you can improve on it its super useful and its incredibly satisfying to watch i have to say im quite surprised how similar this painting turned out to my regular paintings sure its not perfect and there are a ton of things that i could improve on but hey this is my first digital work of art so what can you expect if you have any tips or tricks for creating art digitally feel free to let me know in the comments down below check out clip studio paint if you want to give it a try yourself you can find a link in the description below and much thanks to them for sponsoring this video i had a blast creating this work of art and yeah stay creative have a wonderful inspiring day and ill see you in the next video friends have a good one

2X5oHpuD510,stop drawing people who smile like maniacs pls  letslearnhowtodraw tutorial art,Art,lets learn how to draw so today im going to be teaching you how to draw teeth because i see way too many people who draw teeth like this they just draw the mouth and then draw a line across the mouth and then make teeth with more lines so instead you first have to notice a few things the first thing to notice is usually you can only see the top row of teeth so when youre drawing teeth you wont really see the bottom row and you also want to leave a little bit of a gap in between the edges of the teeth and the corners of the mouth and the next thing dont just draw a line down the middle of your teeth it doesnt look good instead draw little triangles at the bottom of the teeth which will make the bottom of the teeth look rounded then for the gums add small little triangles at the top only after youve done that can you add a very small shadow in between the teeth if you add too much of a shadow thats when it starts to look weird and now it looks like this so now you can draw people who dont look like theyre straight out of a horror movie
t5zsPtd_Qhs,where will cristiano ronaldo be next season,Sport,right for more on the developing story that cristiano ronaldo could be on his way out of manchester united we can speak to european football expert andy brussell we we do know that ronaldo wants to play champions league football hes certainly not going to get that at manchester united next season but of all the clubs around europe that could potentially afford him which side do you think is favorite to lure him away from old trafford well i think haley we have to look at how his affordability might change i mean whats been clear coming out of his camp since this story first broke that he would be aiming to move on from manchester united after just a single season back is that he would be willing to take a substantial pay cut now of course substantial pay cut and cristiano ronaldo could still work out as unaffordable and will still work out as unaffordable for a lot of different clubs out there i guess the question were finding out in these exploratory talks at the moment and they are exploratory talks of where might be available uh as a reasonable destination so obviously chelsea comes up because todd bowleys not completely shut it down and also um because of the fact that theyre a premier league club and won the biggest premier league clubs i think you have to ask about other ones out there now bayern have said this is completely out of sync with what we want to do they want to go a bit younger and they would be wanting to look for a younger levandoski replacement if indeed theyre gonna look for a levandoski replacement this summer which wasnt initially their preferred choice i think were looking back to italy now so were not just looking at the george mendish connects uh roma but if were really looking for champions league the napoli have been put forward as a potential deal now bearing in mind that they are looking to slim down their wage bill a little bit but they have qualified for the champions league again maybe some sort of compromise would be there though its really interesting when you bear in mind the incredible rivalry that there is between napoli and juventus in current years how that would go down in italian football circles and particularly amongst the fans what about germany what about buying munich because we heard from the ceo oliver khan saying that they arent interested in signing ronaldo but if lewandowski was to leave do you think that could still materialize maybe i still think its unlikely to be perfectly honest i i mean theyve been pretty clear on which way they want to go um clearly they want to go with younger players going forward and of course lewandowski would be the exception to that if they were to stick with him going into next season which is is still their their preferred plan although they have actually named a price albeit a price that barcelona the one place that he really wants to go arent able to afford that price particularly at the moment also bayerns priorities are really strengthening their defense at the moment theyre looking at matas de licht um that may be looking at moving on bonjour pavar as well so its the defense that they and julian nagas men the coach have talked about for months about strengthening going forward now the fact that sadio manet has come in of course hes not a direct replacement for lewandowski if he were to um move on but there are other players who could move into that central spot including serge canavery even though there are still doubts over his future of course i mean what about paris saintgermain obviously psg could you know have the finances would would that be an option at all youd have messi there and ronaldo together and baffy as well be quite a frightening attack wouldnt it well itd be exciting and i think a lot of people would be excited by the prospect but again theyre going in a different direction uh psg are moving away from this style of model haley thats been behind the appointment of of christoph gautier im sure mauricio pochettino is sitting there thinking if theyd have dumped this starled model a couple of years ago i might have had a better chance of having a longterm future at psg but the striker theyre really looking at is gianluca scamaca who will be the future number nine of italy whos already started to break into that team really burly bustling target man but not that sort of star name theyre looking for the right players to take them forward younger players um much like theyve got vitina in to sort of cuddle cover for and play next to marco verratti as well andy thank you very much indeed thank you music you
25Ko3qPTHoA,i tested the most hated art brand in the worldrose art,Art,roseart is the most hated art brand in existence in fact theyre so hated that even though they dont even exist anymore when i was doing research for this video it was easier for me to find people dunking on roseart crayons than it was to find actual information about roseart and i feel like if you are in that group that i am that was born between the late 80s all the way up until the early 2000s we deserve financial compensation for using roseart nobody wanted roseart crayons everybody wanted the 64count crayola crayon set with the sharpener on the back but i feel like as i get older i see things a lot more clearer and it got me thinking were we all just really dramatic kids or was rosar really the bane of our existence so i went ahead and took the initiative and i bought literally so much vintage rose art current day crazy art and of course current day crayola and today im finally gonna answer that ageold question was rose art really as bad as we thought it was so the first rosar item that i tried out were these rose art 10 count markers and these are from the year 2012 and the first thing that i gotta say is that the packaging looks exactly like crayolas except for one key element and thats located right here on the top now if you were a kid growing up literally in the past 30 years you know that the best part of having crayola markers is being able to stack them in a sword and being able to hit your classmates with it that was the whole appeal but the problem with these roseart ones first of all is the fact that you cant do that because they have a notch that prevents it from happening look at this you cant snap them together so already im like uhuh no in the trash they go so to test out the markers i of course tested them against crazy art which is like the modern day version of rose art and of course crayola crayon but let me tell you guys that when i tested them out they pretty much worked almost the exact same as the crayola one like if you look up close it looks pretty much just like the crayola ones just slightly muted but what was really dramatic was whenever i compared them to the crazy art now if you look up close to these its a mess like an actual mess now remember these rose art markers are literally from 2012 a decade old and i just bought these crazy art markers literally last week from walmart and the crazy art markers if you look at the comparisons theyre pretty much all completely dried out the rose art marker quality it is slightly worse quality but only buy like a tiny micro bit if both of them were free i would pick the crayola but if i was on a budget or just wanted to save some money the roseart ones would get the job done fine music now the next item that i tested out from the infamous rose arts was an item that i 1000 percent had like i specifically remember having this one and as much as i loved crayons this one was my art supply of choice back in the day and this of course is rose arts water now this one is straight up all the way from 2009 so it is 12 years old i dont know if theres like a shortage going on or something but i literally could not find the eightcount crayola watercolor literally anywhere nowhere and i searched two different walmarts i searched target dollar tree online well i didnt search that hard online but regardless i couldnt find it anywhere in my town so ultimately i ended up just using this like really janky 16 pack that i have from like years ago its like missing two colors and the paintbrush and the entire case and just compared it to that my very first impression whenever i opened up these rose art watercolor paint thingies is that i was very impressed with this brush and the reason i was so impressed with it is because if you look closely its an actual real watercolor brush like this is something that i would literally use in my paintings and if you compare that to modern days knockoff watercolor this brush is the bane to my existence the bristles are made out of this weird wire the paintbrush itself is completely bendable and then it like breaks and then you have like this wonky little paintbrush even if youre like a toddler or something like i imagine that this paint brush wouldnt do anything for anybody you know what im saying now as far as like the actual swatches of the crayola rosar and crazy art go i was quite taken back because if you look close enough and ill insert a video now the crayola and roseart both of the paints they like did exactly what watercolor is supposed to do which is paint thats broken down by water these are both really really nice and the colors were both very vibrant the paint was breaking down very nice i was very pleasantly surprised up until this point and what actually shocked me was not from the rose art but from the crazy art this paints guys is literally some of the worst paint that ive ever used if you look closely you can see that the paint it doesnt even look like a swatch of watercolor it kind of looks like if i mixed food coloring with like water and flour and like combined it all together and then like rub that concoction on a page crazy art also left like this weird like film texture down whenever it dried down so like if i was to close my eyes i know exactly where i painted because it has like this weird crusty feel to it and another weird thing that i found is that the paint didnt get broken down by water it kind of like kept its form if that makes sense like it was like a layer of watercolor paint and then like the water on top of it was just floating and then whenever i dip my paint brush into it it left like this weird indentation in the paint which ive never seen before and it was almost like i was dipping my paint brush into like mud or something the quality of the rose art watercolor it is just a little bit ever so tacky like it does feel like it has a little bit more like a filler in it that makes it a little bit more like thick instead of like watercolory if that makes sense but other than that its pretty much the exact same quality as crayola in every single way if i had to choose between the two i wouldnt care which one because theyre so similar next up on the list of things that i tested out from roseart of course were colored pencils and these specific rose art pencils are all the way from 2010 so these colored pencils are 11 years old and again not to bring it up but i really do think theres like a crayola shortage or something going on because along with the watercolor i could not find any crayola colored pencils anywhere so ultimately i ended up just using this like really old 24 pack of crayola colored pencils that i have its like and you thought the last one was janky this one is like 10 times worse like the box is like breaking in half and then like and then like the actual colors like half of them are missing and to make it even worse whenever i was testing these out half of these colors arent even crayola theyre literally prismacolor colored pencils so i had to be very tactical when it came to testing out the colored pencils first thing that i noticed about these colored pencils is that they definitely look like a straight up knockoff to the crayola ones like have you ever seen euphoria you know like maddie like her best friend cassie tries to copy her and its just it doesnt work out this is the exact same situation here now i think this one is definitely the underdog of all the art supplies that im testing out today because when i tested these out i was actually taken back if you will because the roseart colored pencils in my opinion as somebody whos worked with plenty of colored pencils just from like testing them out and doing a couple of swatches they actually worked much better than the crayola like its very subtle but you can definitely see it like if you look close enough you can see that the rose art just went down a little bit more smooth you can see that the color is just a little bit more creamier a little less waxier so not only is it creamier and work better but it didnt have any scratches and on top of that i feel like some of the color was even better than the crayola and as far as the crazy art colored pencils go these pencils they were so scratchy it kind of reminded me of like rubbing nails on a chalkboard whenever i was testing these out if you look close enough to the swatches it kind of looks like i got like a needle or something and just like went over it on top of it and like scratched the paper i mean these the crazy art were just so scratchy the quality of the rose art colored pencils coming in as a total surprise to me i i did not expect this to be happening at all the roseart colored pencils they seem to be a little bit better quality i would pick them over crayola music and for the final item that i just know everybody has been absolutely waiting for me to talk about hold on i need to take a second let me just breathe because i have a lot to say with this one i feel like this art supply is so bad that its not even famous its infamous that everybody knows about it and this of course is the one the only drum roll please roseart crayons okay as far as like the roseart crayons go i for sure for sure have used these in the past and i specifically have very very very vivid memories of using this and what i specifically remember about these crayons is the fact that they were so waxy that you couldnt even draw i hated the fact that i couldnt get really detailed with my coloring books because i dont know they would just like smear and break all the time i hated the way they smelled i hated the wrapper around them i mean just all around these crayons from what i remember were just absolutely just atrocious you know what i mean like the whole experience of using roseart crayons it just like made you depressed as a child these are all the way straight from 2006 these are the 24 count rose art crayons first of all we need to do a smell test because i know for sure these are not gonna smell like crayola i just i just know it in my heart like i just i just know it yeah no i dont smell anything but on the other hand we have the crayolas which i mean everybody knows if i say the smell of crayons this is what it oh god ah it smells so good this is what everybody knows oh my god it smells like childhood theres literally no better scent in the world than crayola crayons lets see if the crazy art passes the smell test oh it smells like wet cardboard it smells kind of like dirt on cardboard like that is not a pleasant smell at all now as far as testing out the crayons went first i decided to test out the initial textures of it all and what my findings found is that rose art again is very similar to the crayola i do have to say that i did notice that the formula was a lot more like waxy and so if you look at the swatches i have a couple of areas that are like really dark compared to the rest of the swatch and my theory for that is that i think roseart has a really soft wax to it and the friction of drawing with it i think heats up the wax and then it has this weird buildup that weve all experienced with roseart and then because it was a lot chunkier i noticed that a lot more like pieces of the wax would like get attached to the sides of the paper but unlike a pencil you cant just blow it off because its like wax and so when i was testing out the crayons i had to like flick off the individual rogue crayon pieces but yeah the formula wasnt as horrendous as i remember but what absolutely was horrendous was no shocker the crazy art oh my god like i thought the watercolor and the markers were bad wait till you see the crayons oh my gosh where do i even begin so if you look at the green swatch of the crazy art youll notice that theres like one area where its kind of like missing color and i dont know what happened but as i was swatching like the crayon just like stopped working like i dont know if that makes sense or not but it was like i ran into like an area that was just pure wax that didnt have any color in it and so i was like just rubbing this pure clear wax on to a piece of paper before i put these away oh my god oh god and then the last thing about the crazy art that like really freaked me out that the other two did not have is that the crazy art were really they were like sticky from this point forward i think its pretty clear that the crazy art are just like absolute garbage garbage quality compared to the other two which is saying a lot because were dealing with the most notoriously bad crayon of all time so for the color section i didnt even bother including crazy art just because i feel like it would have wasted everybodys time so i just wanted to do one last comparison between crayola and rose art and i decided to use printer paper for this because its super slippery and as you can see like from afar theyre pretty identical theres nothing really super dramatic from afar at all and something really specifically that i remember about rose art crayons is that you would get like one specific color and as you were coloring there would be like little bits of another color in it and that weird phenomenon of finding different colors in my crayons that happened today you can see that theres like weird bits of blue or black or green i cant really tell but theres like other colors in it oh and apparently the rose art smears because now my hand is all black and the paper is black as well so thats great the rose art crayon quality its obviously worse but now that ive tested out crazy art i feel like crazy art has truly shown me what terrible quality crayon is i feel like on a scale of crayola to crazy art its definitely floating somewhere in the middle so in retrospect i feel like roseart as a whole im just gonna say it now it truly wasnt the worst thing in the world back in like the early 2000s you could get rose art stuff for literally half the price of crayola and just the fact that some of these rose arts art supplies worked almost identical as their counterpart you heard it here first besides the crayons justice for rose art so anyway guys thats my personal opinion on roseart 20 years later this is what i found if you want to see more art reviews ill put a playlist here i recently did a video where i tested out 1200 watercolor dont forget to subscribe like the video i hope that you have the most wonderful day today and with that being said i will see you guys next video bye
owiTLs8Acrc,fantastic amazon beauty  fashion must haves july 2022,Fashion,hello everyone welcome back if this is your first time here my name is risa and today im going to be sharing with you some more of my amazon musthaves music last month when i uploaded a amazon favorites musthaves video i did ask how often you want to see these types of videos and the majority of you said monthly do them monthly and that is very easy to do for me because i order from amazon almost every single day i have been preparing my two sons aged 18 and 20 for a 10day trip to israel theyre leaving in a couple of days and i have placed orders i keep forgetting things and i keep looking at the checklist of things that they need and then i go over to amazon and i order them and i have them quickly and if you would like me to do another amazon travel video ive done one in the past i think maybe two months ago i did an amazon travel favorites im gonna have them travel with these items and give me some feedback on them before i tell you whether or not they were worth the purchase but today we are focusing once again on fashion and beauty from all of the fashion and beauty items i have ordered from amazon since my last video ive chosen 10 that i truly think are worth adding to your cart if theyre your style of course oh before i get into sharing with you the 10 products i dont want to forget to mention that i am uploading this video on amazon prime day obviously or maybe not obviously i am recording this video before prime day so unfortunately i dont know what all of the prime day deals are going to be but in the description box of this video i am going to link some of the products that i know are going to be prime day deals that i personally really like for example i know that the stila stay all day liquid eyeliner is going to be a prime day deal so i will have that linked down below once again in the description box of this video so if you click on that link it will take you to that product and the prime day deal price should be there okay so i just glanced over into the mirror i have sitting here and i noticed these little flyaways that i always get up in front so i think that means i should start with the product that is going to fix this problem which is this hair finishing stick from funan it actually comes in a two pack for just 699 it has four and a half stars with over 1600 reviews the brand frizz ease used to have a very similar product to this one but for some reason they discontinued it i think you may still be able to find them on ebay but you dont need to do that you can just order this two pack from amazon so this looks just like a mascara wand right well what this does is it instantly fixes those flyaways and broken hairs i probably should have shown you the before closer up but this is the after and so here it is at the part line if youre anything like me you just get a ton of these flyaways and broken hairs especially if youre over 40 and your hair is going more gray and getting more wiry this product is amazing you can use it on your hairline over here voila so much better all right moving on to product number two im going to tell you what eyeshadow palette i currently have on my eyes this was another great beauty find this is the la girl beauty brick in the nudes you get 12 shades in this palette nine of which are soft shimmers and three that are matte the packaging is great for travel theres a little mirror inside it did come with a brush i dont know what happened to it i obviously just misplaced it what i really like about the shimmers in this palette is that they arent overly shimmery theres a fine line between a soft shimmer and a bold shimmer that emphasizes texture which is something a lot of us dont want especially if our eyelids have become a lot less taut in recent years these shimmer shadows just give the eyelids a sort of soft gleam and the tones in this palette are really great for someone who prefers neutral to cool eyeshadows versus those really warm eyeshadow palettes that you see a lot of lately okay moving on to brows i happen to catch the live get ready with me of a makeup artist that i follow who lives in nashville i will put her name up on the screen right here she and her friend who is also a makeup artist the two of them were getting ready together could not stop raving about this city color b bold brow soap the two of them were saying that this product is miles better than the anastasia beverly hills brow freeze for a fraction of the price and they were not wrong this is a fantastic brow shaping gel or brow setting gel i am just crazy about this i just purchased also from amazon and i can link those as well a bunch of just disposable mascara wands those spoolies and i bend it and then i stick it in the tube and i brush up my brows and then i wait a minute or two and i go in with either my brow pencil or a brow pen to get those really nice trendy fluffy brows or another way ive been using this is when i use my brow pencil first i go back in with this just to set the brows in place and this brow soap retails for less than twelve dollars currently on amazon up next is this amts glitter lip balm stick in the shade aurora lights this product retails for 1250 although i believe when i got mine it was less the price does seem to fluctuate on this but again this is a product that has almost 5 stars and over 200 reviews now it says that its glittery but it is not there is a slight sheen to it its sort of frosted although i hate to use the term frosted because it takes me back to when i was in junior high in the 80s i wore this absolutely horrible frosted pink lipstick this frosted baby pink lipstick that against the silver of my braces looked absolutely horrendous so i hate to use the word frosted so this is a 2022 frosted not a 1987 frosted look how beautiful this color is ive been wearing it alone or on top of a lipstick or liquid lipstick to give my lips some shine and some hydration and that little bit of frost slash glitter slash sparkle i think makes my lips appear a little fuller it just feels so hydrating and nourishing and it says here that it contains rose hip oil camellia seed oil vitamins a and e and cacao seed butter its nonsticky and you definitely dont feel any glitter particles on your lips im sure like a lot of you a gritty glittery feel on the lips is a no go now finally in the beauty category we have this rosalind boutique gemstone jade roller gouache set this is a twopiece set and it sells for eight dollars and fifty cents i chose this one specifically because it does have over 31 000 reviews close to 32 000 and almost 5 stars now there is a little story behind why i decided to purchase this the other day i was talking to my good friend and fellow youtuber stephanie marie we chat on the marco polo app and i was complaining to her that i was really frustrated with my face my neck my chin this area right here ive always had a little bit of excess skin there but as ive gotten older ive been feeling like its just more and more apparent and someone took a video of me well not someone when i went out for my birthday back in may two other youtubers michelle wong and samantha march were doing vlogs they were vlogging the dinner so they were on either side of me so they were taking video and when they uploaded the video i was oof i was not that happy with how i looked i felt like i just had way too much skin through here and i just felt very selfconscious about it so i actually started researching necklace and procedures that will get rid of this im not going to try kybella or coolsculpting because ive heard horror stories about both but i have heard good things from friends who have gotten slight necklifts or just lower face lifts im not ready to do that just yet even though i will be 50 next year i just dont know if i want to go under the knife so stephanie marie texted me this video and the results that this woman got after just two weeks of using a gua sha tool twice a day i was floored i immediately went to amazon and ordered this i have been using this tool religiously since i got it which was about five days ago i did take a before picture i dont think im ready to take any sort of after picture just yet but i will definitely take one after two weeks to see if i hopefully get the same results that this woman did i will put the link down below in the description box so if you do end up ordering this just follow her video thats what ive been doing and even though i have not taken an after picture yet because i feel like its too soon i do feel like its already helped a little bit i have been using it not only in this area for my jawline but ive also been using it on my cheeks and kind of pushing up my eyelids because i have hooded eyes and i do feel like even after just four ish days maybe its just all in my head but i feel like my face is a little bit lifted so that brings me to the end of the five beauty products ive been loving this month but now i want to move into some fashion beginning with what i currently have on now this is a dress there were definitely some mixed reviews on this one but i am loving it its super comfortable its great for here in vegas where its over 100 degrees almost every single day i love a tie shoulder i think those of you that watch my videos regularly you are well aware that i like anything with ruffles bows ties i dont know maybe its the sevenyearold girl that is still living in me but i really really like a statement shoulder or a tie shoulder i do actually at first i did not like that this has padded cups but its great for those of you that dont want to wear a bra or you dont have to wear any sort of covers in this area the only thing i dont like about this dress is the length on me i shouldnt say i dont like it i dont love the length and i plan on actually getting it shortened as you can see here i just think it looks a little bit better at that length versus what it is right now but im still going to wear it as is before i have the time to go take it to a tailor but its super comfy i think its flattering i love the color so yeah i would highly recommend this dress if this is your style next up is this twopiece set that i know is not going to be for everyone but honestly im just wearing this outfit mostly around the house it makes a great little outfit if you are going to the pool and you want just some easy on pants and easy on tank as a cover up you can also wear a different top with these pants i have personally paired a one shoulder brown tank top that isnt as cropped with those pants and it looked super cute so you dont have to use the matching top if thats not something youre comfortable in the length is good for those of us that are a little bit taller i am five foot seven when it comes to pants and jumpsuits and dresses i always look for reviews from taller people because i want to know if its going to be long enough on me you can always shorten something but you cant always make it longer here is another dress that i have absolutely fallen in love with that again i know is not going to be everyones style if you havent noticed yet my style is extremely feminine and girly and i am in love with the brand love shack fancy well maybe i shouldnt say in love because some of their stuff im not into at all and im especially not into the price point most of their dresses are around three four five hundred dollars which i think is way too much this dress however not even close to that price when i first put it on i thought maybe its a little too young for me maybe im a little bit too busty for it but then i talked myself right out of that because im always preaching that youre never too old to wear anything that you feel good in and i needed to take my own advice now that said i actually did post a video to ticktock wearing this dress asking if i should keep it or return it because i was a little uncertain and the majority of the responses said keep it it is so so cute and i agree im loving it im also loving these wedge shoes i love a good wedge in the summertime this one is super super comfortable it runs true to size its a great height i dont think its too high i wore them running errands yesterday and i was really surprised at how comfortable they actually are they do have four and a half stars with over four thousand reviews you can also get them in this style you can get them in different colors like white or black heres the tan in another style and i think the forty dollars is actually a very reasonable price for this shoe finishing off with two accessories ive actually worn these bracelets and these earrings in other videos before i got around to filming this one ever since i got these which was about 10 12 days ago i have been wearing them nonstop when i did wear these bracelets in another recent video i got quite a few comments asking me about them where did i get them you know theyre not real gold obviously but if you want to get in on the multilayered bracelet trend this is the way to go you get all four of these bracelets for eight dollars need i say more and no they have not turned my arm blue or green and i actually wore them in the pool accidentally even after that they didnt change color they didnt leave my skin once again blue or green i love these and finally we have these earrings im really liking the chain link earring trend and i like it even more when the earrings are only 13 when i first got these in the mail and opened them my jaw dropped i have been so impressed with the jewelry i have been getting from amazon lately these definitely look like earrings that i would go to dillards or macys and pay 80 90 100 for these are only 13 they look and feel way more expensive theyre not heavy though they go with so much you can wear them dressy you can wear them casual i actually thought that maybe they were a little bit too dressy for this dress but you know what i dont care i just love wearing these earrings i think the sparkle on this one link just elevates the whole look and brings a little bit of sparkle to my face all right everyone i really hope you enjoyed seeing my 10 fashion and beauty favorites from amazon this month as i think i mentioned at the

F32I8rGOzco,my art collaboration with nicola russell,Art,my friend nikki had a great idea for an art collaboration we both draw each other in pencil then send the drawing to the other to be painted in our own style i quickly got to sketching on some nice cold press watercolor paper knowing nikki doesnt ink over her pencils like i do i was able to use a number two pencil for darker lines i loved of course drawing the hair concurrently nikki was working on my drawing sorry i didnt have any hair for you to draw nikki i sent my drawing out the next day and a few days later received nikkis drawing of me it was so good and a bonus drawing in the back how cool is that i did my usual inks but i tried to keep as much of nikkis line work as possible ive never done a selfportrait before and i think technically this doesnt count as one right it was weird painting myself really but i loved working over nickis amazing drawing she made me so much more handsome than i am in real life i made sure to give myself a red nose because its only fair i guess and thats me in both nikkis and my style combined what do you think ill tag her below so check out her take on my drawing thanks nikki this was a great idea and so much fun

yeah yeah you really really came through in the squad this year with arsenal obviously i was sweating because you were bagging goals out you went stanford bridge and back too and i was like were scaring them right now because im not gonna lie i i think youve asked me a chance relaxed yeah then you just flipped it and for you obviously being a goal scorer as well there must have been a lot of pressure to go out there and make sure you turned it around and he was at the front of that man how did you deal with that yeah i think its a good pressure though you know i think um as a player you want to play in the big games man like yes youve been dreaming to play in games like that you know against chelsea the big team so i was more excited you know more so than nervous and i think like you said man once you get a good result and a performance in a game like that it kind of gives you the momentum to keep home and i really feel like that was a big turning point in our season you know to really go on the run that we did and also unfortunately we missed out but we go again man so again you go again next season its cool im going to rob you in too much its so good its so good these are steady to be fair more like more casual dunks i think yeah im lacking these colors to be fair its a nice one i havent even seen those ones before this is a nice little color yeah ive got a little

man thats thats towards the the later stages right now i feel like all the youngsters now are all wearing dunks and stuff theyre not really on the air max wave here in the uk yeah no its too much i feel like dang so dunks are coming in fashion man i feel like theyre theyre nice casual trainers but like with style as well you know yeah i like downstairs comfy as well i think thats important in

like hes always gotten fresh beds then whites doing a bit to be fair to be fair we have been white in here yeah i cant lie yeah dont worry mikes doing a bit man that might have got a few who would you say out of the borders its like drippiest yeah for me yeah for you personally obviously benzies like elite man but hes just it just comes with everything just him as a player his whole but if im talking about this style for me right now i think joe would have mine oh joel joes jokes i like the way he does it man its like sometimes its a lot sometimes its not too much so yeah right now i give it to joe man respect that thats what im saying hes keeping it hes keeping it within the academy i see whats going on listen man im not youre not tied in who would you say to the maddies style in the

room why theyre so brutal its just a bands in it though anyone can catch corn everyone but thats whats good man its like you want your environment not to be too serious serious every day in it thats what ill say about the team right now that everyones just like mad relax everyones like a family as well mans house its a good time to be at the club all right so this is the wall where it gets serious certain this is where all the grails are as you can see thats right see its all boxed off man no entry exclusive zone trust me so whats grabbing your eyes on this wall right here were gonna move down there in a sec but like this section right here bottom right these are unions no these are these are for the union four guavas yeah those are fans have you got any of the union for us yet i havent you know seriously havent today might be the day ive got these man the nice on the little yeah the holiday vibe the office one volts yeah um whats your thoughts on the union jordan once those are nice you know i think this color is clean proper properties proper proper clean man drop of a lot of stuff ive got our shoes as well the number 14 a lot of people have been talking about its a big number yeah it comes with a lot of legacy obviously we know on reward what was that like for you getting such a prestigious number man like and how did how did that come about like did you ask for it or is it just something they offer yeah its obviously its a nice feeling and obviously to get a contract secure your future kind of just sort that out and just focus on on playing you know just yeah have focus know that youre here the 14 obviously they told me was available obviously and obviously im speaking on the manager and as a young kid you grow up watching obviously thierry and obviously even other workforce so another obviously what it means to the club and did you say thats mine yeah you know give me that thats like i said any kid man any kid supporting arsenal yeah if you dont want their fault in this there must be something wrong with you man so yeah obviously when the opportunity came i was like why not man i want to do i want to kind of not be them i want to be myself and just create my own kind of memories in the shirt you know and add my own spin them thats exactly what i want to do nothing changes going to keep working its pressure whether youre wearing 14 30 62 so you just keep working man hopefully like i said you can can make some more memories in that show i know youre going to kick on man pains me to say because obviously with the ops so you know its just its not too late to change man its not too late to change change im from tottenham it cant change its just not happening your question whos the better striker whos the best striker when you look at the camera where you say this oh no youre on this answer whos the best striker aubameyang or harry kane oh well hes gonna lie through his teeth right here oh my god youre gonna lie right here and they look after me serious i got their manuals it was a nice job yeah i did i have my own to be fair serious when i went into one of the stores to be fair um you just linked up through obviously the dms and then yeah it just kind of came from there it was just organic was that like uh did you know that youre ghanaian and yeah i think he obviously did obviously and through the football and weve obviously determined what was happening obviously with the black lives matters and stuff like that so it was just a kind of trying to push through this a positive message you know and he did that you know would you she always had to do with his work so i rp him and hes a state of genius oh thats thats the mad thing about virgo you know because its like he always did like his research in the culture whether it was like sport fashion music like he always like really involved himself in it and did his research so i wouldnt be surprised if he actually did find out that he was garnier and was like yo lets make this happen yeah i hear so many stories about him that he does things like that are you are you a gamer yeah i played to be fair you must abandon during lockdown though yeah but do you like that man too crazy crazy awesome was popping pro clubs for crops is our one man wait so who did you who did you have on pro club we need to know this so who in your programs team who was in that team was there any other arsenal players in that team nah they didnt they didnt make their lineup is it for them its not about big names its about quality man the    the older man themselves order mandom what division did you get to we won division one you won division one youre lying play of the play with that are you in there you want that one no they dont like that i dont play down our achievements though i couldnt even get out division four we were struggling mighty i quit some you know what the pro club youve got to be harsh man but the guys are not on it yeah youre not putting it on people just cant even tell you what time were going online man just like that just like that that would be in the whats that group just like messaging like whats going on a whole new whatsapp group bro its get set up man ruthless look on division one man i respect it lets go music before we start speaking about the kicks and stuff kanye what does kanye mean to you a fan or i am too because i watch this documentary yes all of it yeah whats all of it all through how do you feel about it inspirational man probably amazing i think his mindset some people obviously might see it in a different asset as a mindset someone that believed in himself and i was gonna gonna do it no matter what anyone said so for me thats inspiring and obviously what he went on to do in the fashion game as well was crazy insane the impact hes had on culture interesting thing as well was the relationship he had with his mom in it yeah yeah his mom was like hes like g like proper g put the battery in his back and made him like have that confidence no its true man how proud are you i know it sounds like a cliche question but how proud are they with you man because obviously like i dont know if you look at the odds to be a footballer just professional in general it is like slim but then to be like playing for a premier league club slimmer and then to be playing for like top six club its like even slimmer easy but obviously its awesome is a massive club you know that that they must be super proud nah they are man its good to have them around man because even when youre having down days they always remind you that where you came from you know yeah from detroit you know not many people make it out there to to play in a premier league you know let alone pay for awesome so they remind me every day to never be you know im grateful for where you come from and always be grateful to god you know for where you are and just to keep going you know because the journeys not finished man so hopefully you can continue to have many good times together man and the key to making them proud man thats the a minute 700 the seven hundreds are our classics one see the wave runner thats like the og og colorway yeah then you just need them in the collection you need them a minute i might have to ill be honest theyre like the only ones i wear yeah i got i got like six pairs of ideas these man a bit more comfy these look comfy man nice colorway slides have you got any slides yeah ive got these this color got this color what are you saying on them boss them on holiday yeah its nice but miami yeah they made the cards still they made the cut they really look cute what are you saying on the phone runners though because these are like marmite thats not really for me my cousin had them too far he he dripped them well man but yeah i dont really think my big toe would be too comfortable in there man but this is what i want to ask you as well obviously you know that jay zeus around town yeah you dont got a similar celebration so whats going on are you not going to end up doing it together if youre playing together already its going to be like these are just going to be like here like together it was like who had the other one when they did it it was it was a bam young and someone else lacquered this thing yeah that one that hold this man yeah look at that link up there im not gonna do it im not gonna do a review ill do this one ill probably come with that celebration coldest man how you feeling about next season man like i think its exciting times man i think its a its a great time to be an arsenal player arsenal fan i think weve got a nice young squad everyones going to grow together and yeah were hungry man were hungry you know we just missed out last year so we all want to you know want to rectify that and make it for the fans you know the fans have supported us i think the connection with the fans the atmosphere created at the endless last season was amazing so hopefully we can you can get that again this season and really get the results and get back into the champions league man even i dont know where that came from no its been electric man especially last last in that back end of the run manual do you think its anything to do with maybe like i dont know arsenal fan tv that kind of i dont know about that i just know the emerald i dont know if youre really popping like that and now i never studied and its like everythings in sync listen i just know the emirates is popping off man its the place to be thats it i just asked what i love all right cool basketball quickly as well world cup this year obviously youve got the 14 i mean are you gonna is that in your mind are you going to maybe stake a claim if you can get into that squad lets see man obviously at the moment i havent made a decision on my international future so right now im just just trying to focus on the club football you know at the moment i was just sorting out my situation and obviously sit down with my family the team and see what possibilities are there you know what made the right decision after that so anything youre urging towards out of the nation right now neutral man focusing on a good preseason and anything no no no no fish in here man yeah yeah good you got everything you wanted im happy man were good youre saying sweet and your total is music i love the chick game man packing me up showing me love ill be back man bless music you
-DUWTteit-0,im shocked how well this worked,Tech, portable gaming systems like the valve steam deck offer an unprecedented amount of pc gaming goodness in a handheld form factor but with great performance comes great heat and great fan noise now valve has addressed this to a significant degree pun intended by altering the fan curves of the steam deck to achieve a better balance between noise and thermal management but theres a limit to how much you can do by simply tuning how quickly your fan is spinning the laws of physics cant be broken well you know what i say i say beep physics were gonna do it hot rod style with this m2 cooler this block of aluminum about a hundred thousand dollars worth of solidworks licenses and of course this is it this is all weve got  well we also have a tormach its a pretty big shop  were gonna have some fun fun telling you about our sponsor pdq take patch management off your plate by automating it with pdq you can keep your machines patched and up to date automatically giving you time to do more important things like watching linus tech tips start your free trial at pdqcomlinus upbeat music the genesis of this video was actually a conversation with aya about the upcoming neo 2 because its much smaller more compact than the steam deck but it actually has a similar thermal envelope for the soc and i expressed concern knowing what i knew about the better managed but certainly audible fan on the steam deck that if you gotta remove that heat you gotta do it somehow and i was like dude you know what would be super cool if you just had a strap on cooler remember those little water coolers that you can just dunk ice into a reservoir and then loop onto the back of your phone  oh yeah  well apparently enough people are buying those that its an entire freaking product category so it really doesnt seem that farfetched to have a strap on extra cooling module for your handheld gaming pc  ah  and i think that with alexs skills we could actually do it in a way that is pretty darn user friendly  so today im making your strap on  yes yes lets do it the idea then is to repurpose another cooler like this hr09 m2 cooler from thermalright to add supplemental cooling to the soc and we believe the steam deck is a perfect candidate for this because with relative ease we can jury rig a mounting mechanism and cut a hole in the back of it thatll let it just hot rod out the back  should be easy  of course to determine whether our modification achieves the desired results were gonna need to take some baseline readings now we cant rely on performance for this because i think alex and i are in agreement that it will probably be identical after the fact  yeah  these systems are generally power limited more so than they are thermally limited but what we can see is in a demanding game like horizon zero dawn our cpu and gpu are sitting in the 82 to 84 degree range and our system fan is noticeably audible those are two things wed like to address also alex our fan rpm is around 5700  alex oh thats pretty high  yeah ill be really interested to see if we can lower that thats a way that we can empirically measure how much quieter weve made it even though we dont have an acoustic chamber yet  yeah the tormach being on is louder than this but its a cnc mill  if i was sitting gaming i would definitely notice this  yeah  step one then shut down the steam deck  yep take it apart  perhaps for the last time  well its gonna survive this its gonna be fine  you know how mad people are gonna be if we ruin a steam deck these things are rarer than hens teeth  itll be fine  this explicitly says no thermal testing thats only because weve disassembled it before its fine to thermally test this against itself with a different cooler on it just wanna point that out what a nerd dan signed the inside of this one from when he opened it up to fix it laugh also really dan or is this from you  well thats from me but it came with not all the screws in it from dan  whats next then  this is about the shape that im thinking or i thing will be it kind of interferes with our wifi card that might be a problem  which thing oh youre gonna do a big heat spreader  well we need this to attach to something that can attach to the mounting holes  got it so we need a midplate  yeah  understood hey i couldnt help noticing this emi shield also seems to be acting as a heat spreader of some sort for the vrms have we accounted for that  oh yeah were just gonna cover this thing in thermal pads instead of those thermal pads we could use  dont say it i dont want no  we could just coat this entire thing in k5 pro  ooh we are not doing that do you know how long it took me to clean that graphics card  but think about how great for one our thermals would be and two it would be so easy to put on and also  brandon so easy to put on  yeah  okay enough alex laughs  oh i learned this really cool tip recently if you want the center to center distance between two holes that are the same size come in measure the one hole zero it and then you can measure to the outside of each hole  linus oh thats cool and then its just subtracted  alex yeah  linus essentially it cancels out  so we have 19  cool you turned on the fume extractor  yeah just for sanity were going to laser cut out a little thing here make sure everything lines up doesnt interfere  got it  and then we can check her on the mill if it looks good  nice  brandon be fast well miss it  brandon what  linus hes firing the laser good job alex  alex yay  linus woo a lot of people might have used scissors to cut paper  if you use scissors to cut paper what are you even doing  some kind of caveman what  yeah whats the repeatability of your scissor cutting my lasers under a thao so maybe we want to scooch it that way just a tiny bit more but that seems pretty good  yeah that seems fricking awesome i mean honestly i dont even think you need to  we might as well its just cheap insurance its very easy  were good were good to go were ready to go  im moving at 03 of an inch  were ready were ready give me the aluminum im cutting it okay i need your help  you dont even put that piece of aluminum in there you need to cut it first  okay what do i do then  you can cut a hole in the back of this  can we just laser that  no this is i believe abs its a thermoplastic so instead of cutting it just melts and then catches on fire and its a pretty bad time  routing it  we could but then i have to program the rotor and we have to strap this down whereas handing you a dremel takes very little time  but the results alex think of the results  oh you have a template  linus how are we gonna figure out exactly where the template goes  yeah its gonna be hard one way we can do it is this hole right here lines up with that  linus so it does itll be close  yeah  itll be pretty close okay i can handle that  oh and we also have these beautiful new bits come over here  oh really  you know we have this dremel screw that thing dremels suck look  what since when did dremel suck i thought we loved dremel wait what are these how much did i pay for this  alex oh like 90 bucks  huh theyre kind of beautiful i know  okay what do they do  alex well its like  whoa that sound  you can use it with the die grinder its like a dremel but with balls  huh motor wiring laughs where would i find two skinny sticks or skinny rods dowel pin assortment alloy steel yeah this could work yeah this will do now this is in placeish  to turn this piece of aluminum into a functional part we need to cut it on the tormach first thing though i need to do a bunch of temp if everything goes well it should look something like this and that should take us about 11 minutes  fun thing while you were figuring out if we can i actually ran a little experiment to determine if we should check this out are your plugs in yet  nope  okay keep them out watch this okay see the gpu temps  yeah around 80 78 right now but yeah  okay listen to the fan watch this im gonna take this heat pipe and attach it to this thermal pad  oh wow  its totally gonna work  it just completely dropped yeah its already 10 degrees cooler oh my god  this is actually worth doing alex laughs  i just assumed it wouldnt be honestly  this is gonna be freaking awesome how much more exciting is this project now that we know its gonna totally kick ass  its honestly a lot more exciting i thought it was gonna be just stupid  this guy always doubts me metals grinding thats not hot  no  oh okay cool now it appears that im lining this up by hand but im actually not i have marked this one and then what im gonna do is im gonna put little scratch marks on for these other two im gonna drill out these holes then i can validate that theyre all in the right spots before i make the complete cutout cause im actually gonna cut out this entire shape all right no turning back now theres officially extra holes in this steam deck now we just take this pop it back on here and see if we managed to line up all those holes what would you say if i told you i absolutely fricking nailed this  alex id be pretty impressed  holy crap did i have this on alex laughs  brandon linus  oh wait no no its fine i only have the backing over there sorry brain part brain part mostly now that i know where the holes are supposed to be i can know exactly where my template needs to be and i can mark it and cut it out  oh this things such a beautiful machine just biggest shout out to tormach once again drill wiring  brandon it is really cool that it can just change that  oh yeah its so sick drill wiring all right looks good just need to flip her over chop off the bottom and ready to test fit if this works oh it works perfectly good but it just barely hits our wifi module its like 30 seconds on the belt sander too get rid of that very easy the more difficult thing though you might notice our studs arent quite long enough  oh  theres two ways we can go about this we can either remove a bit of material from here like five hundredths of an inch or so or we have little chumies so we could just chop these at a good height put that on top and have the whole thing just be higher  oh i think we should just shave this down  yeah thats what i think as well  yeah lets do that man weve got a lot of thickness here i think we should take this down to half of the overall thickness  okay  thats my vibe just make it lower profile cause thats gonna take weight off of it too which would be nice  and also if we take it off from the bottom here we might get tiny bit better performance would you think  yeah and then i in the meantime im gonna finally actually cut out the back of this steam deck  one thing thats awesome about the tormach is that we get conversational programming so instead of taking all the time to make something in solidworks program it export the g code you can just do it right in here and tell it like i want to face something off 500 thousandths of an inch and boom it does it metal grinding  im sorry alex i dont like the clamp you only live once metal grinding hey alex  alex yeah  you would use those deburring things at this stage now then right  at that stage youre so close id probably just use a file  oh all right okay this roided out dremel is amazing im deburringtaking off a little bit of material that i missed before just listen to it motor wiring laughs here it is my perfect dremel job you ready well okay perfect is a strong word but here it is  alex okay good though  here it is my not bad dremel job  alex yeah not bad at all  hi there metal grinding it should fit now if we both executed perfectly this will fit immediately  yep  what are the odds  high very high i believe in us alex laughs  im sorry are you taking the piss  do you think that you did a good job  yes  well this is definitely a good job its fit then  all right sure  oh i go first right  yep  okay there it is and okay hold on hold on  very close very close  hold on maybe just needs a little massaging just a little a little messagination misogyny wait no not that its very tight whoa  damn  whoa okay thats actually pretty good  yeah  this is awesome  alex thermal pads and test it  i think so this is just like a black acrylic cover  yep  cool these rods are still not long enough though if we wanna put our trim piece on  no but we have to take the heat sink off  right  cause theres going to be a tower attached to it  got it okay here we go since we dont know the exact z heights of anything in here were taking a bit of a yolo approach were gonna just error on the side of making our thermal pads a bit taller and then were gonna make sure that we mash down the cooler really well one way we can validate the thickness of our thermal pads is by putting this down with just a trace amount of thermal paste on the top there and seeing if it touches it it does not so clearly this is too thick lets pull that off lets go ahead and try one more time well see if yours thats the problem yes it touched barely  to make sure that we have thermal pads everywhere that we need them we can look at this little shield right here and we can see this one thermal pad were not able to hit with our plate here its for this little ic which is probably responsible for charging that potentially gets really hot  i have just the thing  knew it  a little tiny heat sink hes so cute look at him hes adorable then lets do a quick scan around at our thermal pads actually it looks like everything is making contact this is not terrible  yeah  all right fricking rock on this is the part where we screw it on  yeah  okay  well make double base first but yeah  get it close up out  oops  oh my god alex what the hell is going on man  alex well i didnt mean to put that much on there kind of just happened well need to scrape some off  oh my goodness i mean we do wanna go a little bit heavier than we normally would any extra is just gonna squeeze out anyway and were really not sure how great our contact here is gonna be but that  yeah that was a bit much  i didnt even take off that much actually should we fire it up  well lets put it back together  oh wow we never actually turned it off the game is still running  oh wow  okay well this is interesting  oh its running at 42 degrees holy crap  yeah we just put a big cold thermal mass on it  but still  i wonder if just adding this sink and then vent hole is enough  maybe  no itll heat up itll heat up itll heat up  but if we wanted to do this not dumb we probably could just add a bunch of little fins here it would passively dissipate a bunch of heat  a lot more than youd probably think might as well just leave it running i guess  you want big boy or small boy  i wanna go practical believe it or not  all right  i know who am i right lets go for the small one im gonna let you finish but theres a couple things going on here that you should know one is that this is flipping hot thermal transfer definitely taking place  oh wow oh my god linus laughs  two is we already dropped 10 degrees its at 71 on the gpu 72 and it has settled in we dont even need the fins on the back thats all valve had to do stick a burning hot hunk of metal on the back of the steam deck  it would make it uncompliant though  oh very  it would burn the users  yeah yeah oh alex hows this gonna stay  well were going to use this test it and ill put back on thermal epoxy later but we need to finish this video  okay cool oh my god please tell me it fits alex  wait does this one not fit  please tell me it fits  this one fits  are you sure did you fly too close to the sun  i fit it earlier  thermal expansion alex  oh that could be it actually we have to cool it down thats cooler  oh its still pretty hot i dont know man almost and the more this goes in there the more itll cool down faster  those tolerances  whew while it heats up here lets just appreciate the finished handy work alex full credit man this looks awesome that is hot rod pc cooling if i have ever seen it can we take a moment to appreciate that thermal right went and put a flame silhouette on this heat sink  its beautiful  match made in absolute heaven right here now do you mind pulling up the before numbers  alex sure i believe it was 86 degrees when we were in here  man it takes a long time to get up to temps now woo  thats why i used usbc  we actually made it up to exactly the same temps 81 well not quite 81 degrees celsius  alex yeah were about five degrees cooler now  but we did manage to drop almost 2000 rpm off the fan and its a 2000 rpm that counts for a lot it is way quieter  where do you see that  down here 5300 rpm  yeah it was 57 before  oh i thought it was 7000  no  oh wait it didnt work you know what i bet it is this thing is flipping hot v2 this with a fan you know what i bet we could even do that now lets mock it up ill be back with an noctua 40 mil in addition to adding a fan theres probably things we could do to more efficiently pull heat off of the soc like right now were just thermal paste just gooped in there and stuff like that its not ideal wow this really in there good though wow man thats freaking hot no way i dont know if its gonna get higher it might but it turns out that putting a fan on your cooler it works laugher people do it for a reason yeah you dont necessarily want all of this to control your fan  no but i think you could probably wire a fan into the board of the steam deck its gotta have five volts somewhere  yeah this is a five volt fan it would be a super easy put it in solder it would be fine what i worry is that it might cost you some of your overall power budget for the device  003 five watts and thats a full bore  okay its probably fine  yeah  this is incredible and without a doubt this would be my preferred steam deck if given the choice well and with the fan actually wired up internally  yeah of course  in our perfect world the mounting system for the external cooler would be such that you can unscrew it with thumbs screws or something like that pop it off and then put your normal plate on and have the whole system operate completely normally its just that alex noticed while we were off camera that there was a bit of a gap between our m2 cooler and the bottom plate and he vice griped them together and now they do not come apart  yeah its not coming apart ever again yeah  oh thats an interesting idea yeah one of the other side effects of putting the fan on is that this plate is a way more reasonable temperature now what are we looking at  looks like 49 degrees  yeah  which is right around you get burned but it takes a real long time whereas before it was you get burned but very fast

uY0pDe3rqOg,this mornings top headlines  july 13  morning news now,News,did very develop well  i am excited   me too we will tell you about them in a little bit   we begin with the latest on  the school shooting in uvalde we have released video revealing what unfolded inside robb elementary school over the  course an hour   it was obtained days before it was set to be shown to  families amid casting more doubts on law enforcements  response  and sam brock has the latest  and we want to warn you the  video may be disturbing  get in the room   reporter after weeks of  agonizing waiting the austin american statesman and tvue  releasing a compilation of videos including never before  seen surveillance from inside  the school and outside the build and body cam footage shedding more light on how law enforcement force respond casually carrying a rifle and  turning a corner in the hallway  a young student comes around the corner as the shooter walks  down the hall seconds later gunfire erupts lasting for more than two  minutes the child runs away three minutes later first officers entered the school as the gunfire continues some officers approach the  classrooms  others hold back  more shots and they retreat  19 minutes after the gunman  entered heavily armed reenforcements arrived with  ballistic shields holding up weapons but standing at the end  of the hallway waiting for nearly half an hour eventually a unit moves in a  stack formation towards the  clack room door others holding back 48 minutes after the gunman  enters more rounds and  inaudible conversation  one officer seen getting hand  sanitizer while the gunman is a  threat in the classroom after 77 minutes a volley of  gunfire when border patrol officers breached the  classroom  the sense of urgency didnt seem to be really felt or seen in that video and instead we know that those  19 children and two teachers were inside that classroom and it took more than an hour for  them to finally breach the door   the whole police system in  uvalde failed us   reporter vincent salazars 4th granddaughter was killed   what aspect of the video  will be most painful but necessary to see   when they sat back because  they got gunfire  they retreated  the officers aint trained to  retreat when they are going to do  they have to save the  children and they didnt do  that   reporter the videos release follows weeks of pain  and outcry from the youngel  community members  i    reporter lies jasmine who  lost her sister jackie   i was about to say good morning and i think thats  going to haunt me for the rest of my life   reporter families trying to  reconcile failures and an  apparent lack of answers   the answers we dont get is why they didnt act to protect babies   thanks to sam brock for the report  lets bring in law enforcement analyst chief cedric alexander  before the video was released top texas safety official  called the response to the shooting an abject failure  what do you call it after  watching this video what are the moments that stand  out most when you look at the  officers response   well i mean its really very very difficult video to  watch for someone who a has  been a first responder knowing that the children in the classroom and teachers were  being slaughtered and you had men outside who had  shields had helmets had  vests and high powered rifles themselves  and they failed quite frankly  to do the job that they were supposed to be sworn to do  it is very difficult for me to watch this video on so many  different levels  and i know how painful it is for the parents and the friends  of the victims to watch because here we expect they  expected in their community law enforcement to respond and to respond aggressively and when they heard shots  fired once they went down the hallway they retreated and  came back it is just a total failure  i think a lot of people need to  be held responsible theres been a lot of finger pointing and ive been saying this for weeks that too many people on the scene need to be held accountable   i want to ask you more about  that  we know the school district  police chief pete arredondo has  been blamed for a small  response  slow response to the shooting  but according to the austin  american statesman multiple responding agencies were on the  scene and that includes  officers from uvalde police  department the sheriffs  department law enforcement at state and federal levels  so we reached out to law enforcement official for comment we are waiting to hear back when you have multiple for converging on a scene like that how do you coordinate  that  what should be the protocol  well in a situation like that even if theres no appointed leadership theres  enough experience and trained  officers there that they take  action  they started to take action they went down the hallway  they heard gunfire which was  children being slaughtered and  they retreated back and for 77 minutes we had to  watch this and the parents  have to watch this so the blame  can go on a bunch of places quite frankly and every law enforcement  agency represented on the scene  has to share in some responsibility including including that state police  because on the onset theres  high heroism and et cetera et cetera  but as things continued to unfold we learned something  different and thank god a border patrol showing up and taking action but this could  have been stopped much much earlier and thats the price  you pay when you are a sworn officer you go to a school shooting we train people we are coming  in to take gunfire away from people who are defenseless  that clearly didnt happen here  and its embarrassing and  shameful and never should have happened that way my heart goes out to the community for a failure of law enforcement officials who was  there who were slow in their actions  cedric alexander thanks for  joining thus morning  we always appreciate your  analysis and expertise   thank you for having me   turning to the latest from the ongoing january 6th  hearings yesterday committee members laid out evidence they say former president trump was trying to hold onto power after  losing the 2020 election while  pushing the socalled big lie  to supporters saying the election was stolen  the committee zeroed in onth  several points one was the rhetoric showcasing a tweet a  rioter said inspired the planning for an insurrection  another focuse was oval office meeting described as unhinged there was testimony from the former oath keepers spokesperson and new information about possible witness tampering in the investigation we are going to dig into it and  start with showing you the major moments  president trump is promoting  big lie about the election  how does it make you feel  it makes me mad because i  was hanging on every word he was saying  everything he was putting out i was following it   we know you illegally entered the capitol and left the capitol area later on what made you decide to leave  basically when president trump put his tweet out we literally left right after  that come out you know to me if he would have done that earlier in the  day 130 you know we  wouldnt be in this  maybe wouldnt be in this bad of a situation or something   president trumps former  campaign manager brad parscale recognized the impact of the speech and this is what he said  on january 6th in excerpts from  text messages to katrina pierson  he said this is about trump pushing for uncertainty  in the country  a sitting president asking for civil war  i think the best  illustration for what the oath keepers are happened january 6th we saw that stacked military formation going up the stairs of our capitol  i can tell you that they may not like to call themselves a  militia but they are they are a violent militia   the inaugural address trump introduced one commanding  image american carnage that phrase explained little about the country before he  took office it turned out to  be an excellent prophecy of  what his rage would come to  visit on our people american carnage  thats donald trumps true legacy   after our last hearing president trump tried to call a  witness in our investigation  a witness you have not yet seen  in the hearings that person declined to answer or respond to president trumps  call  let me say one more time we  will take any effort to  influence witness testimony  very seriously   for more on this lets bring  in julie and good morning lets start with what we heard  the allegation that former president trump tried calling  up a potential witness after the last hearing  what more can you tell us about  that   yeah this is a second  hearing in a row that vice chair liz cheney is making this  cliff hanger saying that former  president trump or his allies  have engaged potentially in  witness tampering of the people  that they are trying to  interview and depose to get to the bottom of what happened on january 6th now after that happened yesterday we asked the  chairman more about this and  he simply said they dont know for certain if this witness  that liz cheney referred to  ended up receiving the call  from former president trump  exactly to witness tamper they dough known what the call was about and for his part former president trump responded on his social media  platform saying that its a  hoax which is as true as me  trying to strangle a secret  service agent in behind in the beast which is part of cassidy hutchinsons testimony  we doesnt note bottom line  whether the former president did engage in witness tampering  but they made it clear they  kicked it up to the department of justice to investigate  the committee focused on an  explosive and explicative oval office meeting in december of  2020 described as unhinged between white house officials  and prom innocent prominent  election denyers  why is that important  reporter they used pat cipollone to illustrate why it was important they pieced together the other folks that they interviewed who  were in that oval office meeting with the former  president without any official white house staff like pat cipollone who says when he walked in he was caught off  guard when he walked in everybody was  yelling trying to find a way to  move forward  but listen in their words what happened that night in that  meeting  at times there were people  shouting at each other  throwing insults at each other   harassing one set of  question  as a general matter where is the evidence  so  what response did you get   what do you mean wheres the  evidence  you should know things like that  or you know i would say a general disregard for the  importance of actually backing up what they say with facts  fired them and had them escorted out of the building   reporter committee really  illustrated the tugofwar between white house officials  and between the advisers who were employed in the white house and by former president  trump and others like ceo of overstock and all the other  figures that he said he had no idea what they were doing in the white house advising the president  we also learned former  president trump adlibed key  lines in the rally speech what did he change and why is  that significant   reporter the committee also  laying this out very importantly before they spoke  to their witness stephen ayres who was a rioter on the day who  actually said the words former president trump used is what inspired most of them to go to the capitol somethings he changed lug  adding references to former  vice president pence eight  times rather than just one in  the speech  remember he encouraged the  former vice president to overturn the election results  and not certify them  another reference was  encouraging the rioters to go  to the capitol and saying he would be there which we know  he didnt do   thank you so much   today is the first day of  president bidens fourday visit to the middle east which  includes stops in israel the  occupied west bank and saudi arabia  the trip comes amid mounting challenges for the president at  home and on the world stage global correspondent raf sanchez joins us  what can can we expect from the  trip   reporter president biden has a couple days of difficult and uncomfortable diplomacy and he will meet with the crown  prince of saudi arabia  but first he is coming here to  jerusalem without many answers about how to make progress on  the israelipalestinian  conflict  this morning president biden  on route to the middle east  heading to israel and saudi  arabia  both countries are us allies and both worry about the threat  from iran but they dont yet have  diplomatic relations  israels government tells us they hope bidens trip will  start to change that   i would like and maybe we expect some positive steps between saudi arabia and israel  during your presidents visit  here   reporter but theres a price to diplomacy  biden forced to pete faceto face with saudi crown prince best known as mbs the cia says he ordered the  murder of washington post  journalist jamal khashoggi  biden condemned saudi arabia on  the campaign trail   make they the pariah that they are   reporter but today he is looking for saudi help saying he hopes they and other arab states will pump of oil and  lower gas prices for american  drivers bidens israel visit partly  clouded by the killing of a  veteran palestinian american journalist with al jazeeraa the state department says she  was likely killed by mistake by  israeli troops back in may  israels military says they  dont know who killed her us not hopeful about restarting israelipalestinian peace talks the president will travel to jerusalem and occupied west  bank but not to gaza where  hamas militants feared thousands of rockets at israeli  cities  and israel carried out intense air strikes we head into the isolated strip  to see for ourselves  like in gaza its unbelievably  difficult four wars in 15 years economy collapsed and no  one here in the refugee camp tells us they think its going to get better under president  biden dana lost her mother and three siblings in an israeli strike  they are not numbers they have their lives they  have a dream   reporter she barely survive  the bombing herself  actually i was there for 12  hours  reporter you were  underneath the rubble for 12 hours  yeah  reporter do you remember that  what was it like under the rubble   i was conscious  i remember every second  reporter today she paints to remember her family and her loss   this painting is a mix of colors actually  reporter every picture a  reminder of the cost of failing  to achieve peace  now this is president bidens  tenth trip to israel and the first since taking office hes going to spend today and  tomorrow with the israelis  on friday he meets palestinians  and headed to saudi arabia friday afternoon   thanks so much  lets talk more about  president bidens trip to the  middle east with william wexler  the senior director of the center and middle east programs  at the atlantic council when it comes to foreign policy the middle east has  taken a back seat with the biden administration with more on competition with china and  russias war with ukraine why is this trip so important  for the a president right now  this trip is critically important in order to reaffirm the us commitment to the region our relationship with  our longstanding partners  with whom we need to a secure  or interests in the region and in fact globally   the white house says one of the presidents goals is to  deepen israels immigration  with arab countries in the region  but of course we need to talk about the relationship with the  palestinians especially as  tensions have been again high  recently  will the president do you think the president will take a  tougher stance on issues like  israel settlement building  which is illegal under international law and forced evicks of palestinians from  their homes living under occupation think they would like someone to rebuild the ties but is it the  president  i think what you will hear  from president biden he is  going to spend over an hour  talking to the leader of the palestinian authority is a  firm commitment from the united  states to support the two state  solution thats the only  solution that has a promise for  a permanent settlement of the  challenges between israelis and  palestinian people  you will hear president biden  talk about his commitment that the palestinians share the same  measure of freedoms security  and prosperity that currently  is enjoyed by israelis  you will likely hear significant economic assistance  given to the palestinians and  you will hear likely additional  assistance from the gulf countries to the palestinians  and president biden is going  to urge saudi arabia and other gulf countries to ramp up oil  production when he heads to the  kingdom and later this week in a bid  to try to push prices down  its seen as reversal of the pm campaign position to make a  country a pariah over the human  rights abuses washington post publisher wrote  an opinion piece titled bidens  trip to saudi arabia erodes the  moral authority it sends a  message the us is willing to looked other way when the  commercial interests are at  stake what do you think do you agree with the view   i dont  the united states has multiple interests including human  rights  all of which need to be  balanced  president biden is not the first us president to  recognize the difference between talking on the campaign  trail and dealing with a necessary complexities and inherent tradeoffs of governance  this is the right decision to  go to saudi arabia and its  quite a normal decision us presidents always go to saudi arabia  not going would be widely  abnormal  i believe president obama went four times to saudi arabia  reestablishing an effective  working relationship between washington and them is going to  be priority and this part of the world especially national  relationships are driven by  personal relationships from the  top down   thanks so much for joining  thus morning  we appreciate it   thank you   now first lady dr jill  biden is facing backlash after comments she made about latino diversity at an event in texas  the first laid why apologized  for the remarks that critics called offensive  and nbc news chief white house correspondent has the latest   reporter dr jill biden  learning a painful political lesson  the first first lady teaching  at community college apologizing for a misstep  monday  during a speech to the nations  largest latino civil rights  group intend to celebrate the  communitys diversity  your fight is our fight  and we will stand with you   reporter making headlines  for a controversial comment  fumbling the pronunciation of  new yorks famed bodegas   diversity of this community as distinct as the bodegas of  the bronx as beautiful as the blossoms of miami and as  unique as the breakfast tacos  here in san antonio  reporter the audience  cheered but the scripted comment generated backlash on  social media  one prominent hispanic troupe  encouraging them to better understand the complexities of the our people and communities  adding we are not tacos  dr biden spokesman tweeting the first lady apologizes her  words conveyed anything but  pure admiration and love for the latino community  dr biden has been a relentless  advocate for her husbands agenda visiting 40 states in  less than 18 months but this appearance is bringing  unwanted attention to the  presidents closest political  partner peter alexander nbc news  the summer heat and  humidity sparking storms in  several cities  lets check your morning news  now weather  michelle grossman is with us   we hit storms in the northeast yesterday today we will move it to the south and see gusty storms  so heres set up with storms off to the southwest  thats monsoonal moisture storms in the great lakes and  front thats going to interact with gulf moisture and thats  going to bring heavy rainfall  up to 5 in  some spots storms and lightning and hearing the thunder and this is where we expect the  weather carolina and texas  winds gusting up to 60 miles per hour  could see hail and chance of a tornado the risk is low but its not zero  we will watch that as we go  throughout the afternoon hours  we have seen rain for days we will continue to see rain for  days  we have the bermuda high and a  big area of eye pressure funneling in the gulf moisture and interacting with the trigger of that front and thats where we will see storms along the front  so tropical air hits the front  we will generate torrential  downpours we could see 2 to 3 quickly within the downpours  and then we will see these over  days  slow mock and the low is lingering and meandering along the coast and it is aiding in the storms  the ground is wet we have been wet for weeks  and we will add to the totals  over the next several days  this is what it looks like in  terms of the rainfall forecast  this is where we look at 3 to  5  again we could see more than  that within the heavy downpours  throughout the afternoon  and that extends through sunday  talking about the dangerous  heat once again because its a big story heat warnings in the inner mountain west and rockies and  26 million people impacted in  the south once again  still sweltering in the south  with temperatures into the 90s  the triple digits we are getting tired of this and we are not feeling it in the south you will feel it  through the weekend as well 104 in dallas its going to feel like 106 in the heat extends
fEMwQKhauNo,stanley cup final game 6 highlights  avalanche vs lightning  june 26 2022,Game,i think it comes from the tampa bay lightning just solidifying this crowd solidifying their beliefs i think its a key start for the avalanche here to have something positive happen in those first five to ten minutes nick paul starts at center along with brandon hagel and alex fellorna centering pass but given a couple of early chances as he starts up front with our terry lincoln some of it comes from frustration about how about the first shift first chance right on the doorstep he gets the rebound back not available applause applause look to the official to see if there might be a call on that shear knock sends it in and theres mckinnon trying to take him out because they battle in behind the net puck came losing music applause music you think he got body position on him the kid has got him but he slides off keeps this one alive watch as the play goes around just an excellent quick move in front as kucherov comes down does he no he doesnt have that first second it might have been a hand pack then he got it with the stick and look at kemper leads the lead but its the two on one goes to the net stopped by a quick turn here by cogliato back in comes lindas gone applause right on the doorstep best stop for vasilevskiy and hes made two or three so far in this opening period the blocked shot but heres the chance for cadre right in front and stephen stampos had five in game number four doing the splits ranting and falling down this one gets chipped up and goes right off the post actually just off the wide and thats another thing that colorados tried to theres nate mckinnon three shots in the first period craig only three colorado forwards registered shots in the opening period applause the other two landed cadre granting him from up top steered away mckinnon tried to route applause mckinnon sort of an effect theres a chance to clear the zone instead its kept alive atlanta stock to the outside and the kickoff look at missed coverage there paul and hitman just a little bit late firing with the hard pass and the onetimer finds a way underneath the arm as vasilevskiy was sliding back to the post see if you can see the daylight under the blowing beat the blocker to the side i thought it might have been between the arm two of the four former anaheim ducks in this series and theyve all been prominent hill lacrosse he got back and helen unable to slide that through the backhand against the left the games heating up an end to end action puck comes right back to the middle again up it goes to ross colton who had the series winner a year ago over the line corey perry trying to cut in and he got a shot away right stop perry is elusive pulls this one around the heart shot pass denied by palat now stamkos cant get loose and luckily turns back the other way got mckinnon breaking collected and fires right on and the rebound played past him the ice opens up the potential for an odd man rush i thought mckinnon really wanted that puck down low instead the shot by lekkanen the non calls there you see very much applause far side mikko ransomen up ahead manson three on two mckinnon trying to get it back johns gone arturi up though and then this one bouncing in the middle a pass across its just a quick release look at that galecki were sliding over to his right and weve seen so often him being able to track those manson tries to pass mckinnon tries it of back a game winner in game four but in game first here comes chernak a onehanded backhand and he is written into the end board in elimination games in the last two years the lightning seven on the floor and maybe a chance here alex in shooting and the rebound kicked away the assignments so critical watch as this play develops cadres over by the puck but he makes it known from a car for colorado in the second just over three and a half to go a faceoff win and rant in a good spot right on and and so vasilevskiy has to come up big and here with the traffic in front theres the hesitation by ranting still able to get the shot over kucharov across that goes off the stick of her potter charging in time for a shot gossalecki the same at the horn to the line byron handed it away and heres a two on one cory perrys in across and the shot went wide kucherov with a great heres mckinnon flipping it through off the blocker of vasilevskiy lincoln and centers to chewskin stopped by vasilevskiy and just cant connect down in tight and now the other way right in the slot comes in checked on the play there by mcdonough cadbury with the applause in the first 12 minutes of this third so youre looking for a spark from someone to get things going and wins the draw cadres got it to the net the rebound laid his paws back towards fatsalefty who was able to hold it out right now the traffic in front has been a bit of an issue at times theres a good job of land to stock though fighting off colton and if nothing else you get another offensive zone faceoff in this entire period from a faceoff perspective seemingly heres stamkos working his way back in fire not off yet right on and kemper has that best chance on net here in the third round mccarran wanted byrom on that faceoff win to shot to the bench instead he stayed on youre a little bit lacks youre back there and hes got a good night in the faceoff circle the stamp place prevails loose puck nicole right on and a rebound comes back out to center and theyll have to recalculate the dynasty will be denied and a new legacy begins they greets the seventh and the ambulance our 2022 stanley cup champions applause music you
TFE9wfAfudE,this ugly pc will blow your mind,Tech,omg a two fan gpu finally applause gpu makers what are you doing its the same thing every generation massive carefully designed heat sinks and then you go and ruin it by slapping these dinky three dollar fans on them to try and keep everything cool you might not realize it but those fans are one of the most common points of failure on a graphics card and with most of them either too difficult to take apart or impossible to find replacements for a lot of the time your only options are to throw the graphics card away or rip the whole shroud off and zip tie on whatever fans youve got lying around well noctua must have been paying attention because they did basically that with the help of asus they came together to create the ultimate rtx 30 series cards and theyre glorious so what better way to celebrate them than by building the all knock to a gaming pc so hop on board baby next up brown town wait next stop this message from our sponsor pdq take patch management off your plate by automating it pdq can keep your machines patched and up to date automatically giving you time to do more important things like watching ltt start your free trial at pdqcom linus music its no secret that here at ltt we are giant enthusiasts of noctua products youll find them in just about every machine we build here at the office and if our staff arent going for an rgb look at home you can bet that theyre using noctua products for their zero compromises approach to performance and reliability and its with zero compromises in mind that we began our knock to a pc by finding an excuse to use the biggest fan they officially offer this 200 millimeter absolute unit of a cooling fan there arent actually a ton of cases out there that support this size even then you have to be careful because this fan is 30 millimeters thick that is five more millimeters than the standard 25 were gonna have this and everything that weve used linked in the video description below so just because a case comes with 200 millimeter fan support from the factory does not mean that it will support noctuas as replacements looking at you lee and lee now obviously a plain black case on its own wasnt good enough for a machine like this so we had our resident da vinci work his magic with the paint booth and wow does this ever look amazing shout out nicholas for really pushing this build to the next level look at this weve even got noctua themed back pci covers i just realized i never actually named the case we selected its the master box h500 argb from cooler master and the reason we chose it aside from it fitting our 200 millimeter fans is that this build is all about performance and airflow and it certainly has that with a full mesh front panel that supports not just one but two of our 200 millimeter fans look at that isnt that incredible and a large top vent complete with magnetic fan filter that supports another two 140 millimeter fans and finally a single 120 millimeter exhaust at the back the process for installing these is a little fun you got to pop the pop the front panel off just like that you got this nice little mesh dome actually love this from an airflow perspective and then this bad boy is going to be an intake for us and its going to go a little something like fan cable through oh my god how are we going to get this fan cable through here i guess like that wow yup thats gonna take up the whole space all right were gonna use noctuas cool little silicone vibration isolators to install our fans so you just pop one of these bad boys through a little something like this a little tedious but does that look freaking amazing or what its a giant wall of cooling performance you simply cannot put anything in here that is not getting a blast of fresh air my one regret is not enough knock to a fence thankfully we have more oh thats not an nfa 14 but thats okay because this is a 120 mil for the back oh my god its been so long since ive used these i forgot how youre supposed to install them you put the silicone things in the fan first oh shoot i need another one oh so dumb yeah theyre all in wrong oh my god i had a brain brown fart moment here i totally installed these wrong its been so long since ive used these i normally just use screws you put the long side into the fan like i did but you dont do it through the case thats what this little notch right here is for thats where the case sits so for those of you who were head desking up until this point in the video im sorry im sorry im fixing it so then you oh wow these holes are really tight okay it went it went boy was that ever a tight fit look at that vibration isolating goodness look at all that play its a good thing maybe there were people out there screeching that its supposed to go case side first when i did it the last time i dont know guys i just used screws so that i can talk about our screwdriver lttstorecom not yet soon yes got it all right now i have to line up four things at once instead of one at a time and theyre all floopzy its like getting a flaccid thing into a tight thing you know a knock to a cable extensions all right lets put this back fan in yeah with properly sized holes this is a fair bit easier boom done look at that installed this is glorious i dont even want to cut off the little nubbins i say we keep them yeah you cant even see the our case wasnt the only piece that needed the knock noctua treatment though and our motherboard gave us plenty of opportunities to add color accents x570 boards in general and our tough series from asus is no exception often include active cooling for the chipset giving us a perfect opportunity to replace that generic little whiny fan with one from noctua so to begin our operation we put our baby little 40 by 10 millimeter noctua under the knife removing everything but the impeller and the fan blades themselves unfortunately the heatsink shroud around the stock fan didnt really accommodate our thicker noctua replacement which necessitated some overly precise tormach action to make it fit but you can see how well it turned out enjoy it while you can though because by the time the build is done you wont be able to see it anymore oh boy well thats not gonna help turns out they do still need me for something oh i guess we went with a one terabyte wd blue because it didnt matter what we chose because its under a heat sink if i was to choose an m2 for this build based on the overall theme of reliability i would probably go with something from samsung we dont have any experience with wd blues dying in particular but based on the numbers out of puget samsung makes shockingly reliable ssds so theres just a degree of trust there that i dont necessarily have for this particular drive on the subject of things you wont be able to see when were done there was no way we were going to be satisfied with any old power supply so knowing that alex had already taken apart this ax 1600i from corsair we thought it would be the perfect candidate for a little noctua operation a little snip of the cables followed by some solder action and the end result looks pretty darn near factory under this painted fan grill not bad right i think we could have gone well okay theres some theres some problems but theyre cosmetic theyre cosmetic okay the good thing we replaced it too because this fan ends up spinning up to its highest rpm during boot and the factory corsair unit in my opinion unacceptably loud easily the most noticeable one in the system though in fairness to corsair it would have immediately spun down to like zero okay one thumb screw later power supply shroud comes off its actually a very easy case to work in very standard oh this feels so wrong i guess it doesnt really matter because we wouldnt see the fan anyway its covered in this shroud but okay well know its there brandon this is what i was thinking when i lost my train of thought corsair used to include and apparently still does little magnetic replacements for the labels look at that clean now we are still going to cover it though little pro building tip if you want to save yourself some hassle later you can preinstall your modular cables on the motherboard and then run these as youre installing the board rather than once youve already put heat sinks and everything on here and its real difficult to get at them couple other things we should probably install on the motherboard before going any further weve got an amd ryzen 7 5800 x3d it may only have eight cores but damn it it uses their 3d v cache and is the fastest gaming cpu in their lineup well get that boy popped in there and weve actually got a second ssd this is the one you guys are meant to believe were booting off of but its mostly just for show this is a corsair mp600 ssd so not even like top of the line anymore but we just liked it because we could put it here and put a little knock to a fan on it and plug it in like there unfortunately theres nothing knocked too well about our 64 gig kit of 3 600 mega transfer per second crucial ballistics memory we cant even put a knock to a cooler on it unless we make our own by 3d printing it is oh lordy its not the most elegant thing in the world were using motherboard screw holes see that standard atx screw holes to get this bad boy on here but boy is that ram ever going to be silent silent ram its all like bad but but not muted unfortunately i managed to scuff our totally awesome professional rattle can paint job a little bit here but thats okay because ive got a little paint tip for you guys spray some of your paint onto a plastic surface like this get a little stick or something like that put that in there you can get some little touchups going on in here come check this out brian hows that it wont have quite a perfect finish from six inches but from six feet youd never notice it so many things about this build feel out of water but we finally got into the cpu heatsink and oh come on we gotta go with the classic ladies and gentlemen thats right we actually obtained a black knock to a fan and then replaced it with a brown and tan one because knocked to a pc wait cryo rig thermal compound get this out of my face cant do the all lock to a pc without using noctua thermal compound geez i guess thats what i get for asking stupid questions like wheres the thermal compound gee i dont know linus maybe in the box for the cooler you know it was actually a very noctua inspired process by which we brought our screwdriver to life i remember having a conversation with their ceo where i said well to make the best fans you guys must have the best engineers and he kind of laughs and he goes well no we have good engineers but its more about giving them the time to do their best work and thats why its taken two and a half years to make a screwdriver oh my goodness there you go all right one cpu cable two cpu cable oh come on where is the other one corsair has these ah these heat shrink tubes on there cables that ah there we go we had wanted to have cable mod cables for this matching our knock to a color scheme but unfortunately there was a shipping delay we werent here in time those eight pins would not go in if they were not preinstalled at all for our first screw were going top right which means were going to be using a custom length motherboard screw this is because its got to go through that 3d printed ram cooler oh yeah its threaded nice were glossing over a lot of the cabling but the summary is lots of extensions lots of ysplitters weve got all of these fans plugged into the motherboard headers now all we got to do is get some ltt store cable ties now available in so many fun colors though unfortunately not brown now its time for the centerpiece of our build the collab you did not know you needed the asus x noctua rtx 3070 wait what are we putting a 3070 in here for gpu prices are way better now lets go for the newer 3080 edition shall we it looks exactly the same but thats not a bad thing everything about this design is performance first from the back plate to the massive 120 millimeter cooling fans to the 43 slot thickness though i do have to say i wonder how much of the performance of it is noctuas fan engineering and how much is just that it has a massive massive heat sink with a suicided extra clearance here for the heatsink so that the airflow could kind of blow out around the card better oh probably lots id buy this one 100 brandon you dont get it you dont buy noctua components for the looks you buy them for the performance thats their whole shtick no one will care what it looks like if the performance is outstanding wow even the m2 way down here on the board is i would say barely accessible i think i could probably swap it out but it wouldnt be easy we do get one expansion slot weve got this one pcie by one down here so thats good otherwise this gpu has taken up the whole thing as for cable management for our power connectors here rather than come down to the power supply like this were gonna go up and over and were gonna strap it in really tight at the back to try to relieve some of the strain on our poor pcie slot here so bear with me i wouldnt really recommend this but i am doing it so make of that what you will okay lets see is it more level actually not bad well bad but not unattractive all thats left now is to fire it up time for the big moment oh yeah you can hear it a little you can hear it a little the all knock to a pc does make a little bit of noise but give it a second i suspect thats just the gpu ramping up oh its the power supply wow is that ever quiet that is amazing my mic is right here i am literally whispering right now and im inside this man computer can feel the suck too not that it sucks its just airflow while we apply our memory overclock profile i can share with you some fun things about our peripherals this may be rgb up the butt but whats that brown switches from gadaron and well this is more just story time than anything else this was the one gaming mouse we could find with a fan in it we really wanted to put an octopus fan in there but they dont make one that small so it is now the loudest part of this build oh wow what is this windows 95 what is happening allow me to just paint finish up my desktop wallpaper here were obviously gonna have to get in game for a while but guys ive got the panel closed stays so quiet wow our gpu is at 330 watts running at 64 degrees and i can barely hear the bloody thing that is wild hows our cpu doing oh i dont know maybe 67 degrees while drawing oh okay thats only 62 months i guess that fan just hasnt even ramped up i swear i can hear a computer over on the short circuit set better than i can hear this one it is so quiet this is in game now this is legitimately in game the one thing the pc cant cool though is me thankfully though i have this see if we can do a little better here yeah i mean you gotta test it in the real world brandon i dont know why the fps counter is not working thats extremely frustrating pretty quiet hey this band at the back is its got some toast though its hot is it hot in there oh here let me help you with that well that ones pretty quiet too uh no this ones pretty loud yeah this is not an actual knock to a product um and its not very quiet the rig though is the only awkward part of the conversation is the price weve got somewhere in the neighborhood of 400 worth of fans in here well outside the budget of most people when it comes to configuring a gaming rig but hey you cant fault the performance or in my humble opinion the look because this may be one of the most ironically gorgeous builds

CSQ8tmHhhNw,eating only worst rated food for 24 hours 1 star,Food,whats up mr faze adapt ruggy whats going on i have a proposal what that is 1v1 russ and if you win i will buy you five star meals all day i cant just have you chilling in san diego why go do this you know i mean so the loser has to eat one star meals also paid for by the loser i still got it in me brother you think hey lets hop on right now lets try it then if you really believe that bro ill see you on the sticks brother he really doesnt yeah i dont think he really has that where are you oh dab wow you might be eating some onestar meals baby oh oh so youre going up top okay not up top oh yeah here we go all right whats going on here no way youre jumping off the top oh my god i know exactly where you are right now and you dont oh why dont my no scopes freaking hit ah yeah oh why am i trying to no scope why dont you even do that dont even do that hey good game good game go have fun at your fivestar restaurants bro i will all right guys looks like im gonna be eating onestar meals for the entire day breakfast lunch and dinner hopefully i dont get sick by the end of this and adapt is gonna run up my pockets i know him lets go get some breakfast and read some bad reviews alright guys so were pulling up to the first restaurant and it doesnt even look like its there anymore its like a tire shop or something quick question is there a restaurant it hasnt been for a year well it looks like the first place was so one star that they went out of business oh what the heck look at this so i guess it was this i mean to be honest if i saw a restaurant like this i probably wouldnt eat here especially if it was one star like was this the entrance to the restaurant yeah okay well im glad that theyre closed down because i for sure would have got sick but all right we gotta find a new breakfast spot all right guys so we just walked in we grabbed two menus and you can actually seat yourselves which is pretty cool and this is kind of like the look of the restaurant so the style it feels like youre about to eat like a homecooked meal in your backyard and i dont know it just feels homey i think it looks really really cool back here so whenever youre ready to order you just go up you place the order and im actually going to order the huevos rancheros because i did see a review on that and they showed like a picture of what it looked like so i want to review that so the review said it looked like a slop and it didnt taste any better so heres the picture of what the yelp reviewer took and im going to show you a comparison when my food comes in wow okay im not gonna lie this looks so fire look at that ooh the over medium eggs dude this looks delicious it is time for the taste test the most important part we got the rice we got the beans we got the potatoes whoa thats actually fire im gonna eat it with the tortilla as well all right were gonna get a real bite here okay we got the eggs got the rice we got the beans we got the tortilla we need a potato this is the real bite it really does feel like a homecooked meal it feels like this is something my mom would cook and im eating in her house right now honestly were starting off really strong for breakfast im really shocked that this was rated two stars in general because it looks a lot different than the picture keep in mind that picture of the huevos ranchero that the yelp reviewer put was actually 10 months ago so maybe in the past 10 months they hired new people or they just have a new recipe or something like that but in my opinion this is juicy it has sauce the flavors are all there and i would go ahead and rate this like an 85 out of 10 not bad for like one of the worst reviewed places in san diego dude its actually fire the beans are really really good too wow bro we for real have five star meals on rugs tab all day yeah were about to go stupid what foods you usually like to eat chicken tenders excuse me can you put your window down all right listen guys we made it location number one the beverly hills hotel ive never been here either so i dont know whos really with me we also validated the car because thats also on rug right yeah thats for sure on his tab im gonna be invoicing him real soon i dont know what your a face nah im a dapps cameraman no its my camera man no your face rocks dude hes tripping i dont know whats up with that kid man are you guys youtubing tick tockers loki yeah we do renegades like on saturdays thats pretty much a part of phase rug i dont believe you whats your overall thoughts on the vibe so far very cool yeah what are the odds you hop in that pool im not going in the pool well try scrambled eggs with uh can we do wheat bread and bacon and then buttermilk pancakes we gotta get that too ill do the wagyu hot dog hot dogs for breakfast youre gnarly this is what were starting off with whoa what do we got there its breakfast spot one and some pancakes eggs scrambled bacon why do you keep saying scrambled what does that mean thats how theyre prepared all right first bite of the pancake lets see are they any better than an ihop thats what were trying to find out is that five star rating no its actually really good really wagyu hot dog the bun looks crazy raising canes toast thats what it looks like oh god it does music chew it sure chew it swallow it inhale that tastes like a regular hot dog yeah you wanted something yeah lets try it oh great bite its solid but like is it five star quality eggs are really hard to pick up the pancakes definitely taste better than like ihop or dennys you know these are phenomenal breakfast overall what would you rate this entire experience so far out of five out of five or out of ten lets do out of five lets go to 15 15 15 im gonna give it a food a 14 14 its my favorite number and its good but overall experience not bad the foods really good everythings really good but our server is really nice helped us out he put on some uh yeah for me for breakfast it was about 180 bucks for breakfast for what we got lets see whats next all right guys so we lucked out with the breakfast spot it was super good and now lets just hope the last two meals of the day are like this all right guys behind me is americas most haunted house if this video breaks 300 000 likes i will stay overnight in this house yes how are you nice to meet you hey do you think they should like the video because if they break right now if they break 300 000 im gonna stay in this haunted its not a hotel its a house all right guys so the next meal is actually in the san diego zoo and theres many bad reviews paragraphs which i dont want to read but i see one right here that says this is the worst food i ever had the tofu was so hard with absolutely no flavor my family also ordered the burger which was also terrible never had such bad food before i would imagine the only reason they have business is because there are not a lot of options in the san diego zoo so were literally gonna buy tickets just to go eat at this restaurant for you guys and once again hopefully i dont get sick and hopefully its like the first place and its decent but i usually dont eat when i come to the zoo because i dont think the food would be great but hey we gotta test it out and i think its right next to the panda exhibit so lets go thank you appreciate it all right guys we got two tickets it was 134 just so we could eat at this restaurant and this is another twostar restaurant like were not trying to lie and say its one star but there arent a lot of onestar restaurants in san diego but we found another twostar reviewed one and well see how it tastes all right oh i found it i literally found in like one second weve got a lot of walking to do man lets go all right we made it so another item that everyone was talking about that wasnt the best is the teriyaki chicken so im probably gonna get that with the veggies hi um can i just do the teriyaki chicken 17 but then again thats like zoo food along with like amusement parks they always overprice im excited to see how it looks and tastes guys it took three minutes for this to be ready i dont know how to feel about that but ill be back all right here we go i got my lunch food right here were in the cafeteria of the zoo what do they call this vegetarian green beans green beans okay so one review i did read is they said that the veggies were mushy this kind of does look a little mushy you see that how it like pulled apart but lets try it okay it does kind of melt in your mouth broccoli a bit mushy ill agree with that review lets try the rice hmm its sticky was it worth 140 no no definitely wasnt worth 140 bucks i dont think anyone in their right mind would do that i think we need to at least enjoy the zoo after this now main part the chicken bro this is important because you can get sick if the chickens not cooked right but its not like a wow but if youre taking into consideration that its at the zoo its like not bad lets do a combo you know chicken rice and green beans here we go my camera is pretty close to my face i mean all in all its not a bad meal when youre at the zoo and youre hungry take a little break sit in the shade enjoy this meal this will definitely fill you up for the rest of your trip for being in the zoo its not bad im gonna give it 65 out of 10 while im eating this i wonder what adapt and noah are up to i cant imagine the food theyre eating man excuse me all right so location number two were at the rooftop by jg see what we got first impression of this place is nice damn lets get it i feel like im like under dress for this under dress what are you talking about so right now were going to the rooftop by jg hey this is nice i dont think ive ever been here please enjoy thank you should we get a 850 bottle of champagne no thats crazy we got bottle service here though yeah honestly i dont even know why were even talking about prices if were not paying for it so i should just go for the big boy steak then huh 220 steak thats what were doing were just gonna get the most expensive thing on the menu well share it well share it bro that waters insane excuse me bro before you pay a rug can cover that if you want it that looks amazing wow thats some serious 200 bucks this could feed us twice what thats all you doug its a tomahawk yeah you take a little bite off that yeah yeah wow you might need to try that yeah yeah you got them thats bomb though should we get busy yeah get busy with it lets see what we got here damn im not gonna lie ive had better stakes really yes for sure that are cheaper i think its the quantity yeah and like where we are you know what i mean were literally on top of a roof overall opinion i mean i only had a few bikes i dont think that this is worth 200 bucks really no so were leaving overall mid mid mid mid seriously man i was not impressed but the setup was cool the setup was the experience yeah except for what actually mattered which was the food yep all right guys it is time for dinner we walked around the zoo for a little bit kind of let that 140 bucks go to waste chilled for a little bit after and now its time for another twostar meal so this is an italian food place it has two stars and im not gonna lie the most recent review was a five star and that was seven days ago but this review nine months ago says we ordered a pizza and two salads for delivery to our home a mile away the salad was fine but the pizza was raw it had to be thrown away i called the restaurant and spoke to the manager who said he would check the order and call me back well he never did so hence the poor review never ordering from here again and spread the word to our neighborhood so i think we got to order the pizza and heres a picture i saw that it says super greasy red chili based spaghetti sauce it doesnt look too appetizing ill tell you that much lets go test out the pizza and hopefully hopefully we get something good how can we get our picture on the wall oh really wait so can i get a picture really is this real yes i like it thank you thank you so much dude im already

facebook by my mother agent well i dont remember when but i was like 15 i think and i was in high school and i thought oh gosh thats super weird but like kind of cool that someone would think that i would… i could be a model or whatever so yeah i responded to her and my mom and i we looked at her website and she had this one model who was like walking a lot of cool shows and like doing a lot of campaigns and things like that which i didnt know what they were at the time but i had heard of some of the brands before you know like chanel or like something like that so i was like oh wow this is

friends worked with a lot of creative and cool people i never thought i would like have success in this job my first show it was two years ago in new york i walked calvin klein i dont remember actually walking in the show because i was super nervous its weird now when i do three shows in a day its like its one little blip on the fashion radar but for me it was like so awesome and cool and i

difficile parce quelles sont sublimes when i was younger i used to do gymnastics i was like competing and i have some really good photos of me doing it that one and that one the best makeup tip that i ever got its more of a skin care tip but its to like spray toner or like some kind of hydrate hydrating spray on your face before you put on moisturizer because that way you actually get the moisture in your skin otherwise its just gonna evaporate or something you have to like put on moisture and then put something over it you want to go and then im going to finish off like i only need one second

many vogue covers have you had in your career i think its close to 60 oh my god one of my favorite things about fashion week is learning about what new innovations designers are using to become more sustainable i agree completely after you do a show its always really nice getting together and to go out catch up yeah its like you dont get to see your friends all the time until fashion week everybodys always working and now youre working together so thats cool being with my friends yeah like the moment having yeah… having like dinners together when you can its quite nice and you also

day because its just so comfortable opening spotify music i did want to make a whole like bedroom video but theres honestly not that much that im going to add to my bedroom just because i kind of want my bedroom to be like a little sanctuary where i can go and relax and just chill on my bed and also my bed takes up most of the space there is things i still need to buy like a mirror for my vanity and like accessories and a night table and all this kind of stuff speaking of the bed this video is actually sponsored by bed shirt bed shirt is the perfect company to cozy up your bedroom or dorm or

there it is music honeymoon music breathe she is honestly music i am so excited today is rosinas birthday party and i have been running around all day nonstop i am not kidding i have so much to do ive been listening to literally mexican medicine music because its so fast that it makes me like work faster i dont know if that makes sense ive been filming cleaning cooking editing emails so much stuff right now showering i dont know if this is a good decision because im so busy i literally ordered walmart to my apartment thats how living in the city i guess is but anyways i ordered walmart to my apartment because i ordered a bunch of cake mix and like decorations for my house and like all this stuff for rosinas birthday and considering that i have so much to do i dont know if its the best decision for me to make this right now it would just really make a difference basically whats happening for rosinas birthday is her and michaela are coming over and im gonna fully finish this cake and like have stuff here theyre gonna finish getting ready here and then at like 7 45 we have dinner at a super fancy restaurant so i actually have to get ready and then were going to sleep over here were probably going to go to a bar after and then theyre going to sleep over here i really just want to have it be nice for them so thats why im like i dont know if i should make this cake but i feel like if i do it would really make her day you know i mean music okay the cake is out and i just got a text from rosina saying that theyre gonna be here in five minutes so im gonna quickly as fast as i can decorate this cake watch this music oh we have no time guys im so stressed i am so stressed why did i choose to do this i dont know i dont know okay rosina if youre watching this im doing it for you girl this is not okay music im so sorry for dreaming about the future um applause music okay im back in my apartment and boy let me tell you whats that disaster i think i dropped all my plants on the way here let me show you what i got starting off with number one she used to be so much prettier before she was squished in a freaking bag in my car she needs help this is chinese money plant so i feel like it must actually i think its just because these are shaped in coins but i feel like it might be like a lucky charm like money attractor type of vibe anyways it looks really sad right now because i freaking killed it i got this bad boy banana musa i literally im kind of disappointed in myself i crushed like all of these plants on the way here that is so humiliating i also got this monstera plant i feel like this is like uh not a basic one but like a pretty common one that people get i also got this white little pot and the last one i got is this one i really like this one this is a peace lily it comes with a little flower on top and i just think its gorgeous im gonna pot all my plants and yeah if you guys have any plant tips please let me know because i dont know anything about plants when you were younger you didnt see things quite the same as you do now but now youre older you find that sometimes you wish music hi good morning music um guys i had a mental breakdown all day yesterday mental breakdown first mental breakdown of living alone guys todays been a bad day todays been a bad day and this is going to be the reality the reality that behind the scenes of living alone im just really overwhelmed right now i feel like i have a growing list of tasks so much that i need to like film so much i need to edit i have sponsors that i need to hand in i have to go to fedex and like send packages i have my credit card that i need to fix i have flights i need to plan i have this trip that i need to but like i feel like this whole month ive just like neglected all my responsibilities and im realizing that its really hard to cook for yourself every day clean after yourself freaking lonely alone here i feel like i need a human interaction and i havent talked to anyone in like three days which is like literally nothing that is not long but i feel like everything is just kind of overwhelming me right now i could start getting my routine like get my    together this next week but i leave for a trip next week on tuesday and i have so much prep to do for that trip living alone has very many pros the cons i would say are that theres no one here to really console you and i guess im just adulting i guess that this is what it is where everybody is waiting on you and you have so much to do and you just feel like you cant really catch a break because theres always something on my mind thinking like oh but you could be doing this or but you could be doing this and its like i start doing something and then i stop that because i think somethings more important and then i end up doing everything halfassed and im just like what am i even doing thats how i feel right now and im just stressed im also stressed i dont know i dont know what was in the air dont know if mercury was in retrograde dont know if im gonna get my period dont know if it was because i got my extensions done and i got a new perfume and while spraying it and my head being in so much pain i felt like extremely overstimulated and irritated and i also dont know if it was because i had no plan i hadnt seen anyone and it was super excessively cloudy and gloomy yesterday could have been a mixture of all three of those things or all 50 of those things that i just listed but yesterday was not a vibe i just felt super overwhelmed i still do feel overwhelmed but i slept in this morning until 10 am so i feel like a little bit better to like sum it up i guess i didnt realize how hard it was to actually move in to somewhere moving out for the first time in general is kind of like really a big deal and i guess i didnt like register it as a big deal and you know its the first time for many things its the first time where you have so much responsibility and its the first time where you know youre completely alone you dont have anyone really to just like rely on and i live a little further away from my family and my friends so you know theres a lot of new things happening as well as like work balancing everything and like also trying to balance having a social life you know like now im in the city and i want to go out on the weekends and i feel like i just kind of hit a wall after a gogogo for like a month and a half straight and now im getting a little bit overwhelmed and then i travel next week so its like when is the routine happening i am going to take you along my day today because todays gonna be a better day i woke up i put some like workout clothes on just to like you know feel a little bit better brushed out my hair i did my skincare wash my face and now i think im gonna put some music on and im going to clean my apartment because its super messy music yesterday i actually went to zara and i got this perfume and its called gardenia and ive heard that this is supposed to be like a dupe for the black opium by ysl honestly i dont know if it is i dont even remember what the other one smells like but all i know is it smells really good and this is my new favorite purchase it is a hat from aloe yoga ive been wearing it so much recently i just really like the way it fits and frames my face also this mini hoodie is from also concepts collab with los angeles apparel im finally home guys look at my little tent kind of a burn low key i just drove home and i was like i had my top down in my car and i definitely just got a tan and im so excited look how many things i just bought and picked up im going to give you guys a haul im lowkey foaming on the fact that its like really sunny out right now and i just want to go in tan but i have duties i have things to do let me show you what we got first of all i met up with my mom and she brought me this package from home and its got a lot of fun stuff in it first of all a charlotte tilbury package charlotte tilbury send me pr i love them with a burning passion thank you charlotte tilbury if youre watching this right now so they sent me broad spectrum spf 50 sunscreen this is perfect because ive really been trying to take care of my skin more especially this summer ive been wearing this hat everywhere because i realized actually ill tell you this right now when i went to get my facial she told me that i have this thing called mel actually i dont know what its called but it starts with an m basically its a skin condition where whenever youre in the heat like even hot yoga which i didnt know which is concerning because ive done hot yoga over the past month now but when youre in the heat these pigmentations that are under your skin rise to the surface and i actually have like discoloration on like my eyes i actually hope that i dont look weird on camera because i went to sephora and i tested out foundation on this side of my face so if i do dont mind that but anyways ive been wearing a lot of sunscreen recently because im like i just dont want to age and get wrinkles and get like skin pigmentations when im like freaking 30 also got this beautiful skin sun kissed glow bronzer you can use this on your face and body and its infused with hyaluronic acid and vitamin d its huge oh my god oh i am so happy look how big this mirror is i love charlotte tilbury oh im in such a good mood can you see do i am like am i okay did you see how i was last night and they gave me this little bronzing brush she also made me a bunch of protein balls so thats epic theyre like cocoa oats protein balls she crocheted me a shirt look she even added beads shes a pro at freaking crocheting oh my god i love it okay its basically just a square but you tie this around your neck and like this around your body and its like a triangle i dont know were gonna try it out later okay from h m theres actually an h m home which is super epic because they have a lot of cute stuff i got this little picture frame i think im gonna put this in my office you can just slide a photo in there and i bought these that actually go on the wall and theyre again picture frames but since they all match i was thinking that they would just look really cute i also got this its a candle holder and you can stick candles in there if you guys remember i have these iridescent candle holders on my table yeah they both broke which is super unfortunate so maybe well switch it for this one or this will go on some sort of thing i also got this candle is sundried linen im gonna put this on my desk notes of clean cotton apple blossom and a comforting touch of white musk cute its kind of like a little bit of like light pink and i bought this pink tank top this is also adorable i was thinking i could like cut this and just like you know wear it in the summer i also noticed as i was leaving that they had matching pink shorts and im kind of like sad that i didnt buy the pink shorts and its 999 i got it in a small then from h m i got this white rug i think im gonna put this in my room i feel like its the perfect size its not too big or too small it was 79 dollars you guys are gonna see the room renovation as well but honestly im kind of going through a little bit of a dilemma where in my last bedroom it was super like pinterest inspired and that did really well on the internet like you guys ate that    up pinterest ate that    up but now im like a little bit older im like minimalism i actually dont want to have a ginormous mess everywhere i go then im like but it does better for the video and i know youre all gonna say do what you want dont do it for the video guys im a youtuber the more that i do stuff that you guys like the better it does for me because i get more subscribers i gain more views i make more money it all recycles in itself so obviously im going to pick whatever i want to do at the end of the day but im still taking in consideration what does well on the internet does that make sense im out of breath im hyped up right now im like do i need another energy drink i dont know i did have a coffee next week i told you im going to a trip to montreal and im not gonna actually ill tell you guys kind of what its about basically i have this super secret project thats coming out in august and ive been working on this for like almost a year now and its one of my biggest surprises yet when i tell you that im excited for this its not just like a little bit like im just like a little bit excited no i am stoked for this its going to be insane and basically im going to montreal to meet with the team and were going to do a photo shoot and like all this kind of stuff i just want my makeup to look flawless i feel like you know its not crazy of me to want to look my best when im away especially because theyre going to be in photos and its going to be like a big deal so basically i just bought a bunch of new makeup products to make my face makeup just look really good and just you know picture perfect i dont want to be taking photos and then regret that my makeup looks so bad to start off i got this milk hydro grip primer this is before you put on makeup and it makes it last all night then i got the giorgio armani luminous silk flawless foundation i heard lots of good things about this and i actually posted it on my instagram asking like whats a good flash proof foundation and a lot of people recommended this one i got the shape tape concealer ive heard so many good things about this concealer its by tarte im a big concealer girl because my under eyes are always so dark and i dont know how i havent tried this yet i know they didnt have in canada for the longest time so im really excited to try this i got this i actually had this before and it was really good so i know that it works well it is the mac prep and prime fix plus setting spray but its mattifying and i heard that apparently for flash photography matte is what you want to do i have so many points and look how epic this was with the beauty insider points and it was 500 points oh awkward i thought it was skincare and this is hair care it looks like this this i brought from urban outfitters and i was thinking this would be super fun to include in this video and to make a tick talk about it is this heatless curl set ive been seeing this all over tick tock and it looks kind of crazy it looks like this and you like put it in your hair you wrap your hair around it and you wear it overnight and its supposed to be perfect for heatless curls and because i have extensions in theyre super long and i feel like they would really work with this and also i cant keep using heat on my hair my hair is going to fry off and fall off yeah that was a ginormous haul

yes of course everything has jojos we look pretty stylish huh i think were ready to go and break some bricks now i am worried though because like yeah the movement a little stiff you know it doesnt always have to be the nice style it can be good i love these these are so good so this is where you can put your phone your wallet you just feel so badass just pulling things out like yes im a magician so how many tiles do you think youre going to be able to break girls record was like 20 something like that so youre going to break 20 if i can break well the records like 34 but i dont think im gonna break it three four maybe like 20 20 would be good who do you think would be best at out of the boys trustees voice me yeah joey always holds back you know i want to see joey go in today right enjoy going first arc yeah who do you think huh musically garnet right wow well see about that gone youve got a thing coming guys so were gonna get our stuff and im gonna head over now that we have our outfit were ready to go and smash some tiles my nerves were building and i wont lie guys i was kind of    myself i really really wanted to be good at this because im a monkey and all im good at is doing monkey things and monkey smash so are you good at physical exercise then or is it just i think im very good at it you know i got some experiences you know ken what is it what is this there is an aggress love hotel in japan why would you bring me here i dont want to go i wasnt gonna bring you here here oh its here ah that looks more like what you told me were gonna do that is the type of smashing that i expected and so these are the tiles that were gonna line up there and smash i mean you can smash something else like over there but ill take gaunt and joey to the love hotel to smash them oh my god is that my favorite youtuber c dog va see dog v8 we were just visiting the monkey magic cafe and i thought why not in my yucata smash some blocks you look so white i am incredibly white jay you want to explain what were doing today yeah cajo showed me some videos on youtube people smashing these tiles and filming it for like records so i thought why not see who can break the most out of all of us okay like bones or break the most top yeah bonus points for bones i guess the way that it works is that i thought we should do five then ten and then go up okay yeah im glad to know i can pay 20 bucks to break my hand its good on my channel so uh ripped my wallet today but lets see who can break the most wow that actually hurts its actually a break oh my god you want us to smash five of these 10 so the kind instructor said a male average is 10 the male averages im definitely not an average male 1 im a subpar beta male today after getting a chance to touch and feel the tile needless to say we were a bit unsure of our abilities so well for your safety im going to tell you how to do it first of all i have a question have you ever tried any martial arts like karate kung fu i did karate for three days when i was eight ive watched a lot of jackie chan films you watched yeah i mean what am i gonna do no its not since i was five i dont know being asian in the uk people would just assume right no no so no no no no no at first hans tell its called pitsy that means hammer in english okay clenching your face like this and using the side of your palm raise your arm then smash it away and you hit the tile with here yeah here the squishy part of your hand okay okay okay make one line in the air up two down straightly dont punch in through like that way stop your pinky fingers oh okay you can choose your stance uh in two ways this way or power up this way as you like i guess uh its easier to do it you can use your way too definitely that it is just up to you for your safety using uh two gloves yes two gloves so you need concentration gazing at the red circle then smash okay its quite simple yeah its yes yeah simple its simple if youre not shy you can yell before hitting like c this mans battle cries are legit to your neighbors mind never mind he didnt leave the place all right lets go whos out for us yeah youre here right right oh oh lets go thats an arm we had no expectations of how many tiles we could smash so we thought it would be a good idea to let cajo go first and set the bar low we found the lost jojo character and she sure did set the bar low that sounded like like a kid landing on a bed you know but cajo wasnt discouraged so easily so she wanted to have another shot in it oh two three no four three nice and so cow set the bar with three tiles being smashed i dont feel good i mean that was better than the first time obviously yeah at least you broke you broke half yay that was my record three congratulations i think a child could do that too youre really good at encouraging people you try i guess youve got to show us how its done show me your donkey kong power and of course being the monkey that i am you know i had to start screaming okay and because its my voiceover i can compliment myself as much as i want damn look at how clean that smash was donkey kong my father would be proud of me those tiles are disintegrated what the hell was that now that id comfortably set the bar at five it was joeys turn to try and replicate my results and joey comfortably smashed the five tiles with a ninjaesque strike precision all precision joey that didnt hurt at all actually yay all right gone your turn how hard did you hear that honestly like fifty percent also not to mention i actually didnt quite follow through either but i still got yeah i saw you just kind of like put this through i kind of just went yeah i literally just went next is gone and gods a little bit worried because hes just watched me and joey comfortably do this so if god cant hit these five tiles and smash through them comfortably its not gonna look good yeah you really do but needless to say that wasnt gonna stop gone because gant had a special shouting technique and this is to go even further unfortunately god didnt quite get the memo that you had to strike the tiles in the center and thus he only managed to break two i missed the center i knew it i missed the center so gand and cajo are currently tied what happened i actually i actually split like that but god wanted to prove himself and break three i called that competent that its impressive oh there you go there we go he got it he got it a clean strike that any 11 year old could replicate now any of my keyboard that looks really way more intimidating yeah now it was my turn to attempt 10 tiles im not holding back anymore guys im done all right but thanks to the power of jojo references it was but a simple task that was a good deep voice that was the most monkey move ive ever seen now that i had succeeded and set the bar at 10 it was joeys turn to try and catch up i really have to go down for this one okay see joey once again with an extremely clean strike hits ten tiles and destroys them comfortably gone wanting to redeem himself from his previous failure also wanted to try destroying ten tiles gods gone into monk mode i think gaunt driving and drifting a car was less serious than this alas three was his limit again for some reason god refuses to strike the center sadly leading to minimal tile casualties i feel much better power is just a bonus like if you just hit the right spot it does it for you gone wanting to prove once again that he knows what hes doing wants to break the remaining seven tiles that he has good luck gone oh god yet again did not hit the center for some reason thats an improvement thats four or four god improvement all of an improvement but god congratulations on your personal record of four tiles at least you beat caho in tiles are we worried if i do this because that means ive got to go higher youve got to go higher and now it was starting to get stupid it was my turn to attempt 15 tiles my heart is racing im nervous for you some poor japanese mans house im destroying here and needless to say i was a little bit nervous all right all right no unfortunately i just wasnt strong enough and i failed to break 15 tiles i should have gone through more so now we know your limit is 12 you can beat me jerry you have to beat me come on now im extra nervous joey had been performing cleanly it was his chance it was his moment to break 15 tiles even though it was a clean strike the power just wasnt quite there and joe was only able to break 10 tiles in the end still an amazing performance that    hurt you did 10 again again i did 10 again exactly 10 that really hurt my hand kaho seeing gods show of strength decided that she wanted one more chance at breaking five tiles cairo is going to try again because she wants to redeem herself miraculously kahu had did it she broke five tiles placing her above gods record of four all right im gonna head out that feels great so if you dont know joeys currently getting patched out because he got injured of course every time were together joey must get injured and you always break things which is why youre tailormade for this challenge the ground is like    from how much its been punched in all right i got this put in i didnt think it was gonna be this big im okay im okay after being inspired by cajos show of strength i wanted one more chance of breaking 15 i really thought i could do it final try if i failed this im a loser i was always meant to be a loser maybe we can just photoshop if i fail just cant see it just does like the top all right guys i have the power of god and anime on my side and somehow i managed to do it i have no idea how but damn did it feel good he got it you got it i seriously thought he was going to fail after that it felt like he just kind of like smoothly went yeah yeah whats the record 21 21 lets try it youre gonna try it how are you gonna do it why not lets do it so i had actually lied earlier we found out the record was actually 21 and if i got it id get my picture on the wall and you know i really wanted my picture on the wall for some weird reason the best case result would be you get you hit 20 and you just cant get that would be so sad its so sad but so good i got my picture on the wall so here it is 21 tiles and i dont know if it comes off appropriately in the video but it is massive and i genuinely dont think its humanly possible for me to be able to do this but you know im gonna try so here it is the record attempt if i can do this ill go down in history as a legend and if i fail another stupid foreigner try to break tiles all right you ready lets go no im not ready how am i ready for this this is your chance to make history connor lets just do it lets try and get this record boys try and get the trash taste record im so nervous go get rid of my nerves and unfortunately i couldnt quite get it but we were so close and i would try again but my hand is utterly dying at this point ive fallen and i cant get up damn it i got 14 oh you tried good good effort good afternoon youre not making history today its all right yeah maybe someone sorry with this car no car on a cash atm i hope you enjoyed this video because it cost me 500    dollars on tiles alone well thats the end of the video uh i need to put my hand on some ice i think joey join the club but i hope you enjoyed this video please dont forget to clown on guard in the comments for being weaker than cajo music dont forget to like comment and subscribe hit that notification bell and thank you todays sponsor uh just subscribe because videos expensive and i gotta go and pay the bill now five hundred dollars on tiles alone all right see you guys lets go home music you

glasgow who are on their way applause generations pass without experiencing a feeling like this the rangers have done it read 1961 67 72 2008 rangers are going to their fifth european final 50 years on from barcelona and dinamo moscow when rangers beat german opponents 31 in the semifinal in bayern munich and rangers are heading to seville back to spain by the wings of walter and with the spirit of jimmy bell in their hearts to honor those who forge the path and create new legends of their own this has been the most sensational european run ranges against all the odds from the laws of malmo to defeats in the opening two group games this is a squad that when they are asked to give their all boy do they do it and the hero of the hour is john lundstrom but out there in truth heroes to a man and rangers and scottish football will have a team in a major european final from the bottom from the deaths of the scottish leagues rangers are back on the grand grand stage the fulltime score at eight rock stadium rangers three rb light shake one thank you to rory and the team my goodness me my words rangers are in the europa league final rangers have done it seville rangers are coming and frankfurt will be their opposition ally mccoy and kenny miller next to me ally i can see it in your eyes the emotions what youve just gone through but what an achievement that is darryl im absolutely i cant tell you how proud im of that team are those players the fans everything about tonight ive been fortunate enough to come to this place and ive seen victories over by munich ive seen victories over dining who care ive seen victories over legionated where the atmosphere has been absolutely the best the best that tonight will take some beating that performance winstro fear me passing to a man every one of them should be so proud of themselves nine years ago for plenty stalin and the third division were in the european final nine years ago yesterday you were lifting the third division trophy rangers in the europa league final kenny put it into words if you can its important you know alice talks absolutely sensational that performance against a very very good team theyve went totally tall for the first whistle and theyve came out on top like they have done against dortmund against red star against bragg on this knockout stages theyve been absolutely phenomenal in this in this a lot of people said ali when rangers regained the title last season the journey back to the talk was complete but you know what maybe tonight its complete oh without doubt without doubt its all about stages and steps and the journey back last year last season was phenomenal itself to grow that campaign undefeated and win the title back that was immense but this darrow this tonight is just another level this is only the second its the second semifinal in 50 years were playing against the team one of the top teams in europe that dont spend 50 60 million pounds on players its unbelievable what those men have achieved tonight and as i said i am so proud for them tactically that man there got it absolutely spot on and you know something the world helped and i might as well tell you i wasnt too sure that some of the refereeing decisions today but you got it tactically spots on from broncos and a couple of things went against him arimos injury jacking off having no center forward no ramsay no roof i mean is that spirit or is that spirit what did you say to me ahead of the game you said walter would be with them tonight honestly its the first person ive thought of oh walter im joining up there applause because thats absolutely magic and its that kind of a night its that kind of emotion thats coming out i can see it from ali next to me i can see it in your eyes as well its always going to be that way you know i think with everything thats been on this weekend over the past months coming at a night like this like you say with a master minded something like that tonight

lot of spirit and a lot of ability its amazing what you can achieve thats a top team yeah get to these types of stages and these finals if you dont deserve it and that team out there really deserve it 100 kenny you can be lucky once or twice but you dont get to a final i mean look at the start as well in the campaign after two games i have rolling in the first half after two games would anybody really have thought that rangers would be in a european final did you think you would ever see this again no i didnt because whether we like it or not and i know a lot of the scottish clubs will think its going to happen to what im saying finance is just about everything nowadays in football it really is because you can go and spend money on the best players and i know rangers can do it domestically but to compete against the team by the way that beat manchester city this year and already scored three goals at the etihad theyre a top team you saw alan mcgregor they are celebrating he missed the final in 2008 through injury now he gets his chance and who knows who knows for him who knows what lies ahead what and into the season he has an incredible you know what it might be last hour you know you just never know is that a wonderful career he has and hes played his part of that he must have the final ac fully deserves it by the way so does every single one of them deserve out

pretty next level im worried now because like i im worried because they all have better fashion sense than me and i i i i im im scared that theyre gonna kill me and im worried im worried because look at foodie over there shes picking everyone shes being picky i think i look fabulous i got the boots i got the thing you know i got a little cute little hat on this is totally what fast feet would pick if she was right here but this is an icy fall oh you know what pause ugh this is a sweaty skin any skin that has the star wand i classify as a sweaty skin winter uses it and i will probably most likely kill you you say i saw someone with a star one then someone walked up and just stared at them for a second and theyre like your backpack was green i think youd know that see theyre passing off to other things and im kind of scared uh thats why i like that bro she just like skipped right past me so whos this person theres two of these skins and i dont really like matching skins so ones gotta live ones gonna die i feel like the sausage battling is like the skin and matches the skin so its like a family you cant kill the family goodbye cloud guys i dont know why but my heart right now is actually pumping oh cute braids i like that i like that its its a different element i like it dont know about the story itll be creative im actually worried my hearts like pumping here i could make up a story for this character easy like hey yeah thats disgusting laughter why would i want a teddy bear to win a fashion show the skin you didnt have anything pink not enough pink you passed because i let the other one pass oh my god i just dont want to look at you patrol lets go oh my god its a fashion show wait but flamingos like like nice long legs he wasnt in my ear youd be dead you know that youd be dead oh really oh i like it you have like kind of a magical vibe going with the backpack in there i have a feeling that person has the same skin as me thats cute let me show me your pickaxe

family we keep the hot guy whoa oh my god yeah you grinded for whatever that is its kind of purple but mixes of pink though so i i cant i cant be a hater oh no oh no this one i feel like ive seen before a lot less people a lot less people we love that as a first round we love that rest in peace to towny but winter hmongs still active to the next theme lets go with video games oh i cant choose chun li im not first were gonna sneak over to the side and uh were gonna load up our have my hand hitting the desk too hard if people want to come back i dont want to come back he will be out of the prize money but he can play for fun all right ill no ill do that obvious i just give it up now i picked everything that was just gaming related thats all i did she is 100 gonna kill me for just not making sense eliakis hes a gamer get out of the changing booths if youre stuck dont call me step fruity thats weird thats a really good one i really like him i feel like ive gone pretty unique with mine im looking around and im looking like im totally up my thing makes no sense few lara crofts next to each other and i cant kind of ignore this i think im dead they dont have a back blink that is such a shame you match the outfit the backlink and the pickaxe its like youve never seen a fashion show video which is fair ive never seen one either youre done what is that isnt it you know something about myself i do not like borderlands yeah i knew that anyway oh thank god i didnt picked it i was gonna pick the psycho first oh i actually didnt choose that because every time i wore that one i would play duals with luffy she would always like tell me to like get it off like straight away im a youtuber im the only youtuber here yeah im looking at you mr halo and you know im looking at you whats the backlink i dont know but it matches the pickaxe and i kind of respect that this skin and whenever someone does a gaming concept they put on this skin because its wearing a headset the truth is she actually works at a call center ah theres no way no theres no way ill win ill get through this um a microphone does he sing im a youtuber ellie elliott doesnt sing youre right oh my god a youtuber has microphones oh you cant believe it because hes recording were doing gaming youre not yeah hes a gaming youtuber what do you want from me i thought outside the box no you didnt you thought in the box i know because ive been punished for that same thing in a power video what viking alien like what is the crossover you know sir youve inspired me to do a fashion show where the worst person wins but unfortunately thats not this scary time what does a ball have to do with lara croft is gaming its an astronaut stud they dont have a creative mind these hosts astronaut was clearly among us not gaming not gaming that is an astronaut pickaxe is that i dont know i think thats the master chief pickaxe i dont know if im right were really trying to eliminate a bunch of people here but god damn it its hard am i going to survive this you probably will die but ill be back oh my god oh my god that was winter yes love it uh youre a big fan of rocket league arent you yeah yeah excellent little car what are those i dont remember rocket league having changed things actually transformed immediately transforms into cars and hes just like got a car back when he transforms into customers i dont mind this actually i dont mind this the soccer guy can go oh bye shes not an archer though you know thats just gaming inaccuracy i actually am so surprised that i actually survived that that should not have happened this skin and backpack and all that makes no sense but the first round i get killed even though my whole getup matched all right were gonna get a lot of people with the next round i think what about cute girls oh please fruity my heart dont mind if i do yeah hold on hold on cute what if they all just came out the same skin imagine that i think this girl is like probably one of the cutest ones that are in the whole list i dont think anyone went hurt i dont think anyone went my oh im unique im unique its out for me yeah this one out i dont like seafood oh hey dooley but whats up it matches her outfit the the pickaxes dont really is that just her entire set that looks like her entire set oh its not well then it looks like it matches on points yeah i think its very similar i think its about the pickaxes its like a its not its not the same but can you be quiet oh but she is commanding oh its very cute im feeling anything in there not really oh i feel on the theme with this one nice i love it love me we got here oh rainbow esque theme i dont mind that out this is the most confrontational pose i know but it matches her outfits so its cute oh yes okay okay okay okay i came back and she thought i was cute okay its like ive seen it dont shake your head at me or winter youre like the pickaxes matched rooney i mean is this tony its safe its safe so many more cute girls what is that thats cute lazy and the backpack kind of matches is it weird that im just like the ponytail is cute from the thing i like that i like that please dont kill me im cute im cute

supposed to protect us they throw it in the house like this they throw it they damaged it to hit us like they used it as a weapon how can you use the ganesh tea as a weapon throwing it inside the window music ill keep eyes up my video music or music um so they said they will put him to the jail anyone who will help us they will put in a jail because two girls give false statements false false false statement that arjun did harassment to anyone connected you know like we are not separated arjun is always with me and i know nothing ever happened i dont know whats going on in their mind why theyre hunting us tried to kill us that was an attempt to murder definitely they had knives they had stones they attacked us you can see in this recording they tried to steal our phones subscribers are making videos thank you till thank you that youre with us like the whole society is against us 30 people are outside there just waiting for us to come out im just sitting now in the house with the open door i will show you peanuts window broken here they broke the window this is the result of the plants there is a stone here you can see a stone that drew a stone inside i dont even know where they got this zone from um we have the sofa in front of the door because they broke the door they broke the lock everything is broken broken they broke our door they tried to come inside here 30 people 30 people tried to enter inside my house with knives with stones they were abusing on highest level they were life threatening us they were like telling us like threatening us like harassing us with lifethreatening black males and stuff um yeah and then when the police arrived after one hour we called for one hour the police after one hour they arrived first they didnt pick the call at all for 1020 minutes and we couldnt we are two people only we couldnt close that keep the door closed and they were coming with nice and everything god knows what could happen they even broke my ganesh my ganesh there is a ganesha in front of our house to take care of us music so now tell me is this indian culture throwing the ganesha inside my house breaking it using it as a weapon against me just because i abused which i did only because my life was threatened because someone attacks me with a hockey hockey stick and abuse me on deepest level so i cannot repeat those abuses its like am i wrong so this is the case at the moment we are now in the home so this police didnt even believe this in the beginning and he just came and he said switch off the camera i was live i recorded everything live and he was not believing us although i was crying and i was telling him what happened and he was not he was not even caring and he was just saying arjun has to come with him so arjun went with him for making a statement and they kept him there because these two girls made a false statement against him because of rape and harassment against two women and a woman like a girl like shes not a woman shes a girl like young so this is like on deepest level yeah nature really like why people do that because of a dog poop the whole story started with a dog our dog who pooped five meters away from their house on the opposite of the street why you come here 30 people waiting for us outside hunting us to our house throwing ganeshi inside our house and using it as a weapon against us throwing stones having knives in the hands putting the knives inside the window like breaking the window breaking the door yeah foreign okay thats next morning here uh arjun music to protect me in the house when there are 30 people outside trying to kill me or they cannot leave my family inside yes so because of the society manager who or management who has told the securities to not let anyone any visitor to help julie inside the society they are all following theyre all like on one side theyre all against me and no one wants allow people to help me they try to isolate me and not provide me any help although there are people out there my family friends and their lord they dont let anyone in they dont let anyone in this society to help me they want me to come out of the house and once i will be out of the house they will kill me this is like crazy and the embassy i called the embassy and they said like oh yeah youre julie uh we heard already about it um are you safe and i said no im not saved i said oh we have talked to the local police um but you should be safe and i said yeah but the local police is not with us the local police is with them local police is working under that judge definitely like they are not with us they are sitting there outside with the criminals and drinking chai and when i make a chai beer they dont take my child they dont have a word to me they are here to protect me but they are sitting there and providing the neighbors information about me about what im doing in the house and about all these things this is not like the police is not working for me its working against me in the name of working for me this is not right like this everything is not right im a human hannah im a human and i deserve help this is the night bar coming to the police giving them food and filming me filming their actions what im doing this is the nightmare working with the neighbors with the other neighbors giving them food giving them try giving them everything okay you see music music owner and the broker which also it was in connection with hamara purana society cassette control music the whole thing is so crazy like how these people can be all like work together like how they can be all doing this this is no anyways ill be updating arjun uh um on paper he is bailed out of the of the jail and he has to fill out documents now then well come home and he called me and he was asking if everything is all right and i said yeah everything is all right so i was asking him is everything all right and oh my god thats so dramatic its so crazy i would have never believed that this is happening anyways once arjun has arrived home i have a donkey i hope hes well and i hope they treat him well in i feel so bad for him i could not sleep all night long i was thinking like you know how much he must suffer like im lying in a comfortable bed and im with people like with my friends and he is alone in this place and i dont know maybe they hit them maybe maybe they didnt give him food like music i feel so bad for him and in the night i was literally falling asleep because i was dead tired and i was falling asleep and then i woke up and i kept on dreaming that these people are entering the house i kept on dreaming that you know that they are coming here and and and killing us it was a horrible night so this two police guy quebec file here and they are walking now to their house to provide them the filing information music
vaIgyRoUkQI,i didnt eat food for 30 days,Food,i am not eating any food for the next 30 days wait want to be hungry this is what i currently look like and i weigh 220 pounds and when i say no food i really mean it this was the hardest ive ever pushed my body in my entire life seriously do not try this at home i had a whole team of doctors watching me every single day they kept track of all my vitals like these to ensure i didnt have a heart attack or worse thanks doctors and if i for any reason eat food in the next 30 days chris you get to shave my head no theres no way hes going to 30 days were shaving his head the challenge has officially begun guess you wont need these music youre right and since im not eating for the next 30 days i might as well get rid of all the food in my house or are you eating im not or are you im not eating and can you guys help me get rid of all this food where is he its like legit take all my food i dont want a single calorie of food in this house give me a question if a fly flies into your mouth because your mouth is open and you accidentally swallow it does that count as eating uh probably yeah were that serious enjoy the food ill see you guys later you forgot the cheetos tomorrow say it to the door all right the challenge is now getting serious the boys are gone and my kitchen is completely empty also chris accidentally broke my microwave the microwave were broke thanks a lot chris im laying in bed about to go to sleep and it feels weird not having a snack before bed staying strong ill see you guys tomorrow typically when i wake up the first thing i do is i go eat breakfast but obviously i cant do that now so i guess i just go film videos the only thing going in my mouth for the next 28 days is water lets go see how much weight ive lost to be honest i probably weigh basically the same yeah like i said and im about to go start filming a different video so todays gonna be a pretty difficult day and the video were filming is were seeing if this man can spend 100 days in this circle comment what you think is harder spending 100 days in a circle or not eating food for 30 days building on a completely empty stomach is much harder than it sounds by the end of it i was drained thats probably like four or five hours of filming and honestly man i need to go to bed im tired now hey chan chan what you got there oh just some mcdonalds im blowing the smells your way you are jimmy you want to eat me its the end of day number two not gonna lie im actually really hungry and uh yeah ill see you guys tomorrow a lot of people say that days three through six are the hardest but for the most part i feel fine im just a little sluggish and i just feel tired taking my first poop since i started fasting how much do i weigh so im down two and a half pounds in the last day thats actually pretty crazy but it does make sense because i took a giant poop this morning were about to do a photo shoot for my snack brand festivals and it sucks because i cant eat them and this is making me hungry thats me smiling through the paint you need me to take a bite of this yes they want a photo of me taking a bite of the bar can i have permission ill spit it out i promise yeah you can do that its the picture you can have a shape i hate you all right im hanging up fake biting chocolate this morning i was like im not that hungry this isnt too hard now im like bro i need to eat food the boys told me they have a surprise for me which is basically a nice way of them saying theyre about to torture me we just rented an ice cream truck because we want to shave jimmys head oh im sorry all right lets go yeah i hear music outside and now theyre screaming my name oh my gosh hey hey we got ice cream did you use my credit card for this of course we did what would we use our own money of course screw you guys it just clicked in my head that these goofy goobers are gonna be trying to tempt me this entire time theyre literally throwing ice cream at my window oh my god did you guys just break the window jimmy jimmy watch out for the broken glass and the ice cream you guys do realize im renting this from a friend hey jimmy cat did you guys have fun we have one more little trick oh one more of course let me guess you ordered pizza okay get out of here come on oh you guys go merry christmas happy hanukkah the boys smashed a window and it doesnt seem safe to sleep in a house with an open window i decided to just sleep over at a friends house its the morning and i woke up with a headache doc said it should go away within a day or two its pretty normal so yeah im probably not gonna do much today despite that i managed to drag myself to the weighin set turns out i lost another half a pound good progress anyways back to bed for the rest of the day today is day five im going to check with the doctor check on the guy in the circle film some tick tocks and then figure out how i buy a private island for 100 million subscribers all right i weigh 2122 pounds i lost another three pounds in the last 24 hours where does it go bro i dont know we should find it currently im getting blood work done to prove to you guys and chris that i havent eaten the main thing im going to be looking for is a hormone called leptin will tell me whether youre eating or not were going to take a couple days to come in well await the results today is day number six and for whatever reason im feeling really good i dont want to get cocky because i still have 24 days left but im starting to think this is actually possible you guys know the deal 2101 pounds well were on 210 exactly wow this is bitcoin this year and now its time to go check on the guy we trapped in the circle were filming the 100 and circle video and after talking really loud for a long time im very tired so im gonna just take a nap probably so i did take a nap in this guys house and then we finished filming need anything else yeah i think im good see you in a week a week its currently midnight and the boys asked if i wanted to hang out theyre all just nominated im not gonna lie in this moment i am contemplating shaving my head so i can eat some nachos those look really good you can good morning jim how you doing im doing phenomenal because its officially been a week since i ate food and what better way to celebrate this milestone and then some ice balls ah this was a lot funnier in my head after seven days without food cut me some slack this next shot is brought to you from the side because tariq didnt hit record oh my gosh im down almost 12 pounds since we started in only a week day 7 was really busy first i did my vital check at the studio bad bad who left these laying around what is so bad dont you eat it for me let me just watch you eat this oreo this is sensational then i checked out some inprogress sets from an upcoming video and finally me and carl filmed with quackity for the rest of the day well i dont understand how this constitutes as a talent mental toughness is a challenge i havent ate food in seven days this challenge is definitely starting to wear me down so um one of our coming up videos were thank you truck what i was trying to say is the chocolate factory set was being built and i wanted to show you this is a chocolate fountain and thats how much chocolate it requires to fill it bro being around these candies are making me so hungry why did we have to film this during my fast the boys sent me a random dm saying theyre playing basketball its probably a horrible idea but screw it i literally airballed my first shot hes definitely a lot less energetic making less shots i didnt realize how weak i was from not eating but despite that i still managed to score a little so funny story i just pooped and thats significant because this was my first poop in over a week so i did some googling and apparently this is a normal thing not gonna lie it feels so weird to poop again i was recording some videos for the react channel and it really just it drained me man its almost jimmy jams nap time he gets low on calories im low on the energies i also just didnt sleep that well last night when i can barely keep my eyes open im on a couch in the studio and im literally just sleeping on day 10 i flew out to new york to meet with mark roberts music on a stage in front of a bunch of very important people and im tired of having food i didnt know scientifically possible to survive that long without food but back home the boys had their own plans while jimmys in new york tariq led us into his house and weve been filling it with food all day ive been eating all day stop okay music music the talk went great and im exhausted im going to bed when jimmy gets back from new york guys hes not going to know what hit him but it was us hes definitely going to eat and then we get to shave his head team us hello hey jim hey listen i can explain are you in on this i filmed it oh it smells so good in here please tell me it was just down here my bed bro how badly do they want to shave my head my face having chandler what is this youre hungry yes actually my stomach pain went away for the most part but now its throbbing did you turn kevin on the toilet seat no and because you said that im not going to them im in a chocolate factory watching people eat chocolate its been 12 days since i approved 13 12 i dont even know what day and the day only got worse from there i was so nauseous that i couldnt film for more than 20 minutes without sitting down for a break oh my god im gonna throw up at one point i almost scrapped the chocolate factory video because i was so low energy and by the end of the day i felt like i was gonna pass out so we had to check with the doctor im getting pretty low in energy so im gonna talk to the doctor and see what we should do i think we should shave your head and then you can eat and then youll feel that it is actually kind of tempting right now i really am hungry your hormone levels came back and it shows you are doing good with your fast i believe you i saw you sleep eight times today its definitely starting to catch up to me your electrolytes still look good but im a little bit concerned about your energy level when you start to feel worse we can always break the path for your um yeah we can break the hair off of your head and this is why you need medical supervision when you do these long fast i dont know what im doing im listening to him good night man well see you on chocolate factory tomorrow i had to fly out on day 13 so i weighed myself from home thats 18 pounds under where i started in just two weeks were heading to vegas to film a quick clip with gordon ramsay all this flyings really starting to catch up to me

WLXQQjHTE9I,top 20 new games of 2022 second half,Game, narrator so weve covered rhythmic music the first half of the year 2022 and now were looking towards the future the second half of 2022 and some of the most anticipated game releases now heres a roundup of 20 games keep in mind that release dates are always subject to change especially lately we always see delays and we can still also get some surprise game announcements you never know but for now lets get started off with number 20 evil west is a game where i just gotta throw objectivity out of the window this is exactly the type of game i want just a video game is hell video game and i mean that as a compliment this is a kind of scifi western third person shooter action game its just a linear adventure that you progress through and you are like a superhero cowboy man you deal with a six shooter and youre blowing away bad guys specifically vampires yes the wild west has been taken over by hordes of vampires and its up to you to use your gadgets your six shooters but also this cool lightning fist gauntlet to like punch them it just looks ridiculous and fun and gory and just what the doctor ordered sometimes it reminds us of something from the 2000s to 2010s and were really looking forward to it its releasing on all the major consoles september 20th 2022 now next over at number 19 we have high on life this is the justin roiland squanch games newest game so if youre into rick and morty and that style of humor and wackiness this might be right up your alley this is a scifi first person shooter where the different guns all have different alien personalities and im not gonna lie it just looks like a ton of fun it seems like theyve got some talented comedians and voice actors behind a lot of the roles and it just looks like a breath of fresh air something different you know squanch games for the longest time now has been pumping out cool projects they did some cool vr stuff but now theyre getting their hand at a full seemingly pretty big budget game it looks ambitious and it looks funny most importantly high on life is releasing october 5th 2022 for pc and xbox next over number 18 we have the lord of the rings gollum now this is a game specifically focused around gollum creeping around middle earth doing sketchy things its not necessarily based on the movie if you could tell by the art style theyre going for a little bit of a different look for the character and the game is focused around you making decisions as gollum or sméagol you know the voices in his head but also trying to mostly avoid combat because hes pretty weak through stealth its not often these days that we get a good solid stealth game anymore just truly dedicated to it so were curious to see how this pans out he seems pretty nimble he can get around the environments pretty quickly but the jurys still out on the quality of this one weve seen some game play trailers that dont look so hot but we cant help but just like lord of the rings and weird strange lord of the rings games that show us a different side of middle earth so were still keeping our eye on it it releases september 1st 2022 for all the major consoles now next over at number 17 we have stray yes this is the cat game thats the best way to describe it stray essentially is like a third person cat adventure game where youre a lone cat stuck in a seemingly abandoned dystopian futuristic city where all the humans are gone but there are robots living there you adventure through as this cat with a little drone friend you met a climbing exploring solving puzzles running from danger interacting with the locals and actually doing cat stuff like scratching on a wall or knocking stuff over just kind of being a jerk i mean no disrespect to cats i really like them and im looking forward to playing this weve talked about this one quite a bit already so well move on but stray is releasing for playstations and pc on july 19th next over at number 16 we have marvels midnight suns this is firaxis games take on a marvel game and its going for some darker material but also teaming up some really cool characters like wolverine and ghost rider and dr strange to take on a new enemy and its in a top down kind of strategic xcom style what this studio really specializes in theres sort of a card system in terms of choosing your moves and your attacks and i think the gameplay can just make for some really fun and challenging spots if youre into xcom or any type of strategy game like this im really hoping they nail it but im just looking forward to the story and really seeing these characters in their full glory again blade hulk venom wolverine all in the same game im in as of right now marvels midnight suns is releasing october 7th for all the major consoles next over at number 15 we have skull and bones this is ubisofts long dormant title finally resurfacing this year and finally releasing and what it is is a pirate adventure game you make your own pirate captain you wander around ports in third person you customize you loot you sell you trade you hop in your ship command your crew and go on adventures and engage in naval combat youre doing it either alone in a single player campaign or with a group of friends which is where the probably a lot of the fun is gonna be had if youve played anything like sea of thieves you know manning a ship with a bunch of other people can be a blast this is a little bit of a different spin on things compared to sea of thieves and im curious to see how it pans out well know in the fall when it releases november 8th for all the major consoles next over at number 14 we have splatoon three its incredibly awesome to see this franchise return once again with new competitive modes seemingly a bigger open world single player adventure and of course lots of creativity the multiplayer in splatoon games can get incredibly addictive and im really curious to see how theyre gonna expand upon it this time were still waiting to hear a lot more for this but we know this holiday season were definitely gonna be playing it on nintendo switch cause it releases september 9th next over number 13 we have saints row yes saints row has been completely rebooted they drop the numbers and now its saints row you build up your own new criminal from the ground up with a pretty detailed character creator and you are set loose on a new kind of deserty las vegas type city at first i was a little skeptical and curious to see if they would actually retain some of the craziness that they really set up with some of the last games but nope it seems like all the insane hijinks are going to ensue you can glide around the city you could explode helicopters with bazookas jump out of cars and run around in your underwear thats really all ive really cared about with saints row games i just hope they keep it super dumb and super fun hopefully it doesnt feel lifeless well have to judge it when we get our hands on it its releasing august 23rd 2022 for all the major consoles next over at number 12 we have pokemon scarlet and violet these games are following up pokemon legends archeus with what you would expect like a more traditional pokemon game but in this new wide open fully 3d formula as youve probably seen from the game play trailers some of the exploration and everything looks really promising not too much to say about this one yet other than that technically its the first installment in the ninth generation of pokemon game series and its gonna be keeping some of us busy on switch november 18th 2022 now next over at number 11 we have atomic heart now this awesome creative bioshock inspired like alternate history soviet scifi thing is really just unlike any other adventure weve seen and weve been hooked on this one and anticipating this one for a while now so many games have been hit with delays so as of right now atomic heart doesnt have a rock solid release date but its still slated for the fourth quarter of 2022 at the time of making this video so we wanted to highlight it we really hope to see it this year but if it doesnt make it this year and really any game on this list we dont want them to rush take your time make a good game now next over at number 10 we have overwatch 2 overwatch 2 has been in the works for quite some time and as of recently a lot of people have been able to experience it with the pvp beta there is a lot going on with overwatch 2 specifically if youre more of a hardcore fan youll appreciate the nuances and what theyre gonna offer most particularly a new character who seems pretty cool theres definitely still a lot more news to come out about this one we do know that it is now going to be a free to play release which definitely makes things interesting overwatch 2 is releasing october 4th of this year now next over at number nine we have xenoblade chronicles 3 two is absolutely awesome its one of my favorite switch jrpgs ever so im really looking forward to three if you dont know its an action jrpg with open world exploration and tons of rpg stuff like questing character building and party members to build out these games have a lot of personality a lot of heart good character depth and good solid moments and a good amount of style specifically with the battles if its anywhere near as good as two i think thats a win and if it surpasses it that would be pretty awesome its releasing july 29th 2022 on nintendo switch next over number eight we have scorn this long awaited game finally has a release date and its just definitely not your typical first person shooter i mean if this is the first time youre seeing gameplay of it yes it is very unique it is incredibly deeply inspired by h r giger h r giger style art the guy the artist who created a lot of the initial concepts and designs for the original alien film so its got some creative kind of bio organic horror elements to it and it looks like it could be very cool to explore these worlds graphics seem pretty intense were still not totally sure what the deal is with game play how much of its really shooting how much of it is just exploration and puzzle solving but in terms of the atmosphere the vibe they got it on lock this one has been a long time coming and we hope its worth it well be checking it out on pc and xbox october 21st 2022 now next over at number seven we have call of duty modern warfare 2 thats right theyre making a call of duty again can you believe it never in a million years would i expect to see another call of duty game im kidding im sorry but i actually really liked modern warfare specifically the campaign the graphics were great the action was pretty crazy so if they could do that again and have some compelling multiplayer itll probably be a win i mean i know call of duties are just automatic wins for some people they just go out and buy them every year but the series always kind of needs a shake up and maybe this will be it we dont know too much about the game yet itll probably start getting revealed more soon but as of the time of making this video we just know its releasing for all the major consoles october 28th next over at number six we have gotham knights this is an action game in an open world gotham where you can play as knight wing batgirl robin or red hood so in this story wise batman is dead but the city is still just as screwed as ever so its up to the bat family to come together and fight against some cool villains some of which we havent seen in games before like the court of owls combat looks to be sort of batman arkham style but a little bit different a little bit more focused on like two players playing together and using their moves together though they have clarified that you can play this completely single player im excited for this one just as like a hardcore batman comic fan im excited to see what they can do with these characters but the combat so far doesnt look as smooth as it could be but again the jurys still out we have to actually play it we have to feel it in our hands and were going to do that i still think the concept on paper is pretty cool teaming up maybe online with another player to play cooperative and cruise around on bat cycles through an open world gotham fighting crime like that sounds pretty awesome and the story could be pretty cool but well just have to wait and see thankfully after them making this and teasing it for many years we finally hopefully get to play it without any more delays october 25th of this year now next over at number five we have crisis core final fantasy vii reunion yes theyre basically remaking ish crisis core for all those final fantasy vii hardcore fans and this is an incredible story that was not experienced by enough people that really can probably have a new opportunity to shine here im curious to see how this is going to tie in with the final fantasy remake games but if you want more final fantasy youre definitely going to get it with a game like this ooh boy got cool music cool combat cool characters memorable moments and it seems like its gonna be coming out this year square enix announced that its coming to all the major consoles including xbox this winter next over at number four we have the callisto protocol this is what i said at the start of this video just another video game as video game its straight up a single player fun action narrative adventure heavily inspired by dead space in a lot of ways its a spiritual successor to dead space because some of the people that worked on that are working on this game we always need more survival horror games we always need more tense brutal scifi games so were all signed up for this one theres not too much more we can say if youve seen the game play you pretty much get what it is straightforward third person tension in dark atmospheric space stations thats all we want baby so the callisto protocol is releasing on all the major consoles december 2nd 2022 now down to number three we have a plague tale requiem which is the follow up to one of my favorite games a plague tale innocence this is a single player action adventure narrative where you play as amicia trying to escort her special brother hugo through a plague infested world however the stakes are definitely higher this time around with amicia growing up into more of a badass it seems like there is more combat more of a threat and hugo himself has also developed some interesting characteristics if youve played the first game you know what i mean the first game was incredibly fun beautiful gory depressing nasty and unique so were hoping that the second game can really top that its releasing october 18th 2022 now down at number two we have hogwarts legacy this seems to be the harry potter game that a lot of people have been waiting for this is essentially a game where you create your own student you choose what house youre in and you go on some sort of cool magical wizarding adventure this is kind of a prequel to what we know of harry potter it takes place many many many years before voldemort or anybody and the potential seems there obviously for harry potter fans but for us were looking at something like maybe something to fill the void of like the fact that we never got a bully sequel the idea of a game where you go on adventures in the world of this school while also having to do some classes the only other thing we have like that is a persona game but in terms of that other type of feel you know were looking forward to hogwarts legacy for that weve seen some game play it does look pretty impressive but we still have a lot of questions that need answering still were looking forward to checking it out when it releases holiday 2022 for all the major consoles now down to number one you guessed it of course its god of war ragnarök were really really excited for this follow up to kratos and atreus first adventure it seems like now after the events of the first or rather the new saga the god of war 2018 game the events of that game the ramifications are seemingly coming home to roost here with freya seemingly being more of an antagonist and thor possibly being involved he was teased when this game was first announced so were excited to see where this goes it looks like bigger worlds more detail more combat options but for us to be honest like it might sound silly but were just really looking forward to seeing where this story goes cause god of war 2018 was absolutely beautiful if youre just looking for cool stuff or a heartwarming story about a father and a son theres kind of something for everybody as much as thats a cheesy phrase its for real dude so were really looking forward to god of war ragnarök and seeing where it takes things and its releasing for playstation november 9th 2022 those are the games were really looking forward to but of course weve got more that we couldnt fit in the list so the first is the last of us part 1 remake of the original game also sons of the forest the follow up to the forest finally seems like its dropping this year sonic frontiers is also seemingly dropping this year were looking forward to seeing how that one shakes out also outlast trials as of the time of this video we dont have a date but were hoping to see this year also soul hackers 2 like we said those are the games were looking forward to but there are so many more that we couldnt fit on this list from indies to just other weirder games so let us know what youre looking forward to if you learned about a new game or this helped you out in any way click and a like buttons all you gotta do it really helps us out but if youre new consider subscribing because we put on videos every single day either way thanks for watching and well see you guys next time

and revenge the quote clarissa shields the silence assassin savannah marshall two elite unbeaten champions colliding for the undisputed middleweight title just take that in and for ben it must be a dream come true and theres more its incredible this has to be the biggest story in womens boxing all sport needs the greatest rivalries you see it with nadal federer max verstappen lewis hamilton and now for womens boxing we have savannah marshall and marisa shields this is also going to be the biggest night in womens boxing history we have an allfemale card for the first time ever i want to thank our friends at top rank for providing an unbelievable chief support and michaela mayer against alicia baumgardner and it will be live on sky sports at the 02 for everyone not on box office as many people thought a huge investment by boxer and sky into womens boxing on what will be a huge night for boxing i think were going to see a different audience a bigger audience and an audience that boxing probably hasnt seen before and its all down to these two putting it all on the line elite athletes at the top of their game with a story that spans over 10 years lets get straight to the fighters clarissa welcome back to britain again you lit up cardiff you were there in newcastle as well and back you come to london where of course you struck gold in 2012 just after the one defeat on the slate to savannah marshall how much is it burning inside you to write what you think is a wrong it means a hello hello it means a lot to be here im grateful that the uk fans have accepted me you know once again to come over here and fight um savannah marshall she got lucky in 2012 but she wont get lucky in 2022 what do you mean she got lucky do you think it was just an aberration on your slate on your record i was 17 also london was hosting the olympics and they also favored her i never scored eight points in any of my fights leading up and that was the point system and then all of a sudden i scored eight just scored 30 points the day before as i did every other fight and then all then all of a sudden against her i only scored eight points versus her 14 i was 17 she couldnt shake me she didnt drop me she didnt get an account but all of a sudden now shes a knockout puncher youve sparred together as well but its more of the sparring outside the ring in recent weeks months is there a genuine dislike almost a hatred for savannah at this stage i dont hate nobody but i really do have a huge dislike for her my grandmother told me not to use the word hate so i wont use it but i dont like her and shes one of my biggest haters so this is for you the most important thing in your career to date thats what theyre making it as you know theyre saying that you know shes you know a big knockout puncher shes the only blemish on my record as an amateur and she has the you know she has the recipe to beat me so my job is to show everybody in the world that she doesnt and that i dont reign supreme for no reason in three different weight classes because if she was the one that was really supreme she would be champion three different weight classes and not me savannah youve been knocking everybody out theres no doubt about the power that you possess and the talent thats come to fruition in the last couple of years under peter fury with this chemistry do you feel now is the moment the time for you to become the undisputed middleweight champion i do yeah this fight has has been a long long time coming but were here now and september the 10th i will be the new undisputed middleweight champion of the world and what is it about clarissa obviously theres the the decade of of history is there jealousy that she went on to become a double olympic champion and the world titles at different weights and that youve had to struggle harder what is it or is there as clarissa said a dislike not a hate what is there from your side savannah no not at all im a im a fan of crystal shells what shes done for the sport is amazing shes a pioneer for the sport but the reality is she doesnt beat machine and she didnt perform she won again and thats what it is and it kills her look look it absolutely burns inside what burns inside the fact that i beat you and ill beat you again it burns inside of you that i got two olympic gold medals and you have zero thats why you kept begging for the fight thats why you oh i can be there what else have you done to sell yourself what have you done in your career besides brag about beating me 10 years ago ive knocked out people you went 10 rounds with no one you fought was elite you know no one you fought was elites they were good people hannah rankin was your best opponent who else was your best opponent name im not saying that weve boxed the same people that didnt go the distance from me but this year okay three years after after the skipper skipped the ring oh yeah and you havent improved who havent improved you havent improved since femme care please stop you declined 2012 thats why you never won nothing else after and i neglected it no world championship oh one i belt five belts over there you got one itll soon be over yeah itll soon be oh please you youre not gonna beat me youre not gonna beat me im just gonna beat you im gonna box you im gonna now youre gonna youre gonna outbox me or knock me out pick one im gonna hurt you and im gonna out box ya thats two for you youre not gonna knock me out and youre not gonna beat me im gonna hurt ya and im gonna out box ya are you gonna knock me out im gonna hurt you and im gonna box it all in you know it doesnt sound like a knockout to me she has got a lot of knockouts on the record do you think people arent making enough about your power as well as your speed and skills clarissa thats okay because speed is power shes slow as hell we all know that watch the fight with her and femke both of them didnt even land barely and then she lands a big hook because femkes like hey hit me hit me and then you landed the hook and knocked her out youre not gonna be able to hit me with that she was asking you for ten rounds couldnt do that absolutely caught weight like you didnt need her two in the cartwheel the red beater she was in the nighttime if youre 11 knocked out hannah rankin you wasnt gonna win she beat you four rounds you knocked out in the eighth you lost four yeah yeah i remember yeah she was winning right before i broke a jaw and peppered there oh please oh not now you breaking jaws you know up in the amateurs your record was 60 and 16 zero knockouts why are we out low six in 2022 no no because amateurs matter to you the olympics matter right the olympics and the emergence matter i was 77 wins one lost 19 kos you had how many losses you heard what i said no just tell everyone again and then you heard what i said how many losses you heard what i said tell them again two olympic gold medals how many losses though 12 world titles yeah there we go three divisions exactly you cant you cant do nothing that i do nothing you can sit here and talk but youre not going to win september 10th but she did beat you once before if the amateurs matter sure it is tell us about that savannah because clarissas sort of dismissing that is that important here mentally that you have won over on her not to me because im a better fighter you get a better fighter why you dont have 12 world titles i will september the 10th how do you feel about coming to london again obviously good memories but its not in america youre doing this youre coming over here is that to prove a point that youre the global superstar of this sport absolutely thats what its about im not worried about coming over here and fighting ive done it my whole career i can leave the country and fight she cant do that she would never go to the us and fight against me or any other top woman fighter in the us everybody got to come over her if it was up to her wed be fighting in her hometown newcastle but youre not savannah youre coming to london so youre taking yourself out of the comfort zone as well because youve built such a following now in the northeast i have yeah but its in the uk simply because chris doesnt sell a ticket that is why its in the uk and its in the road too not factual not factual ive sold out the board when i fought for undisputed cameras i have fought in verona new york where i sold out there stop it stop with the hope that i dont that that im not a draw because we are not here about to fight in front of 80 000 because you won one belt please stop its the auto were not here because you want one better where are you good were here because were in the gym thats why were here im the quote nobody knows you every time i speak of you you get bigger after this youre to have about 20 30 000 more followers because im here not because of nothing youve done how important savannah is it for you on september the 10th to be leading this incredible night for womens sport michaela mayer a chief support in a unification theres other great female fighters who are going to be added to the card how important is that a moment a landmark for boxing its amazing not just for me inclusive headlining but also the amazing fight in mckayla and alicia that alone i think thats a headline around its own um so itll be sharing the sharing the night with them too its going to be unbelievable and michaela of course is close to you clarissa and it it must be an honor for both of you really that this is happening um yeah of course im happy that theres another under you know another championship file in the car especially me and women me and michaela went to the olympics after the world championships together and alicia live not not even 45 minutes from where i live so im actually a good im a good friend of hers too but to have those girls and have their rivalry to be on this same card is just big for womens boxing and now i can say that this is one of the biggest fights in womens boxing because were fighting in front of 80 000 we have a great comain with the women and theyre going to be more women added to the card a ben spice needle aplenty you can just feel the tension up here every time every time i mean its taken so much to get this fight on i would like to thank the promoters on both sides so often in boxing the big fights just dont get made people said this fight wouldnt happen its happening its been going on 10 years i think its 2012 when savannah won her world championship goal it was 2012 when clarissa shields won her olympic gold thats where the story started that was when women for the first time would keep competing in the olympics and now were here ten years later at the o2 headlining the o2 live on sky sports on an allfemale card with possibly it has to be the greatest story that the sport has seen its unbelievable and i cant believe its its ten weeks away its a great story isnt it with the history the rivalry and of course weve seen a fantastic fight this year already in new york with katie taylor and amanda serrano its amazing whats happened that finally its its about great boxing matches and these women are in just wonderful wonderful position now and its a chance for sky sports to really showcase them on september the 10th how many times do we not see the best fight the best when theyre in their prime savannah marshall is in her prime larissa shields is in their prime and we get to see it and i just have to thank them because they are putting it all on the line theres a lot on the line here theres all the belts but theres a history theres the legacy and its happening at the o2 and for clarissa to come over here as well what a night for uk boxing everyone thought this was landing on box office everyone thought this was the first womens payperview event but the fact is ive got to thank all the promoters weve got to thank sky and weve put the our money where our mouth is because weve put it on we think this is going to grow the sport massively not just the womens sport but boxing in general um and yeah thank you to both teams and working alongside top rank as well whove provided some fantastic fights for us in the last year and lets bring in dmitry salita from team clarissa shields dimitri wonderful to see you great fighter of course great promoter now and weve talked about this now for i dont know how long but its finally happening can you believe it and how excited are you personally to be back here im very excited first of all i want to thank you i want to thank sky i want to thank ben shalom this fight has literally been a year in the making and for us as a team years in the making so im very happy that were here clarissa is not only known as the goal because shes a twotime olympic gold medalist multitime amateur boxing world champion threedivision professional world champion twodivision undisputed world champion but because of what shes doing right here shes traveling thousands of miles away from her hometown from her home country coming to avenge the only loss of her career when she was 17 years old it could have been forgotten about but its been on her mind forever because she is the growth and one of the things that i found out being in the uk last time is that the boxing fans here are phenomenal and i know that they will appreciate clarissas clarissas aim and goal to be the best and to challenge yourself and to get out of our comfort zone of the united states and to come out here and and avenge their only loss youve got a great team with john david jackson mark tafford of course as well youve got a lot of fighters too dimitri youve had great successes but how proud and privileged are you to be representing this lady and what shes achieved and done not just for boxing the most proud i really believe that clarissa shields is a generational athlete that in 20 years from now is going to be mentioned along the lines of jackie robinson muhammad ali michael jordan the greatest athletes pele the greatest athletes that transcended their sport what she has done has never been done shes the first woman to ever headline a premium on premium cable network television which was on show time it was only her second professional fight her fights were always sold out she broke records in terms of television viewership and on some of her events as well as the gate so shes shes extreme i believe that the reason why savannahs here and the reason why many of the other women are getting the respect they deserve is really because of the success of clarissa shields because clarissa has done something that has never been done before shes from flint michigan which is one of the most challenged places in the united states and as a little kid before boxing was a womans business before womens boxing was a business she made a choice not to go hang out not to get influenced by all different things in the community but to go to the gym and to be the best and to strive to be the best and as a kid to have that dream and to have that goal and to now accomplish it and sit here and this press conference is streamed on sky espn all over the world is really incredible and really clarissa is is not only an american here shes a hero of the world and what she has done for not only womens boxing for womens sports for womens rights is really incredible and i am very grateful and very honored to be part of this incredible journey finally for now dimitri its going to be a wonderful event isnt it on september the 10th this all female card its a real message isnt it to to sport to life in general to where weve all come and where these fantastic women are now on this platform to be seen and showcased and believe you me skye going to get behind this so much were very grateful all the respect and the honor that we received last time we were here and this time i see that the build up is of a true bonafide championship highlevel championship fight and its a great point that you brought up about women being on the card you know clarissa herself every time shes full she said dimitri lets put a woman on the card and throughout her career weve always had on the undercards championship fights four round fights six round fights the last fight we did during covert was an allwomens payperview in flint michigan so its been clarissas goal to always raise the sport of womens boxing and its quite amazing that there is such a rivalry where sports fans and boxing fans are really going to get behind it and but this event is is not only a great boxing event its a great sporting event its a great cultural event and at the right time and with the right partners in sky and ben and im very grateful for this opportunity and its going to be a fantastic night of boxing on september 10th i cant wait as a boxing fan i cant wait its a pleasure to have you guys with us lets get down to the other end peter fury uh many people peter see you as the man thats brought savannahs confidence her talent everything together theres a chemistry between the pair of you since youve started working together its been nothing but success after success and you can just feel it and see it with everything that savannahs achieving firstly how proud are you to have had that effect on this wonderful fighter yeah im very proud of savannah im so proud of what she does and everything about it really you know shes the fighter shes got the talent im just somebody that giving her advice we do the best we can so uh you know im a realist i dont talk to fighters i dont fighters if its wrong its wrong its right its right and shes a phenomenal fighter and this is uh this time shes in there right to be here shes well earned her right to be here and you know and clarissa shields as well you know shes a top fighter and this is a great fight and you know full respect for coming over here but you want legacies thats what they do if savannah comes out on top of this fight and theres a rematch in america savannah will do a training camp over here and somebody else can step in the corner ill send her over there dont worry about travelling but like i say we are where we are in our respect for clarissa to come over here shes a double medalist listen great fighters and this is why i say this fight is the best fight in womens fight of all time because we aint got light weights this is more or less the heavyweight division in womens boxing because weve got to punch a boxer against a superb boxer as well so like i say when you look at the records and you match him up youve got clarissa does not come close to losing a contest and the same with savannah so these are the only two in this division um theyre on a collision course now the fights been made and you know im excited for this fight i think its going to be a great fight you know full respect to clarissa shields im not going to sit here and dampen her credibility because nothing to dampen because im a realist shes a top top fighter and she gets maximum respect from me all the team youre very welcome over here because when all these glitz is out the way yeah all of this talk when the bell goes its one on one yeah and we just sit there and enjoy the ride because believe me this is going to be one hell of a fight its not going to be easy fight its a 50 50 fight but im excited savannahs super confident we cant wait to get this fight on the way wonderful words uh peter there um yeah and clarissas clapping thats absolutely fantastic it is just a magnificent fight and as you said about the the differences in styles as well it should just be an absolutely cracking clash a mix of everything thats great about boxing at elite level well youre at elite level and your thing is you know um what a thing for womens boxing this is you know its amazing you know its a real pleasure to be here and you know um you know like i cant speak highly enough of savannah you know were all very proud of what shes done and like i said and what shes about to achieve as well so its amazing to be here and i cant wait to see this fight just massive for womens boxing and peter just finally how much belief did you have when you first started working with savannah and how much belief now as we stand here today just weeks away from september the 10th that she can bring all those belts back to britain and fulfill her destiny as the undisputed middleweight champion of course she can bring him back you know she wouldnt be here if she couldnt bring him back you know were not here for a payday you know if i didnt believe savannah was capable of winning it wouldnt even be satya savannah wouldnt be sad to hear you know look shes highly capable she is one of if not the best fighter in the world that i await and was very much looking forward to this fight im not going to say shes winning shes losing shes doing anything but shes highly capable of winning this fight thats why i say its a 50 50 fight because it is its a its a fantastic matchup in all regards you know because you can look at styles pick one over the other theyve both had a look at each other you know closely both after seeing each other no doubt ultimately believe theyre going to beat each other but theres one thing that you can look what you want to look at outside the ring and the same goes for both of them but when youre in front of uh when the bell goes in front of each other its a different ball game so like i say i know what to expect and uh its my job to uh get savannah in the best physical shape put it through some immense pain barriers in this fight some complete grueling sparring is going to happen because listen this is i see it ending up in one way this fights going to end up in the trenches so thats why im excited about this fight brilliant peter it will end up in the trenches ben just listening to dimitri and to peter there its the respect for these fighters for this night is extraordinary and right i think what uh peter and dimitri said about being a boxing fan as a boxing fan you cannot ask for anything more in a fight its a 10year story its a uk versus the us its a clash of styles its fighters in their prime its two yin and yang really personalities its incredible you couldnt script it you couldnt write it and its come at a perfect time for womens boxing so to be able to finally make the fight on an allwomens card but particularly have these two at the forefront of our sport and i think who are going to take it to a complete another level i really think well look back on this in five 15 years time as this was the fight that really broke the mainstream its the first generation of fighters that have really broken through larissa all the struggles she had to go through to even become a boxer who won a world title after four fights in savannah who had to be persuaded to to get out of the gym and continue to go back and she just wouldnt take no for an answer they loved the sport that much and they are the ones that have broken through and now we see it as i say ten years later its incredible that this will now headline the o2 and and be a historic night for the whole sport experience leave the last word to these wonderful world champions who will aim to become undisputed on september the 10th clarissa lets have a final prediction of what is going to happen what do you see unfolding on what will be such a standout night for boxing september 10th youre going to see a very exciting fight especially early on you know with savannah marshall being a knockout punch or me being being a knockout puncher and a boxer but i see myself coming out on top i can knock savannah marshall out in rounds 8 9 or 10 and we look at savannah and give her a message a final message from you dont get injured dont waste no more time ill see you september 10th savannah what makes you win this fight and how do you do it on september the 10th ill win this fight through heart and my brain my boxing brain be boxing brim rinse me this fight and september the 10th i will become undisputed middleweight champion of the world and that will be the end of all this quote rubbish ill not be ram down anyones neck anymore thatll be the end of it and if youve got a final word for clarissa before september the 10th see you on september the 10th thank you very much its a wonderful fight and a wonderful night september the 10th at the 02 shields marshall maya garden and many more great women on

sesame seeds we dont have that all right you guys are lucky that sounds really nice we only have one size according to the website and the kfc i went to and that is this how accurate do these measurements need to be really oh its so good unfortunately here in india we do not have mashed potatoes but that would be pretty awesome we do have fries were big fans of them and they come in two sizes medium and large and in the us we also have two sizes of fries at kfc the individual for an individual and the large also for an individual nikhil let us now measure the large to see how much you get 140 grams laughing thats never not funny thats the third time thats happened and its always funny look at that block of fries our largest fry is more than double their largest fry heres our individual 150 our smallest is bigger than their largest in kfc india we can get our chicken in six portion sizes no 1 the single piece twopiece they like to give you one breast piece and one leg piece kind fourpiece leg piece to top it all off the leg piece on top as they say like cherry on top no ok now we move on to buckets we have four sizes the first one is a fivepiece bucket that comes with only leg pieces and also does not come in a bucket for some reason why kfc i want a bucket next up we have a sixpiece bucket an eightpiece bucket and the largest one of them all a 10piece leg bucket whew thats a lot of chicken in the us our kfc chicken comes in seven portion sizes one which you can get à la carte twopiece with a combo threepiece with a combo fourpiece with a combo then snaps buckets did that work ok we have an eightpiece yeah eight pieces the 12piece and our largest bucket the 16piece ready yuelei what you get the idea next up youre going to need a drink to wash all that chicken down here in india we dont serve cups we just serve cans we have pepsi 7up mirinda which is an orange soda red bull and a pepsi pet bottle however these will vary from store to store in some places they might not serve plastic and in some places you might not get these drinks you might get something else they also serve something called a virgin mojito krusher which they dont deliver unfortunately but heres an image of it refreshing american drinks come in these following sizes the regular which is 20 ounces and the large which is 30 ounces and we dont stop there if you want you can also get halfagallon bag of your favorite drink of choice look at this thing mm its convenient burps here is everything youll find on the menu at kfc india that you wont get in the us and heres everything you can find at a kfc in the us you wont find in india take a look india take a good look ok lets start with chicken in india apart from the crispy chicken we also get smoky red chicken ooh wow i believe this is kfcs answer to tandoori chicken if you guys dont know what a tandoor is its basically a cylindrical oven that they light up using wood fire or charcoal and it adds a really smoky flavor to the meats or breads that you cook inside of it i doubt kfcs across the country have an actual tandoor but the flavoring definitely smells like that the marinade looks like that oh my god thats actually pretty good you know what kfc pretty good job you have to remember kfc is competing with a lot of mughlai restaurants across every indian city and while this doesnt have as much of that smoky char that a lot of tandoori kebabs have it has a lot of flavor and the chicken is quite juicy good job its super spicy though so if youre somebody who cant handle spice go a little easy on this one when an indian says somethings spicy its spicy i believe you man i believe you that looks incredible we unfortunately dont really have anything too spicy on the menu for the chickenonthebone options really the only thing that we have here that apparently you guys dont have is something that is what i associate kentucky fried chicken with is extracrispy i dont know exactly what makes it extracrispy but it is as you can imagine crispier than the regular chicken crunching extracrispy to me is far superior to the regular way they cook chicken i think it should be the other way around this should be the regular and the other one should be like halfcrispy you know what i mean this is way better all right lets move on to chicken sandwiches here in india we dont have an american chicken sandwich but we have a zinger and a smaller sandwich called a krisper cute the krisper looks like it wants to grow up and be a zinger someday they also come in two variants a spicy krisper and a tandoori zinger lets taste all of them oh thats pretty yum theyve used a different kind of mayonnaise here it has a bit of sweetness to it and a spicy kick at the end and now for the legendary zinger back in the day there were only two fastfood chains here in india it was mcdonalds and kfc and while mcdonalds had more affordable burger options the kfc zinger was so delicious it was always a treat to eat mm and it still is i love that they use a whole boneless piece of proper chicken in there delicious mayo its so delicious ok now lets try the spicy variants this is the spicy krisper look at this sauce its almost bloodred im excited oh my god this sauce almost has a szechuan taste to it next up the zinger but tandoori mm i love the fullness of the chicken that comes in these burgers versus like a minced chicken patty in other restaurants theres so much bite to it its so juicy tender that all sounds amazing stop youre going too fast i have to say those sandwiches look delicious and i am jealous one sandwich you can get here in the us cant get in india is this little guy the chicken little looks to be a chicken tender in between these tiny little buns pickles goodbye could probably eat like five of those slightly different from what you have in india so im going to use it as an excuse to show it off yet again our crispy chicken sandwich this thing the original the bad boy also with pickles hang on get off of my sandwich but it has this really creamy mayo sauce on it the bun i love this yeah other chicken stuff we got here you aint got im already getting loopy start over here nashville hot tender chicken here this i think is the spiciest thing youre getting at the kfc menu and im gonna be straight up ive had these before these are pretty good and theyre really crispy yuelei want to hear that crisp again crunching not sure if its made it over to india yet it is called a chicken pot pie its a pie but instead of there being you know fruit or any of the sweet stuff you like they fill a pie with chicken and what do you think else is in here corn gravy peas maybe i have no idea im not going to rip this thing open this thing its got some weight to it this is a meal right here this is not a side i dont know where it is in the menu but whew this right here the kfc famous bowl and it is famous let me tell you nikhil if youre wondering what this is someone at kfc was like how can we put everything into one bowl and this thing was born it is mashed potatoes corn the popcorn chicken cheese and gravy all in a convenient bowl for you to eat while you are driving it generally does nothing for the flavor its exactly what i would think this would taste like its just a bunch of this stuff in one bowl yes in india you can get wings at the kfc but at our kfc in the us you can get your wings sauced and we have three different sauces honey barbecue buffalo nashville hot honey barbecue thumbs down this buffalos a lot more orange than i recall buffalo being i cannot quite place my finger on why suddenly my stomach is killing me do you see inside there ok yuelei laughs on to the next wing bring on that food poisoning baby um yeah all these are bad all right moving away from chicken indias kfc actually has vegetarian alternatives for all our burgers there is a vegetarian krisper a vegetarian spicy krisper and a vegetarian zinger now while india has a majority population of nonvegetarians around 70 there is a huge vegetarian population which is why a lot of fastfood restaurants have to make sure they have a lot of vegetarian options on their menu to make it more approachable and acceptable for all people over here theres also levels to vegetarianism over here there are iwilleateggbutnotchicken vegetarians there are iwilleatfishbutnotlamb vegetarians there are iwilleatthecurry butnotthepieces vegetarians there are iamvegetarianonlyontuesdays vegetarians there are ihavemadeapromisetogod forthisonemonth vegetarians there are iamvegetarian soyouwillallbevegetarian vegetarians theyre the weird ones and we try not to talk about them which is why kfc in india brands itself as just kfc theres no kentucky fried chicken anywhere here because obviously im not going to go to a place thats named that if im one of these many types of vegetarians one iconic dish that youll find on the kfc india menu is biryani and so kfc india has taken a very bold decision to launch their own biryanis if you dont know what biryani is you are living under a gigantic boulder my friend hey guess i live under a boulder because i unfortunately am not familiar with biryani but i would love to know more about it hello i am crystelle pereira and i am a cook and a baker and you may know me as a finalist from the great british bake off this bell dings is biryani now biryani is a typical rice dish you find in south asia and the way you make it is in layers my dad is a biryani master at home and the way he makes it is with cooked rice cooked potatoes some fried onions and a curry we like to go for a mutton biryani but you can get chicken or fish and in this case vegetarian biryani we absolutely love it and we always eat it as a family unit with a lovely pot of cooling raita on the side which is a lovely cooling yogurt dish which goes really well with the spicy biryani and its basically our equivalent of a sunday roast because you have it in a big pot and you all take scoops and i actually dont think ive ever eaten biryani by myself for one person now we have to talk about this kfc biryani because for me biryani is a home dish you make it in a home kitchen its cooked by a family member and its cooked with love my first impression a kfc biryani those two words just dont go together for me just to give you guys context of what its like to be indian and eat a biryani at kfc its like being italian and eating a pasta at dominos got it thank you continue they come in four flavors no 1 classic chicken nice and crispy no 2 popcorn chicken no 3 the spicy red chicken that i really enjoy and no 4 the veg patty which its so tempting to just push that to the side because veg biryani is already just a concept that were not a fan of over here but just for now you can stay here ok im going to begin with the popcorn chicken biryani which is just so blasphemous to begin with mm hm its not a biryani its  im so upset right now this one the spicy red chicken has a bit of that tandoori vibe to it theyve really tried to overcompensate with the spices theres a lot of clove flavor just to convince you youre eating a biryani so go easy on that curry i could eat this like if i was hungry not a biryani though that biryani looks real depressing i am sorry but we do have these exclusive side dishes which are mashed potatoes i cant believe you guys dont have mashed potatoes it feels like this is flagship stuff here macaroni and cheese biscuits again no biscuits coleslaw this giant dish of just gravy and of course sweet corn new country new sauces yall know what that means sauce talk first one i mean the kfc sauce why this isnt at every kfc internationally i have no idea get a load of that sauce right there i think its like ketchup and mayo but its really good honey barbecue i know what that tastes like honey mustard thats not your thing honey and of course you got classic ranch not much of a ranch aficionado but theirs is just ok and oh i forgot about their hot sauce yuelei india does not have too many exclusive dips in fact we just have a veg eggless mayonnaise and a tandoori masala mayonnaise its time to taste im using the same hand because here in india we dont eat with our left hand if youre wondering why commenters you let them know why dont indians eat with their left hand well its just mayonnaise so good job on that mayonnaise again with a little bit of a sweet but also spicy kick to it i wish we had more options especially considering there are so many different delicious chicken options id love to be able to dip my tenders in more sauces that is a weird sentence for those of you with a sweet tooth we have two exclusive dessert options chocolate chip cookie and this chocolate chip cake how good does this look here in india we have two exclusive desserts a choco mud pie and a coffee mousse cake ooh boy just look at this cross section my friend next up coffee mousse cake yeah these are pretty average as desserts drinks drinks drinks maybe my favorite part of the exclusives section exclusive drinks you can get in the us you cannot get in india mountain dew im back baby mm and if youre a mountain dew fan such as me you know kfc has got the exclusive mountain dew sweet lightning so mountain dew sweet lightning is like peach mountain dew and its really good its really good mm think this is a lemonade the usstyle lemonade not that weird uk sprite lemonade oh so good from there you can also get sierra mist sighs ugh ugh and of course sweet tea whoa thats like really sweet oh thats really good exclusive drinks in kfc india we have mirinda which is an orange soda and red bull lets talk about mirinda this is a drink that really evokes nostalgia 90s kids will know what im talking about when i say mirindaaaaa which country is getting the better deal on its kfc lets compare a few menu items to find out both countries offer eightpiece chicken bucket here in la one of these goes for 1999 if you order an eightpiece chicken bucket here at kfc india it will cost you 69905 rupees very specific which is currently 915 us dollars that makes the american eightpiece bucket 118 more expensive than the one in india does making your meal a combo help the us price out at all take this chickensandwich combo with fries and a drink it will set you back in america 999 the indian equivalent is a zinger meal where you can get a chicken sandwich some medium fries and a drink for 31905 rupees or 418 us dollars in fact the price difference is so great you can get something called the ultimate savings bucket for just 599 rupees or 788 and this contains four pieces of hot and crispy chicken six hot wings four boneless strips three drinks and three dips yeesh in fact you can throw in a choco mud pie as a dessert and still get all of this for much cheaper than the american combo meal but is it really that cheap here in india no because twothirds of india is still under the poverty line and for them this meal is still very aspirational they earn less than 2 a day sorry to be a downer but this is still a meal that is only available to the really privileged here in india unfortunately kfc does not share a full list of ingredients with the public its actually the same in the us all kfc shares with the public is a list of allergens so what do we know about kfc well the kfc india website has a couple of clues we know that all of our chicken is farmed here and not imported and all of it is 100 whole muscle chicken that means its made from whole pieces of chicken and not cuttogether minced chicken like you find in chicken nuggets in fact the website says they have an openkitchen policy and what that means is anybody can walk into a kfc and apparently ask for a kitchen tour and you can go into the kitchen look at everything and ask as many questions as you want i have never heard of that in my entire life an openkitchen policy ive worked in several kitchens and ill tell you straight up if i was in a kitchen working and some dude walks in and is like hey can i get a tour of the kitchen id be like yeah heres your tour theres the exit definitely cant do that in the united states dont go into a kfc chicken and demand a tour the kfc us website also gives us some hints about the ingredients it uses over here for instance all of our chicken is raised on us farms to the usda and fdas standards so that means there are no added hormones or steroids in american kfc chicken in addition to this as of 2019 yum brands the parent company of kfc stopped purchasing chicken raised using antibiotics indian chicken farmers were previously criticized for overusing antibiotics as recently as 2018 the bureau of investigative journalism found out that a lot of indian farmers were feeding colistin to their chickens as a growth promoter without any medical supervision colistin is known as the antibiotic of the last resort holy f oh my god thats so frightening and its only given to humans when other antibiotics have failed so if we give our chickens colistin then the humans who consume it might become resistant to it in fact they can develop a antibioticresistant superbug and thats not good yuelei this sounds like the plot to a horror movie what is he talking about that is terrifying im gonna assume we dont do that here and if we do oh god but when a report came out talking about the ill effects of colistin india ended up banning it completely so were safe from colistin at last we should also point out that the kfc india website is in major need of an update there is an faq page where people have asked things like how many calories does this chicken have or sometimes i see red deposits in my chicken what is it and for almost all of these questions the answers are just filler text so if you ask me what those red deposits are i genuinely dont know thats interesting lets take a look at this website right now ahem is kfc providing healthcare to their employees kfc responds standard dummy text ever since the 1500s when an unknown printer took a gallery of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book what is kfc doing for the safety of their staff lorem ipsum is a simple dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry yeah they gotta update their site thats pretty funny

35NJft4rqOc,end game tacko fall gameplay should you order this tacko for tacko tuesday in nba 2k22 myteam,Game,you it is get your its your boy inside back here with another video and in this video today guys were gonna be doing a gameplay of the new dark matter and game tackle fall in nba 2k 22 my team now im not gonna go over his stats and im definitely not gonna go over as badges because theres nothing to go over guys hes got every stat in the game on 99 hes got all 80 hall of famers what i am going to be going over is how many end game tacos are there being pulled because i think that is important to kind of give him a price estimate ive said it before and ill say it again i do believe taco fall is the best card in the game and theres honestly quite a few tacos up so i mean thats not to say hes gonna be cheap or anything like that but there are quite a few tacos up tacos got the best player model player built in my team seven six one more can you ask for an end game taco fall card shots if i got hendrix for letting me up on his account to make this game but first one and if you are new to the channel man make sure to smash that subscribe button as were on the road towards 100 000 subscribers now looking at taco fall here in chiron the first thing i want to say is we know tacos got better dribble six and that is a good thing for taco i i gotta say it is a good thing in general uh the fact that he does have you know better dribble six see i think what is it is that the tray size up or the steph curry size up escape i dont know i get those two mixed up but i mean he moves pretty well for his size most players that are his height dont move that well i feel like tackle moves pretty well for being 76 though and maybe im wrong but thats just my brief opinion as far as his release being said shot 25 what more do you want out of it thats thats the big question i have what more could you possibly want out of his release i mean its gonna be straight up and down its gonna be really quick really easy to time and green its an incredible release so i say it i feel like tacos got a lot going for him with yeah we saw yaos free throw line dunks i wonder if taco has got free throw line dunks as well because yao took off from literally like 17 feet away so im wondering if taco can do the same i mean thats not right he basically jumped for from the free throw line there for the quick drop dunks yeah i dont know i dont know if tackle has free throw line dunks or not i guess said something well have to see and and focus on later on but from what im seeing briefly here in chidra and theres a lot to like about doc in my opinion guys today should just be referred to as tacos day i mean its tuesday and weve got a good taco card in my team i mean he got a d rose size up says shot 25 great movement in the full court and half court i mean what more can you want now i want to see does he shoot corner threes because ive seen a lot of it a lot of people have been talking about how i mean players havent started with said shot 25 not being able to shoot corner threes and you guys can see right there with taco thats a long two and so that is something about said shot 25 that is a little bit annoying i think its just for a current gen that players do step in and i know in my last gameplay i said they dont and its looking like they do step in which again is just that little bit annoying but my thing for a taco is hes seven six you cant ask for him to move any better than he does is he gonna be that primary ball handler no but hes not a hes not horrible at handling the ball and i do think that is important as far as im concerned man this taco cards looking like hes it in my team its tuesday its taco tuesday and im headed right into a game of my team unlimited now i gotta say my opponents got them guys hes got taco i dont know if its in game attack or not but the rest of his squad is all end game players so honestly wouldnt totally be stunned if he did have a bunch of just end game talent right here and thats my fault come here oh my gosh giannis yup yo yiannis back to him oh my gosh taco oh my gosh taco chill i know i know he gonna be able to defend thats fine defend all you want you leave giannis on to the koopa wide open from the threepoint line that is outstanding exquisite offense oh my gosh oh my gosh and one i gotta finish that one do yall see look at taco move man thats good and again hes not gonna be your primary boyner but if he can slide the opponents taco or yell like that i like that and trust me i like that yep what are we doing no way right run oh my gosh taco that should be green its my fault i apologize for not grading even against endgame kobe you gotta get close enough so you can mash them yeah yeah do not try that at home hes trying to test taco in lanes are you crazy hes got the best player model weve ever seen yup and you dont get those feats yet you dont get those feet set uh oh uh oh i go for a fan it out converting on that one right there im loving it were good you have good switch taco garden boy yup run what fade we got oh my gosh what day we got taco its tuesday and it is tacos day right now oh my goodness gracious the fact that 2k let that happen it is annoying to me i mean it really is back to him what fade he got oh i gotta know what fade taco god im gonna try some things out here you got the trey fade but we got taco come here oh my gosh it dont matter what fadys got when hes hessing right past the yao ming oh im fading right here hopefully oh back up okay my opponent back up so i can have some fun with mr taco uh oh nah this is crazy why did he pop to 40 feet i dont know if he would have green that he would have been the undisputed best though go past scotty see scotty barn shoots corner three so its just weird i dont know its its interesting maybe if theyre below a certain height they do shoot corner threes i dont know its very intriguing what you went up oh my gosh you went up with that on mr taco are you crazy are you cr early bro its why oh my gosh its wide open whats the reasoning for shooting it early my boys he missed yo why is he trying to time layups oh my gosh how is that a no contest i dont know but im not gonna ask questions and after that first quarter i dont blame my opponent but he had had enough heres the deal with taco fall and i and i know a lot of people are gonna say ty why would you get the end game taco well the only reason you get the end game tackle fall is if you want the best team of the game this taco fall that is flash glitch is the best taco fall for his specific price whether its the invincible or the flash these are the two i probably recommend for their price the most why because the end game tackle fall is going to be over a million mt now is he the best card in the game probably i do think this card is the best card in the game but 90 of you guys arent going to be able to buy him and so you know the flash glitch or the invincible both those cards are basically his level just without set shot 25 so for me on my xbox account im definitely getting the end game taco no matter what i have to pay i will pay the price for this tackle fall card the best center the best card in the entire game honestly guys if you want to run him and him and yeah together you definitely can run you out with the four attack with the five if you want to get cheesy for me theyre probably gonna be both my centers taco at the starting center with yao at the backup center position i dont know your thoughts on taco

G8gb9q7lOEg,stop dont buy an apple watch right now new leaks,Tech,the apple watch series 8 lineup is coming very soon likely within the next two months and i think that is going to be a game changer and awesome upgrade with a brand new design especially if we get the new series 8 pro model which i think is what the rugged rumors are leading to and im gonna explain why i think that in this video alongside all my other leaks and rumors that im gonna discuss in this video including the display size but before i get into those new series 8 lineup leaks i want to discuss the current apple watch lineup so lets get started now currently we have the brand new series 7 which has the larger display compared to the old series 6 with the new more rounded edges and corners and thats definitely a really nice display but it does start at 400 just like it did before we have the apple watts se which has the same kind of design and chip as the old series five except that it does not have the always on display thats exclusive to the highend series seven model and then we have the series three which i think should not even exist at this point it has the old chip the old design look at that the square display it does not look good its outdated its only two hundred dollars but i do not think thats a good buy because you pay a little bit more you get the se thats a much better buy and the crazy thing is that apples new watch os software its going to be coming out this fall and apparently its not even going to support the series 3 which basically means that apple is going to be discontinuing this series 3 model and theyre going to be introducing a new model into the lineup which mark german is saying is the rugged edition but before i get into explaining those leaks and rumors lets start off with some of the other ones now first of all over the past six months i made a couple of videos talking about the series a pro including this one talking about the truth revealed and this basically talked about how john prosser thought that the series seven was going to be getting the new flat sides with the whole redesign potentially a flat display but in this video he mentioned that maybe he had his leaks a little bit early so maybe all those flat design rumors are actually going to be coming true with the series 8 model which i believe is to be the case but with that said lets jump into these rumors back on july 3rd we had some rumors where the apple watch series 8 might be able to tell if you have a fever so there was a chance that they could use these new health tracking sensors potentially the temperature tracking sensor to see if you have a fever and basically give you a warning let you know to get some water get some rest which would be a really really cool feature and then just the other day mark german came out with an awesome report saying that apples gonna have a rugged extreme sports watch coming later this year with a larger nearly two inch screen yes thats pretty large and ill explain what they mean by that nonaluminum metal case its going to be more shatter resistant in terms of the screen and im going to explain why that makes sense a larger battery of course because its going to have a larger display body temperature sensor improvements to hiking and swim tracking and more and getting into the actual display details we had a report from ross young and jeff poo saying that the new display is going to be around 5 larger now specifically its 199 inches which sounds massive but apparently the way that theyre measuring it is diagonal so thats how the panel suppliers measure it so its not actually going to be the size of the display itself which some people thought it could be up to 50 millimeters but that is not true apparently according to the way that apple measures and markets their display sizes joe resignal thinks it might be around 46 or 47 millimeters in size and shrimp apple pro actually thinks it could be 47 millimeters for just the display alone so that would mean that you would have sizes of 43 millimeters and 47 millimeters for the small size and the large size and i personally think it actually makes sense to have a 46 millimeter i dont know if thats possible with this big 199 inch display size maybe its gonna be larger but i think itll flow smoothly because im personally expecting the apple watch se2 to have the same display size thats 40 millimeter and 44 for 279 dollars than the regular series 8 model which is 41 and 45 which is matching the series 7 right now and the price is going to stay the same 399 for the aluminum model of course more if you get the different finishes and i think for the series 8 pro or the new rugged edition model 42 and 46 so its kind of like incrementally stepping up higher and higher i think thatll make sense but for eight hundred dollars with a titanium chassis as the standard option or of course some kind of other alloy or metal because shrimp apple pro is actually saying that the new metal is gonna be different from aluminum and it could be some kind of liquid metal with an alloy mixture im not sure what exactly that means but i think titanium would be a good choice because it is more rugged while also being lightweight but now i want to explain why this is going to be a big deal and this new apple watch series 8 pro model is going to be very enticing first of all i think that john prosser and ians elbow were correct about their rumored new design with the flat sides and i think it could end up looking something like this maybe its not going to be that large of a flat side but generally something like this and this is important because as you can see the display is completely flat now mark german was saying that its going to be a lot more rugged and the screen will be more shatter resistant well if you look at these renders the actual display can be completely flat now when you do this it allows you to make the bezels thinner a lot more easier like for example with the iphone 12 just by going to the flat design apple was able to make the bezels a lot thinner than they were with the iphone 11 because that rounded glass and everything made it difficult to put in a larger display underneath it so having a completely flat panel will make it easier to enlarge the display and thin down those bezels even more which will allow the actual chassis to not get that massive when youre increasing the actual display size but not only that the actual metal lip is going to be protruding out of the apple watch with the display kind of tucked in which is gonna make it a lot more durable because if you accidentally smack something youre smacking the outside metal shell and frame instead of smacking the glass like you have on the current apple watch designs making it a lot more easy to shatter so that would solve that issue and now about six months ago when i made this video about the series 8 pro leaks i made a few predictions first of all i had the 800 starting price coming with a titanium chassis standard i have the prediction of much better battery life because if youre switching from rounded glass and display underneath it to a flat design you could actually move the whole display panel with glass higher making more internal space for everything else including a larger battery so much better battery life of course since youre also making the chassis a little bit larger as well and max safe support new highend sensors which we could get with the temperature sensor and of course the larger display which i thought would be 46 millimeters but i want to talk about the max 8 because mark german has been talking about the future ipad pro coming with wireless mac save support and he even mentioned that we could be seeing apple watch max safe charging support coming in the future and i think if we do get a larger series 8 pro with a flat design i think it will support max save charging and thatll be a huge feature for a lot of people because i feel like apple is going full force into wireless max aid because theyve added it to the airpods theyre going to be adding it to the ipad pro as far as the rumors are concerned and we even got some patents of apple working on adding wireless mac save chargers built into the center console of the apple car in the future so i think apple is going full force into mac safe and i believe its going to be coming to the apple watch as well specifically for this larger model so with that said because of these leaks even if you dont go for the series 8 pro model or just the regular series 8 i think its a good idea to hold off for another two months before buying one of the current apple watches because i believe the series se model is going to be replaced with the se2 i believe the series three is going to get completely discontinued do not buy that one and of course the series 8 is going to get some incremental updates compared to the regular series 7 model so if you disagree with me on anything in this video let me know in the comment section below but if you agree click the circle but to subscribe and definitely check out those two older videos i made right there thanks for watching and well see you in the next video music you

5279n4i15ho,rare pakistani village food the mountain people of hunza,Food,in this video youre going to see the hidden food and lifestyle of pakistans most isolated mountain people meet the hunza this is a combination i would never expect to see together in one dish music but first lets back up pakistan has a population of 220 million youll find similar culture dress food and people in most cities across the country that is until you get here in the far north of pakistan beyond a multitude of mountain ranges youll find the hunza valley right now were in one of the many hunza villages on the mountainside mountain life here is so completely different from any other place in pakistan and i love it because mountain cultures tend to maintain their culture better over time a place so isolated its customs around food clothing and daytoday life still remain largely unaffected by the outside world right now im on my way to a local home to check out their kitchen and seawatch for breakfast music so we are continuing along right now going through this narrow path and up to a local home you have to come up these steps here the steps are made out of stone built into the house and you have to be careful because there is no railing here there are two ways to enter on the bottom floor and here on the top floor right through this miniature short door meant for joe pesci you walk in you see the main gathering room and then after that the kitchen lets go music were in the house of sadia generations of her family have lived here going 400 years back right now sadia and her mother are making breakfast good morning how are you doing yeah how are you im also just yeah shes making a couple different items for breakfast right now this is gonna be a pancake and then here is a fire shes flipped the pan upside down here so this has become the hot surface for the pancakes to cook on what is your favorite thing to cook is it gabratani new down india no its not that really i just thought maybe because this entire room is completely wallpapered with food packages of indian rice you know how long you cook sometimes you throw away the box and you have to dig it back out because youre like wait how am i supposed to cook this again they never have that problem here guillen is a type of local pancake made from wheat flour eggs water and apricot oil right now shes taking a piece of dough and shes used the dough to spread butter on the pan here its got a big scoop oh yes this pan is roaring hot even my knee is about to catch on fire at this point the people like hot because theyre very cold at altitudes of at least 8 000 feet the air is thin and the climate can be harsh about time to give it a flip i love the texture the pattern on here it looks like the top down view of this village when you look at this houses built into the mountainside hug up against each other so no space is wasted the thick stone outer walls stabilize temperatures inside when its hot or when its cold where is the smoke going there oh theres a hole there in hunza homes the kitchen is located in the heart of the house radiating heat and dispensing food in this house each floor has a kitchen on the second floor right now theres a skylight above us so thats letting in all this natural light and then theres this glass box right here which lets in even more light for the floor below what is this room normally used for its for summer time sitting here and so you eat here yeah do you sleep here yeah how many people sleep in this room then be honest out of 10 people how many snore uh three three we have a lot of different food here some dishes i havent seen anything like this this trip so far we have the pancakes i saw you make that and then what is this one dry apricot soup rehydrate the dried apricots in hot water add crumbs of dough and wheat flour and cook until the mixture becomes thick it looks so much more complex maybe because theres just so many different colors of apricot theres like dark ones and light ones and its created this beautiful like orangey brown heel to the broth which is also quite thick lets try it out its very sweet obviously apricot flavor it feels more like a dessert than anything else this is addictive 90 of the food that you will have here one common ingredient is going to be apricot so again the soup has dried apricots this soup has apricot seeds music this is a type of noodle soup dish smash the apricot kernels or seeds then add them to a pot of hot water to create a broth season with a little bit of salt i saw these earlier i thought they were almonds so they look like almonds but basically apricot seeds these are so good theyre like a much better almond theyre not like all dry and chalky theyre half the size the noodles are made fresh from scratch wheat flour salt eggs and water mixed together to make the dough knead it then cut into small short strands and cook music it is such gentle flavors tastes homemade you can taste like the wheat from the wheat noodle this soup is like my kind of soup i like my soup to be a bit lighter joining our meal ali a pakistani man on a mission to introduce his countrys cuisine to the world though he hails from islamabad he hopes to one day retire in this region one other interesting thing about the food here is they didnt add any spices no sugar because how they like the food that every ingredient has its own flavor right here this is the pancake here she has apricot oil she just doused these with oil with this oil you can dump it as much as you want and you shouldnt feel guilty because its a very healthy oil lets try it out if you like sweet do you eat honey okay its not sweet now it tastes almost more like a crepe than a pancake which might have eggs in it the apricot oil i cant say it has a lot of flavor its food loop it kind of makes it easier to slide down your throat its very impressive very interesting to see in this side of pakistan because people if they know anything at all about pakistan is probably more about the big cities and the hustle and the bustle and the parts that have some similarities to india here completely different culture and different foods its obviously reflected here in what were eating right now less seasonings super local ingredients nothing too intense i love it very nice the hunza people or the hunzakuz are ethnically known as the barucho people with a population of sixty thousand they have their own distinct language musical instruments clothing and customs residing in the highlands of the himalayas theyre known for their longevity with an unofficial life expectancy of 100 years are your grandparents around yeah how old are your grandparents 100 and theyre alive yeah thats pretty good this is kind of what today is about one seeing a different lifestyle a different way of eating and living here in pakistan but also trying to understand what is so different here that allows people to live these long healthy lives im very impressed by that i must learn mem good day how are you im fine how are you im so excited to be here meet ms mazzati in her cozy mountainside kitchen for 17 years shes been whipping up regional favorites for locals and visitors alike what are you doing right now im making toilet this is the most vegetables ive seen so far on my trip so you already made this for us its a top cheeto it looks kind of like a chapati its a local pizza wheat dough is kneaded into a round shape and the filling made of chicken and local spices what is inside coriander mint onion green chili local japan garlic ginger little sauce cooking walnut and pecan oil you just gave away your whole recipe are you worried about that cover it with another layer of dough then cook it in a hot pan with apricot oil when both sides turn golden brown cut and serve with goat cheese music oh its so good it tastes like a whole wheat wrapper on the outside and then inside its just so flavorful its spicy you can taste the cumin theres a ton of caramelized onions coming through so what i like about this is that after having a breakfast which probably didnt have much taste to it this is like a nice contrast yeah absolutely im gonna give it a little bit of a dip here a beautiful pairing clean cool refreshing and sweet to go with something a little bit more heavy and a lot more spicy this is delicious thank you how did you learn to cook is my own grandmother okay how old is your grandmother 99 years she is there yeah oh she passed away yeah oh she was 99 thats remarkable my grand father is a 104 year old right now he passed away yeah but 104 and one secret that is the organic food but plenty of people in the usa eat organic food its not working out for them having organic food just for like a few years just to satisfy your own self is something else but being raised in this very environment and you keep on having that for your entire life is different are you saying its too late for me yeah a bit too late okay its never too late the diet here may be a key factor in hunter longevity organic raw vegetables fruits and moderate protein consumption mineral rich mountain water is plentiful and then theres this the priced apricot rich in vitamin a and other antioxidants this food is omnipresent in hunza cooking used for its fruit seed and oil sometimes a lot of oil like in our next dish this is add water to a pot then add dry cow cheese dried mint salt coriander onion green chilies and small crumbs of chapati cook cows with apricot oil and its ready bro bro this looks stunning this is food for the soul and also stomach we have a couple other ones here i think well build up to this first we have this i dont know what youd call the super stew this one is called gilgit meaning brown lentil and potato a type of stew thats eaten with chapati made by stir frying coriander paste mint and green chilies in a pot add masala water brown lentils salt and potatoes cook and serve im gonna put some lentils some potato on here kind of a natural gravy thats come from all that lets try it out music thats super yummy its lentils potatoes but it has a nice texture and great flavor man this feels like real homecooked food none of these like super intense street food flavors and what i really love about it is its so spicy in the right way yeah its like warming me up from the inside this one is called in the middle theres a pool of oil which uh is bringing me back to the lahore vibe there is a reservoir right here of just butter sorry butter i want to see if i can taste the oil directly to see if it has any flavor oh yeah when you eat it just alone it has a little flowery essence to it do we mix all that together take a spoonful of molita dip the spoon in this and then lets go for it oh oh this is the most confusing thing ive ever eaten but i genuinely like it i dont know where the flavors are coming from i dont know how theyre combining its like dairy but then its also spice its like putting tabasco in your yogurt in the morning theres a lot going on in my mouth right now thats what i was trying to say that had four taste phases so theres like a powdered cheese in there dehydrated couches that has its own unique flavor at first its like creamy and cheesy like veneer and then it gets a little bit gamey after that theres some floweriness coming from this oil it does have some spice but its not all like cumin and coriander it has its own flavor profile super unique sure morita takes the crown this is no joke its one of the most beautiful places ive ever seen in my life i cant believe it every time i look out there im like thats cg thats not real music why do you think this part of the world is so unknown to so many definitely in pakistan we had our realities couple of years ago because of all the law and order situation going on so the kind of media world that the world was getting was not very positive but things have become absolutely normal and now tourism is getting back to pakistan but other than that to be honest this part of pakistan they are super peaceful in fact for your audience i mean theyre lucky to see all of this but theyre unlucky in a way that the camera cannot capture the reality what the eyes can see so for that they have to come and see it for themselves i believe the nature has its own filter when you come to this part of pakistan its so beautiful like i mean well ali this has been very romantic my wife she would really enjoy this but at least im here with you thats nice stuck with me yeah restaurants like this slightly alter their traditional recipes to suit visitors from other parts of pakistan who prefer stronger more spicy flavors im realizing now the only way to truly experience what it means to eat like a hunza coot is to go to someones home youve come to another home in the same village the home has very similar architecture even if you look up there that is the skylight this time we are in the basement were gonna make a chapati its a cheese chapati yeah ah i like cheese she starts with the bottom layer rolling it out she puts it on there i love the way the traditional kitchens work here this is basically a fire inside of here and then they can adjust the tops that they put on so this one is for making chapati but they have other ones where they can put big pots on there whatever you need they even have one that can uh make french fries thats not true so right now shes put down the first layer and shes gonna add in some of the filling this paste is made from cottage cheese coriander green onion walnut salt and a little bit of milk chapati number two it goes on and now we have a little walnut oil a generous portion of walnut oil this is nasib and her sister whats your name nice to meet you my name is sunny in my language sunny means legendary eater you know ive eaten uh seven things today okay how many things did you eat tea and bread i like this bread this is a corn wheat this is essentially cornbread right here oh you ate already music oh i took too big of a piece its very then you eat this bread then not speaking because it makes your mouth so dry finish this bread then talk thats a really good idea its just like any good cornbread it absorbs all the saliva in your mouth please wait ten minutes music done can i tell you something today i ate eight foods because i had that music we have our dinner here this looks incredible so theyve cooked something that we saw already but it looks slightly different this is the ulida right also with the oil in there but so many other dishes here weve got a chicken noodle soup buckwheat pancakes cheese chapati some dumplings and then a dessert can we start with these dumplings the filling is made of minced chicken coriander green onions and green chilies that is wrapped in a wheat flour dough and steamed these may look like east asian dumplings but here theyre called mine too in korea this exact same thing is called mandu theres no way thats a coincidence that the same food has a similar sounding name because the area that we are right now is almost bordering china and central asia so thats why you find dumplings here but not in lahore so different thats fascinating it has a really interesting combination of meat its like half meat half vegetable it tastes a little bit dry not super juicy but spicy a little bit more mild gentle flavors here they have cheese chapati lets try it out oh its good this ones cheesy it tastes almost like cream cheese with some chives inside whats your favorite food here this one this is a soup sauteed chopped onions ground ginger and garlic in olive oil add in minced chicken ginger more spices and boil when the noodles join the pot youre minutes away from completion thats delicious super savory really soft noodles almost like a fun noodle chicken is really tender and trust me i love a soup with no bones i hate when they give you soup and you have to do some other work like pull bones out of your mouth put them on the table this is very good this is the buckwheat pancake quite different than the ones that we had in the breakfast is this something you eat a lot jump is the other thing so shes saying that this is one contributing factor to the longevity of the local rules of people it tastes healthy buckwheat is highly recommended for various health problems can it help gas no oh god finally this is a dessert it has a pool a reservoir right in the middle full of oil this is walnut there are crushed walnuts all around it but then this brown mess what is that this brown component is basically made from organic local wheat flour so what they do is that they age the local wheat for five six days in water and somehow it becomes sweet so a lot of work goes into this for sure so now shes working her way around the perimeter so you can see its really thick she gets plenty of that oil on there lets try it out music the source of the hunza fountain of youth is debated by many this is one of the best desserts ive ever had its so fun to chew through and then really dense sweet texture is it the diet here is it the mountain water fresh air high elevation the copious amounts of apricot consumption perhaps its a low stress living or the fact that traditionally local folks would walk the mountains and work the fields for most hours of the day youve been here your whole life has this place changed much since you were a kid biggest defining change for her in this entire region is tourism because back then there used to be very few tourists but now like tourists are coming in big numbers so that has changed the oral landscape of the area and now kids are more focused towards studies rather than working in the fields which her generation used to do back then so now yeah the people are adjusting to the new trends in a good way because when you walk around these villages these alleyways you know you feel these people are loyal to their customs and their traditions fascinating thank you so much for inviting us in your home for the food and for the company i really appreciate it next time in the hunza mountains ill be taking on the ultimate animal cook up as i witness this village prepare an entire year just seeing it up close for the first time in my life right now its incredible and it inspires a little bit of fear music best ever food review show is a small team of independent creators and everything we do here works because of you guys click the link in our description to join our patreon and receive exclusive benefits of peace all right this is called you know were in a multigenerational home right now you cant be a young person cooking food without an older person telling you what youre doing wrong and thats what shes here for he said too hot oh do you want me to turn on the air con generally we never mix lentils with vegetables like this is a rare combination which is i believe very local so a potato is a vegetable definitely not a fruit is rice a vegetable yeah for sure do we mix all that together or what do you think the move is i think we need to figure out the move together should we ask him dont trust my movie like a local local im the only local done oh you need tea oh no shes dying oh im okay my saliva glands are like fire hydrants boom that was a whole video here in the unzones ali has been an incredible ambassador to pakistan allowed his incredible access to do and see so many things we wouldnt be able to do without him and for that i say thank you guys that is it for this one thank you so much for watching i will see you next time yeah i think we should jump in this lake its too cold oh okay good point lets find a hot tub hypothermia

itll be a two run double for t oscar hernandez i think he hit two his first big league game yeah and a back door breaking ball gets him for barrioss second strikeout of the ball game finishes gregorius off with a fastball up three consecutive strikeouts now for barrios lets see if a double can get the run home bouncer left side and thats going to be flagged down by chapman but a run will

springer we have seen him time after time in center field go to his right or go to his left looks to the light of jose barrios and vladimir guerrero what a play thats a guy who knows something about great catches out in center seven time gold glove award winner devon white saying man i used to be able to do that and he got him swinging him is it a changeup strikeout number ten for barrios castellanos uh zoe for two ground ball back toward the middle thatll go into left center field to base hit stubs he will cruise home from second base its an rbi single for castillanos thats the first hit for the top four or five hitters in this lineup tonight but having no success at all barrio strikes him out for the third time tonight 11 now for jose but again the phillies have tied it it is 33 going to the bottom of the fifth 11 punchouts with one out here in the sixth inning and a swing and a miss as he gets stopped a dozen strikeouts for burrillos that much emotion on the mound from barrios and he just tied his career high with strikeout number 13 on the night pick up those tough tough rbis when you have to fly ball left center giving it a ride good contact from goriel for his third hit of the night and on a bounce up over the fence the blue jays have the lead again barrios to meza to garcia and now to romano in the nine again the o2 left center field zimmer tracking it and he makes the catch and the blue jays will win it you

HESYWyrMXTg,i deep fried steaks in bone marrow and this happened,Food,thanks hellofresh for sponsoring this video this is one of the most exquisite ingredients in the world now usually you will never be able to find this amount because to extract this is a lot of work as everything starts off with this a ridiculous amount of bone marrow and today were gonna deep fry coffee a whole steak with it now the first thing we need to do is to extract all of the bone marrow as you can see they are completely frozen start getting a boat and adding a bunch of salt into the salty brine until everything not only defrosts but also release a little bit of that blood after about eight hours this is what it looks like so i got a paper towel and dried them up as much as possible and in the end i was left with a ridiculous amount of bone marrow as we take a closer look you can see that a little bit of the blood still remains so the next thing to do is to move them to a baking tray we want to extract all of that bone marrow out so into the oven he went in the broiler setting so everything can melt down at about 15 to 20 minutes i took them out and look you see a little bit of the blackness left in the bones thats actually some blood and connective tissue that was left behind so once that was done i removed all of the bones and using a strainer i took out all of the solids as in the end i was left with this 100 bone marrow aka the butter of the gods now this is not enough to cook a whole steak so i went ahead and repeated the process three times and in the end i was left with a ridiculous amount of bone marrow but hey once that was done the only thing left to do is to let it solidify in the refrigerator and after about one hour take a look yes the butter of the gods also known as one of the best things you can put on steaks talking about that these are the ones were gonna be using for todays cook there are three beautiful prime grade ribeyes now heres how this experiment is gonna go down first im gonna be saving this steak right here as were gonna be using with bone marrow the other two on the other hand im just gonna season them right now for that i added a good amount of salt followed by freshly ground black pepper and garlic powder for a good steak thats all you need well save this two in the refrigerator for right now as we need to go ahead and bring the bone marrow back to life for that i put it on my heating plate so everything can melt down i was looking for the butter of the gods to be at 135 degrees fahrenheit once the temperature was reached i added my steak i want to leave it in here and let it comfy until it reaches an internal temperature of 135 flipping it every 10 minutes is a good idea as once the internal temperature was reached i quickly removed it now this is a confident steak cooked in bone marrow and as you know even though its fully cooked we need to season it and put a crust on it so first i went ahead and added a good amount of salt followed by freshly ground black pepper and garlic powder once that was done it was now ready for the grill but remember the other two steaks the one on the left is going to be a control steak but one in the middle im going to be using what i like to call the googas butter of the gods but heres a quick recap on how to make it the first thing to do is to cure some egg yolks for that you use 50 salt and 50 sugar add in your egg yolks cover them all up with a salt and sugar and let them cure for five days once the time is up you wash them up with some water you are left with the perfect cured egg yolks to dry them even more you can go ahead and add them to your oven and in the end you are left with this the perfect cured egg yolk now my butter of the gods also uses bone marrow but instead of letting it become completely liquid i kept some of the solids i mean take a look i know what youre thinking its not that appetizing but you have to give this a try now to finish it up into the food processor i threw in room temperature butter followed by that bone marrow a little bit of parsley freeze dry shallots a little bit of garlic paste followed by some anchovy paste and one entire cured egg yolk now cover it up blend everything on high throw it down in some clinch plastic roll everything up let it solidify in your refrigerator and after about one hour this is what youre left with my take on the butter of the gods were gonna be using this on our second steak to see if its better or worse than the deep fried one in bone marrow now as you know we like to eat a full meal and this is todays side dish its just the perfect thing to go along with some steaks and to make it its super easy and heres how i first started by chopping up some potatoes the key thing here is to keep them the same exact size now into a large bowl they go followed by a good amount of olive oil right on top mix them all up to ensure that all of them are fully covered then i season them with salt followed by freshly ground black pepper and garlic powder mix that once again and thats it now add them to a baking tray make sure none of them are touching each other and into the oven they go at 400 degrees fahrenheit for 20 minutes and these are some very special homemade custom sausages i made to be specific they are cubano sausages i mean take a closer look at this thing because after about 20 minutes take a look at my potatoes perfectly golden brown exactly the way i want it so into a steak plate they went followed by those beautiful cubano sausages a little bit of chives right on top followed by cotija cheese then for some acidity i added some pickled onions and that is all there is to it this is todays side dish and ill tell you one thing its going to be the perfect side to go along with those steaks talking about that the only thing left to do is to go ahead and cook them and since these steaks are really really thin the only thing i really have to do is to put a nice beautiful crust on them so now i say it is enough talking and it is time to grill them so lets do it music music music does that look good or what and before we try it i want to thank todays sponsor

and the side dish has meat my god google you continue to outdo yourself this thing looks awesome meat with more meat and a little bit of potato i wonder what happened there this one here is actually something youve been asking me for such a long time leo and uh its the butter of the gods butter of the gods you guys talk about it so much im really really looking forward to trying this very good as you can see we have three steaks obviously its an experiment i just want your honest opinion were gonna go this direction today all right in let me know you ready for it oh my god oh yes lord have mercy you ready oh im so ready right now all right enough lets give it a try cheers everybody cheers thats tasty my god control that is the control troll is always good salt pepper garlic powder charcoal fire thats all you need everybody the tenderness of this steak is next level man this has to be some kind of higher cut theres no way that this is choice its prime wow really juicy very beefy i love the char on the outside its a classic google steak right here perfect steak i absolutely agree lets try this now are you ready i want to know your opinion dig in dig in all right go for it oh no what happened it rubbed on the top of the other steak oh no oh no you rubbed a little bit actually oh no oh i just dropped all right lets give this a go and let you know cheers everybody cheers they dont call it the butter the gas for nothing that has to be the creamiest steak ive ever tried that is insane how good that tastes i gotta say everybody i dont think ive ever made anything that is better than the butter of the gods because it is not only creamy it has egg yolks there besides bone marrow as well okay so thats where that savorine is that umami is coming from its difficult to describe if youve never had it its just perfect exactly very good now im excited for the last one lets go for it lets give it a try oh wait wait wait angels level oh thats right im so excited about this you know you know the great thing about this side dish theres a little bit of some some for everybody oh man i can tell yeah grab whatever you want so yeah i would just okay there you go wow we got pickled onions we got a little bit of potatoes in there we got some smoked sausage that i made previously lets give it a try to the side dish cheers everybody cheers oh man that reminds me of brazil when youre in the bar drinking a little bit of beer and then you just thats what thats for everybody what is that that had to have been the most perfect bite of a side dish like so much texture flavor my god that was an incredible incredible experience this is an awesome dish delicious highly recommend but enough with the side dish lets give this a go yeah yes im excited okay dig in and dont let it dip into the butter of the gods because this time you know its a whole different stage thats right for a second there i really wanted to go oh no but im going to try and keep it separate lets give it a try because im excited cheers everybody cheers oh my god im shook right now its different than this one and this one here i dont think the difference is like but its a nice slightly mature difference i actually think i might prefer this steak really over the butter of the glass i almost think that the crust is a little bit more pronounced on this one and also i think that richness is a little bit more amplified i can kind of taste it a little bit more than the previous one its not as creamy but its still really rich really good i disagree with the deal i 100 disagree as well this one has a flavor that pops out thats different but this one has more flavors im going to give you one more cheese okay i was gonna say as soon as i was thinking about the description and i was like wait theres no cream in it so i was like but i missed that creaminess i take it back i take it back yeah the butter of the god is still better im just joking you like what you like guys i suffer from a shortterm memory loss thats why i forgot what the butter of the guts tasted like it shows it shows so heres the deal this one right here i actually deep fried the whole steak in bone marrow right in bulma yeah you gotta watch the video um the bone marrow deep fried confit whatever you want to call it is delicious a lot of work im not quite sure if its worth it because making the butter of the god is better however leo liked this one better im really bad at remembering thats my issue right now let me know in the comments down below if you would make this bone marrow deep fried steak if its worth it for you if you even think about oh this is totally a waste i would love to know in the comments down below i hope you guys enjoyed this video if you did enjoy make sure you give it a thumbs

5NNO5Kb-PZo,dope tech the ipad pro killer,Tech,all right all right the results are in i have it here on this device so the award for most extra tech feature goes to the xiaomi smart wireless charging pad music whats up mkbhd here welcome back to dope tech brought to you of course by the dope tech tshirt this ones a healthy mix of great stuff and weird stuff mostly thanks to this guy so xiaomi released alongside their new me 10 ultra theyre really impressive phone thats also a mirror they also released this smart wireless charging pad its this pretty big pad and it was sort of inconspicuous at first i took out the box i was like yay cool another wireless charging pad but why is it smart so then i plugged it in and i started using it and i got it so this charging pad has one gimmick and one gimmick only its a 20 watt wireless charger and the number one thing it does is move that coil inside to find the device you put down somewhere on the charger and line up the charging coil automatically for you so its this huge pad on purpose and you can put your device down anywhere and then you can hear the motors move the coil inside to line it up so yeah not gonna lie i thought that was pretty cool when i first saw it uh its impressive that it does find the coils and line up every time no matter where you put it down uh it sort of takes away the pain of trying to line up your wireless charger perfectly every time you just kind of slap it down anywhere and youre good but on the other hand thats it thats thats all it does thats the whole thing i mean ive weirdly i posted this on twitter and some people said that there was multiple device support and i think thats kind of stretching the definition a little bit because when im using it i put one device down and it moves over the charging coil just like it should perfect charges that then i put a second device down and as long as the first one is charging nothing happens really the only thing that you could say is multiple device charging support is when i finish when it finishes charging the first one it moves then over to the second device and starts charging that which is cool so regular charging pad doesnt do that so you can leave several things i guess in theory on this pad overnight and itll eventually get all of them charged for you but its not charging more than one thing at once either way though not gonna lie i kind of love this thing its 20 watts is good enough for me its not super fast charging but thats a high enough rate and i just kind of leave this thing on my desk now and i just slap my phone down whenever i just need a couple extra percent battery and eventually itll have me covered thats pretty dope alright so next up is this little box right here this guy is called the hachi infinite m1 so hachi reached out and they wanted to sponsor a spot on a dope tech episode and they sent over this box and its a projector and im really glad they did now projectors usually pretty boring right but this one i can confidently say this is definitely the smartest projector ive ever seen so this one has a snapdragon 670 inside has up to six gigs of ram and 128 gigs of storage and it runs android 90 but customized into a ui they call infinite os so its basically basically a whole android tablet inside this guy and then you can see aside from the projection its got cameras and theres sensors at the front and the top plus a gyroscope inside keeping track of its orientation so the way this thing is angled basically you can put it up against the wall and itll project up to the wall or you can put it up against a flat surface like a desk or table and itll project down onto the table once you do itll automatically sort of start to calibrate itself and sharpen it up and once its done you have your projection but heres the catch its a touch screen projection so this ten point multitouch element kinda unlocks this giant tablet experience anywhere you can find a flat surface which youll start to realize is like all over the place and its actually a lot more responsive than i thought it would be maybe its because ive tried some pretty garbage gimmicky versions of this in the past but this one is really good basically the limitation is you still got to make sure youre not casting a shadow on the element you actually want to touch so if you want to hit this button for example dont block the light from above it you just got to come from the other side of the light and touch it and it works perfectly but once you get the hang of that its all green light you can literally play multiplayer games 1v1 against people whether its tictactoe or board games or pong or air hockey weve tried all of them and they all work and on top of all that its got a builtin battery so the thing is pretty portable so you dont have to find a plug everywhere you go you can be on a train basically and just plop this thing down and start using it like a tablet so now you can basically turn any surface into a giant gaming controller without the need of a phone or a tablet im sure youve played pong before but youve probably never played it on your kitchen counter or on a table and then in the os theres some other dedicated ai integrated apps theyve built with different themes for example theres an education feature where you can use physical objects like actual plastic letters to teach spelling because it uses image recognition from the cameras to tell if youve spelled something right or wrong theres a kitchen feature called future kitchen that lets you project recipes onto your kitchen counter for example or your cutting board and it guides you through cooking them on your counter and itll even use that camera to recognize ingredients you scan theres also even a fitness app where in one direction it points the workout program video onto the wall and then on the other side is the camera facing you and it helps correct your form and count your reps and track your body so really interesting stuff thats been benefiting from the ai engine in the snapdragon 670 chip and it just got me thinking about projectors in a way i honestly never did before so it is pretty expensive at the site its linked below its 999 so basically the value proposition is you can either get one really nice projector that only does one thing which is just sit in one room and project an image on a wall or you can get this sort of like swiss army knife smart projector touch screen ai focused image recognizing tablet thing that you can take anywhere and uh i think that qualifies as dope tech okay last but not least is this guy this is samsungs ipad pro killer thats being a bit generous but hear me out so this is the galaxy tab s7 plus its an android tablet and so this is the bigger one theres two the galaxy tab s7 and s7 plus and this guy you know android tablets used to be a lot more popular than they are now there just isnt that much competition in the android tablet space right now but this one as far as premium android tablets goes has a lot of good stuff going for it like its got the high end specs the snapdragon 865 plus which makes it 5g capable and theres up to eight gigs of ram and half a terabyte of storage and the design i think is nice its a really thin tablet probably thinner than the phone youre using right now but its metal its got sharp edges and it still fits quality quad speakers in all four corners and a 10 090 milliamp hour battery so it is not a poor useless pace and then you get a bunch of little things too theres dual cameras one 12 megapixel primary and one 5 megapixel ultra wide and theyre pretty good they dont have to be great because theyre tablet cameras but they are definitely functional and in fact the camera youll probably use more often on a tablet is the frontfacing camera which is up here in the middle of landscape mode which i love because most of the time youre using a tablet like this its going to be sideways its in landscape mode samsung knows this and puts the webcam in the better place unlike the ipad thats actually also why the fingerprint reader is over here on the right hand side because you hold it sideways and double tap and unlock it just like that easy and the bezels are thin but not too thin because if youre holding a tablet you do need some place to put your thumbs down and actually hold the thing so its got just the right amount of thickness to hold that bezel and not touch the screen its just an overall really nice design my favorite quirk though is the s pen it comes with so this is the new and improved s pen its got all the same improved technologies from the galaxy note series its the new nine millisecond response time all that fun low latency stuff but i say quark because its kind of like they saw what the ipad pro did with the apple pencil and said oh we like that were gonna do you mind if we copy that but sort of make it look like we change it up a little bit and so thats how we ended up with this they copied apples homework but changed it up just a little bit so the s pen only attaches and charges this certain way so its got to have the tip facing the cameras and in just the right spot and the magnets are nice but they just arent quite as strong so i cant do it blind as easily as the ipad maybe if i used it for longer id get a better hang of it but it just feels like it should be a little bit stronger and when you lay it down without the case now that its on the back it kind of props it up a bit because of the pen like is that what they wanted i dont know the case for it really is one of the best accessories you should get for this tablet but the reason the tab s7 plus makes dope tech is because of this screen this is the best yeah this is the best screen on any tablet including the ipad its a 12 inch 16 by 10 120 hertz super amoled display it gets super bright the colors are excellent and everything on this screen whether its videos or photos or games whatever it is it just looks super sharp and vibrant i mean this is seriously a great screen which i guess wed expect nothing less from a highend samsung product oh and yes this also does use the full quad hd resolution and 120 hertz at the same time i mean it is a tablet but its still nice to see this screen like if you want a media machine if you watch a lot of youtube netflix whatever you do like this is this is the screen you want to do it on and its lightweight enough that you can carry it around watch it on a plane this is the one so this is dope tech just because of the screen now it is still an android tablet so youre going to have a lot of partially unoptimized weirdly vertical not quite right apps and if youre willing to deal with that because thats part of the android tablet experience then the rest of this package might be interesting to you but i mean come on this screen is awesome so thats about it that wraps up this dope tech some pretty good stuff here but hey if you have other suggestions for stuff you want to see in dopetech in the future nows a good time to leave a comment in the comment section because theres a whole wide world out there of great stuff and weird stuff and quirky stuff and wed like to i would like to feature it on the channel i think its a lot of fun so thanks for watching this episode and uh well catch you guys later peace
oYhRPiVPA3c,the truth about the tech industry  keeping you buying more,Tech,hi guys welcome back to another hugh jeffries video in this video ill be talking about planned and perceived obsolescence and how companies use it to generate more sales in turn costing you money and creating more waste technology is evolving and without people purchasing products companies wouldnt have the money to research and develop new technologies like faster processes better cameras and faster storage but theyve also taught us that our products should only last a few short years according to a study i found the expected lifespan of a phone is between two to three years five for a laptop and seven if its a car thats really not a long time but its something most people have come to accept this rapid obsolescence isnt a new phenomenon in fact it dates back to the 1920s when a light bulb manufacturer realized they could double their sales by making each light bulb last half the amount of time this was done by making the filament thinner making the bulb burn out faster in modern times obsolescence is worse than ever a product doesnt have to be built to fail in hardware as computer systems can be programmed to become obsolete im facing this form of obsolescence right now with my apple led cinema displays as the monitors feature no physical buttons requiring the os to control the brightness but in mac os monterey the brightness controls have vanished and theyre now stuck at a low brightness i must use my computer with the blind down so i can properly see anything is this just a bug in their software or is this planned obsolescence after apple released their new studio display either way im not spending over 9 000 on three new apple monitors in 2017 apple admitted they programmed iphones to slow down as the battery degraded they will find 25 million euros they claim this was to prolong the life of these devices but personally i think it was done to make people perceive their phone was wearing out more than it really was making those new phones appear faster on the android side of things samsung faced controversy over a similar practice its game optimizing service was throttling even the latest flagship bones but conveniently switched off when using benchmarking tools this apparently was to prevent thermal issues with the phone this isnt the first time weve seen this practice take an iphone 4 4s or ipad 2 and 3 if you compare one on its factory shipping version of ios and the latest version supported youll find its basically unusable on the latest update but so fast and responsive on the old version ios updates effectively killed these devices to top it all off with apple preventing downgrading ios if you updated you essentially had a barely usable tablet of course ios versions are optimized to run best on the latest devices but i cant help to think that they just ran too slow to receive the update or maybe theyve just been made to run slow however after apple was fine for slowing down these older devices in 2017 this doesnt seem to be as big of an issue they do still throttle phones as the battery degrades but it shows you if its active and gives you an option to switch it off the last supported ios versions for the iphone 5 6 6s and 7 are usable and nothing like what we experienced with some of the older models in the android sphere things are a lot more diverse with so many different models and brands update support depends on each manufacturer some guarantee three or four years of android os updates and a similar or longer duration of security updates but then theres some companies that dont even provide one os upgrade but with such diversity comes fantastic app support android 6 released in 2015 can still run the latest version of most applications in contrast apples ios version that came out the same period ios 8 can barely install any of the popular applications anymore this is because apple doesnt make it easy for developers to target older versions of ios the latest version of xcode apples ios development software only supports back to ios 11 whereas android studio googles development software supports all the way back to android 4 which was introduced in 2011 contrary to popular belief android has much better app support after all newer os versions only really introduce new features or a new design security patch updates are what really matters only if google could streamline security updates so they didnt rely on each device manufacturer because the way it is now makes perfect devices obsolete if and when the manufacturer decides so my phone is the perfect example made by a certain fruit company im of course talking about blackberry for a company that specializes in security they dont even release security patch updates after two years in fact the previous model appears to run identical software that even includes hidden software and wallpapers that were only available on the newer model demonstrating both phones should have received the same software support but of course the older model fell subject to planned obsolescence in 2019 furthermore as the bootloader is locked no custom roms with newer versions of android or new security patches can be installed if your android was to have an unlocked bootloader with some technical work you could get a newer version installed further extending the life of the device now im sure a lot of people are thinking my phone looks old with its keyboard and headphone jack well thats whats called perceived obsolescence believe it or not this is another way companies entice consumers to purchase newer devices by adding a new color or slightly changing the design they distinguish the old model from the new one in fact in the last few years apple has been releasing a new colorway for its flagship phone six months into release recreating hype around the six month old phone and boosting sales phones have become status items does anyone really need a gold iphone 12 pro max inlaid with diamonds of course not but it sure looks good i covered this more in depth in my video on why companies really removed the charger and headphone jack but to summarise the removal of the jack allowed companies to sell additional headphones which in themselves became status items my 2010 mac pro lost update support around the time apple released the 2019 model even though my computer was beyond capable of running the newer operating system widely thanks to its extensive upgrade ability i was able to get it installed with some modifications and to no surprise it ran perfectly but even if you dont care about the newer models and the software isnt obsolete there is a method manufacturers are increasingly using to get you to buy the latest model and thats antirepair tactics for making it physically hard to replace something consumable like a battery or programming the software to reject the replacement part from working correctly i extensively cover this in my tear down and repair assessment videos while we mainly seen this antirepair software locking from apple other tech companies like samsung have also dipped their toes into it but thats if its even repairable a lot of newer desktops and laptops come with soldered on storage and ram not only preventing upgrades but also repair ssds are consumable and can wear out meaning you can no longer replace the 50 part instead you now have to replace the whole computer or mainboard costing you hundreds of dollars after much criticism apple has released a selfrepair program but the program didnt change any of the software issues impacting thirdparty repair their program still requires you to buy the part from apple install it and then get the part approved to remove the warning messages and artificial errors that appear after the part has been replaced but the worst part is performing the repair yourself using apples selfrepair program can cost you more than just taking it to apple making the program meaningless to most customers and with apple controlling its pricing they really just can make it close to or more than buying a new one my sisterinlaw has an iphone 7 with a broken home button as apple pairs each home button to each iphone im not able to replace it apple doesnt offer a home button replacement and instead replaces the button as part of a screen replacement despite this phone not needing a new display the problem the screen replacement from apple costs more than the whole phone is worth there are thirdparty buttons that aim to bypass apples lock i did install one into this phone but it didnt work all the time and eventually stopped working entirely so shes looking at getting a new phone this forced obsolescence really does work in the car industry brands like tesla have been doing similar things from fighting against right to repair to making it hard for unauthorised service providers to repair their cars but its not just tesla mechanics are facing similar issues with other brands to do with software pairing in the automotive industry this anticonsumerism technology is even in most printers have you ever tried to install thirdparty or refilled ink you know exactly what i mean not enough is being done to stop this madness right to repair laws havent been widely adopted and current laws dont seem to be preventing this planned obsolescence were living in a world where we dont really own anything and we havent even talked about digital purchases and subscriptions electronics should last a minimum of 10 years not two or three i still use the 16 year old ipod almost every day because it has no planned obsolescence built in it was designed to play music and thats exactly what it still does its highly modifiable and ive even upgraded it with an msata ssd and larger battery well how about this radio from the 1930s or 40s australian made and still going strong music or even my 1935 dodge with its original engine thats never been rebuilt repair on this car is as simple as it gets the fact finding common parts like a water pump or brake cylinder for an 87 year old car is easier than most modern technology is astounding of course with its fuel consumption and top speed of only 75 kilometers an hour its not a practical daily driver but it demonstrates things can be built to last and that most products today are not only designed to fail but to be unfixable im not opposed to buying something new especially if it has value like replacing a 12 year old computer with a new one to be able to edit videos faster but i should be the one in control of when i update not some company but theres some positives germanys proposing legislation that would make smartphone oems offer seven years of software updates and the eu is also proposing the digital markets act to help prevent anticompetitive conduct this includes having different messaging services work together the ability to use thirdparty app stores or the right to be able to remove bloatware from your device but these have yet to come into effect however the eu has passed law that will come into effect in late 2024 forcing the standardization of usbc a law only really affecting apple has used its own proprietary connector since 2004 in terms of repair right to repair bills have been proposed in countries like the eu us and australia all being in various states and for the most part not in full force but given some time we might begin to see a shift in both laws circumventing anticonsumerism practices and peoples perceived lifespan of products and on that note this has been a huge jefferies video if you like what you saw hit that subscribe button and consider checking out the teardown and repair assessment playlist for more videos just like this one and if youre looking for any used devices be sure to check out my online store link which is down in the description thats all for this video and ill catch you guys next time
xj6GikPbhdQ,i will never financially recover from this,Tech,ten thousand dollars of plastic chips ow not to mention the 2500 special box to look at them in 20 grand worth of mannequins looking good bro everyone here seems to want a mac literally thousands of dollars of neodymium magnets nine thousand dollars in network gear a small apartment for some reason expensive edition pillow anyone youve undoubtedly heard me mention lttstorecom but what you might not know is that weve got a dedicated facility with over a dozen staff who work here which means that this place is an absolute freaking cash sink which is why im extremely grateful to sponsors like robo rock for sending over their s7 max v ultra this bad boy does dirt it does mopping it automatically switches between them and even docks itself the ultra model that is anyway empties out its dirty water empties out its solid waste refills its water tank its freaking amazing and you know who cleans up every other mess around here lets start in customer care weve got adam there and im filling in for nolan these guys care so much about answering your support tickets as fast as possible that theyve got 300 hertz displays why do you guys need gaming laptops of course you guys didnt tune in to see the stuff we already made lets leak some stuff were working on an obvious one is socks and sandals so what youre looking at here is basically every prototype ltt sock that weve ever brought in the problem is that while many of these are pretty good and some are really good none of them are as good as my daily drivers from darn tough so until we can match this level of quality we just arent going to do it as for the sandals the cost of doing the plastic molds for all the different sizes is going to be astronomical so its a project we keep kind of kicking down the road heres why this hoodie was delayed for about a year see the gradient here from up close it looks like absolute dog by comparison heres what the final one ended up looking like its a much smoother gradient oh this is cool ill be able to give more details later but in a nutshell this is a modular acoustic panel system that promises to offer a balance between the cost of diy and the convenience of like a predone commercial kit supposed to just kind of snap together and theres going to be all different shapes but first fashion unfortunately bridget our senior designer is not in today but thats okay matthews here hes actually working on some baseball cap concepts a lot of what youre gonna see in this corner of the office is gonna be at very very early stages of development a reversible bomber jacket why reversible you might ask because who wouldnt want to wear an interlocked ltt logo bomber jacket see it says ltt all over it that was a matthew innovation music theres lots more going on here too weve got the super comfy pajama pants the retro inspired polar fleece weve got the tech pants weve got the 3d down printed jacket thing this thing is so freaking warm swim trunks lots more colors of our plaid flannels that have gotten such amazing reviews and my personal favorite that matthew is working on right now where is this one oh yeah were doing a tracksuit this weve leaked before but weve got a second round of samples of what will be the wag hoodie theyre not going to be cheap because theyre actually built to the same standard as the regular man hoodie but theyll definitely be stylish we dont have air conditioning in this building yet they quoted me a hundred grand to do this place its only four thousand square feet so i go back to them like hey why are you quoting ducted ac why dont you quote mini splits and they come back and its like a quarter its madness what are you working on oh i dont think were talking about this right no we dont talk about that wait we have a fullsize run of wag hoodie yeah i didnt know we were that close on this and finally were restocking our classic colors of the ltt underwear we have ended up switching suppliers for these i think four or five times whether its come down to print quality factory conditions supply lead i dont i dont know what all the different reasons have been but its been really frustrating and we are finally ready to go again with something that meets our standards so yay in here is the archive this is where youll find one of pretty much everything so if we ever had to dig up an old garment some of the samples that we bought from other companies just for inspiration or for competitive testing for example this is one of all of our original run of our colored tees that way we have something to compare against if we get a subsequent order and the color or the materials or whatever else is way off obviously with such treasures as the last remaining brand new lambo edition beanies in here security is a big priority so massive shout out ubiquity unparalleled image quality the apps amazing theyre all poe so you just have to run a network cable to wherever you go they have ai detection for people and events which actually ties perfectly into our sponsor robo rock also uses machine learning for their reactive ai 20 obstacle avoidance theyve got cameras for out in front and they can recognize and avoid up to 27 types of obstacles so theres no need to pick up hazards off your floor which is good because our floors full of lots of hazards like all these 40 oz water bottles and this giant tv its got five different suction modes including up to 5100 pascal suction so itll pick up just about anything you throw at it and their viberized mopping system scrubs your floor rather than just vacuuming this place has a whopping three bathrooms this bathroom has a toilet right here behind the door and then youve got a door out to engineering on this side sup engineering nice nickname thanks its a liao original the 90s you got a lot of smart comments for someone who hasnt launched a product in the 18 months hes worked here oh here they are the first we thought they were golden samples but then we actually found one last problem that is now fixed because of community feedback we will be launching it in both silver and black shaft variants by the way and it will be available in orange black and black black colorways so a little something like that the reality is when you want to not just match but beat respected experienced tool manufacturers like these guys its just a nontrivial task weve got the back force oh so good its so light weve got the sound great but getting that tactile click on the selector thats taken some doing its the little details that matter okay whats he got in here 3d printed early handle designs theres going to be a whole video about this whole thing last taiwan ratchet because we had that whole thing where our supplier for the ratchets got bought by dont put that in please to all the people who think that we supposedly just still screened our logo onto a megapro driver heres a megapro driver heres ours does that look like the same driver no i didnt think so theres a big difference between licensing someones patent and putting your logo on their product ooh the network closet man one of the coolest projects we did for the build out here was their air fiber internet connection theyre connected to the main office which is about 50 paces that way by a dish that comes into this switch set up right here also from ubiquity and then is distributed to the entire building have you guys had so much as a hiccup in your internet connectivity yes what are the sfp connections yeah from these uh i mean other than that one other than that one no but like every time those decide to flip an update we lose internet for five minutes oh really it happens in the middle of a freaking day have you told jake im sure that can be yeah oh yes if you didnt get software updates youd be crying theres no software in the middle of the workday i mean he says hes working but have they shipped a product yet i mean do you want do you want just your driver not where you want to put it right now probably you hit all your stuff yeah its all over there potentially a super open gaming mouse this is kind of an early concept for what the ergonomics might be like you can see its 3d printed our intention would be to release all the schematics so you could actually 3d print your own enclosure for it if you really wanted but with highend hardware and we mean highend thousand hertz pulling well get there were at like 700 now right were at 700 over bluetooth ish and a thousand over usb still some work to do but we also want to make it so that you can easily swap out the switches it should basically be the last mouse we cant call it dont put that in oh my god theres been so many revisions of the acoustic panels oh yeah good gravy hexagons i think that were pretty settled on this snap together mechanism that you came up with yeah so itll clip together and clip apart you dont need any tools to build it oh and this is another tynan project which is a lot more difficult than you might think okay this is so close to launch only one small problem if you want to launch a childrens product theres all these certifications and stuff that you have to go through basically theres this small parts cylinder test fixture thing and you have to make sure that nothing fits in there because that determines whether its a choking hazard and then theres the like the paints and varnishes that you use but itll be a while before it sees the light of day its not just kyle the whole engineering department actually hasnt launched a product yet what do you got jacob would you believe this man spent weeks of his life learning the optimal ways to position magnets for maximum grab force i actually have the simulation up on my computer right now do you really uh yeah the geometry is basically rotationally symmetric you can distill threedimensional physics down to twodimensional stuff so here ive got a crosssection of the magnet and you can imagine that if we were to take the rotator really was a ton of work that he put into this whole make them as strong as possible thing but i think it paid off i mean not yet because they havent shipped a product yet but do you have anything else going on all right we have the joystick lock can you give me an old prototype that doesnt work very well uh just about anything basically we identified a problem and the problem is that joysticks like die if youre transporting them theyre very likely to end up kind of mashed against something in your bag or whatever else the case may be so we set out to solve the aforementioned problem with some kind of support mechanism for the joystick to keep it from getting bumped and jostled when its being moved around more workstations for when we hire more engineers which we might do once we ship some screwdrivers this is a cool one im really not gonna tell you what this is no im not gonna tell them what this is oh wheres the wheres the shoe dryer its in a place in my in my docket called silicon hell right now shout out to any pcb designer that has to redesign their board certain times to release a product because as soon as you design something it sells out well its a batterypowered fan that will basically like dry your shoes or dry out your gym bag its just because i wanted one and also because a lot of the engineering work to build it would be applicable to other projects like rgb doormat or whatever whod pay someone to put that its only an idiot yeah theres a haircut hello linus you need to come upstairs yeah id love to i just gotta run to the washroom first well dont follow me in here weirdo aside from video calling the app includes a 3d mapping feature that you can even decorate with furniture like your space not that this particular space is particularly furnished hello hi sarah what are you working on um just some secret things can we talk about this yet i mean future water bottle design capacitor inspired oh and this is a new desk pad whats the inspiration for this one all of these graphs represent some sort of statistic based on our channel this would be our male to female viewership right you know it and the coolest feature is the qr code that we have included will take you to our latest uploaded ltt video we should definitely uh go to never give you up oh limited edition golden controller plushie is this the one we settled on yes yes sarah does all of our sticker pack designs and this is our new ecofriendly packaging for the 2022 pack right yep this is 2021 what else you got going on sarah all our postcards fun are these all the ones that have arrived so far yes were gonna make a wall of them so if you get an ltt store uh gpu wasteland coloring card you can send it back to us and then we can add it to our wall in the future yeah you guys should totally do it weve gotten so wow some of these are amazing look at this one how fun is that it warms my heart every day that i receive i love it this is nick and natalies office they are both out of office today nicks got a prototype desk pad though this one will never see the light of day because i didnt like the pixelated ltt logo but its kind of cool right i dont even fully understand what this room is i see packaging mockups hey sarah do you have that super cool shoelaces package heres our packaging for our shoelaces wait whats this called again the the net color nib yeah yeah yeah we have a gray version of this tshirt thats also got the little color flex in it and the drawstrings were gonna have matching shoelaces and theyre gonna come in a little power supply box how cute is that and then theyll stick out like this what else is going on in here our temp set coffee mugs never found anything oh yeah bananas for scale various versions of a potential wan toque or beanie the illfated coasters yeah these were super cool too bad they all broke in shipping um a gpu pillow with rgb ooh this is fun these wont be launched by the time this video comes out but theyll be very close thats right 64 ounce versions of our circuit board water bottles now we get to the really weird part of the tour the people that we bought this unit from managed to get the permit for the caretaker suite so they were actually living upstairs the layout was super weird you had to go all the way around engineering all the way back up through fashion and all the way up to get to that side we decided to open it up and this is now the employee lunchroom weve got a washer and a dryer which it wouldnt surprise me to find things inside yep this is our color block hoodie and one of the big challenges that we ran into with this one was that the bold colors were bleeding onto the light colors in the wash so this is a new sample thats treated in a way that will not allow that to happen and as you can see see any color bleed yeah you dont one nice thing that the previous owners did theres like 60 ethernet jacks in this 4 000 square foot place there should be plenty of network connectivity like look at the size of this room okay this is a linus for scale how could i possibly hope to cram four people in here unless i start stacking them lloyd you moved your desk i went over there and i was like lloyd still works here right sarahs like oh yeah yeah yeah yeah whats the deal it was too hot all right well ill just move to where the air conditioning is okay that makes sense well no ones using it well what is wearing a sweater what is happening what are you working on right now lloyd what can we leak to the people just trying okay anything else to show the people come on its the people yeah were thinking of doing like a laser cut wooden bookmark these ones are a little on the thick side still and we unfortunately cut them out going the wrong way with the grain so they like snap in half which is not a desirable quality but were working on it its early stages this is gonna be a little like its like a soft silicone kind of a lamp so its gonna look kind of like that and then itll be opaque all around it and the screen will glow whatever color you want and its probably not watching you sleep yeah no camera no camera heres the front stairs which you havent even seen yet these are a real time saver this ones not particularly fancy this is from like two or three years ago and its got detachable arms just in case youre into that sort of thing but we have some custom models coming that are like five grand a pop and why basically custom size so it can fit to our standard medium size so its our like nerdy techie meeting yes you cant really put pants on it too well well we tried yeah we had to take off solid put a solid effort into put yeah i gotta say the pajama pants which is what we have on here kind of flattering actually yeah as for the color viewing room i wasnt kidding about the cost ten thousand dollars for these plastic chips i already talked about that this has five different lighting modes so youve got daylight store light because thats where people make a purchasing decision when theyre not shopping online like you know modern people home light and uv light 2 500 bucks for that oh and it gets even better this group of booklets so these are cotton chips how much were these three twenty seven we dont actually know how much these bros books cost because we got them from a supplier then you also need the paper ones the best part of these ones is youre supposed to replace them i think every 18 months and theyre like a few hundred bucks every single time why do we have so many of these oh theyre all different fashion home plus formula guide solid coated i mean for real though it matters if i show this to you you would say what color is it black okay if i show this to you what color is it black okay are these the same color no no im sorry what is this thing i just glossed over this so just put your fabric here and then itll cut this exact diameter of a circle yeah and then you would weigh that onto the scales then you convert that to right grams per square meter and thats how we determine the weights of all our fabrics and its really important that we validate this stuff ourselves because weve had suppliers lie to us about everything from the weight of the fabric to the colors that they use to the treatments that they apply to even the composition of the fabric and then we also had like some instances where the screen printer had like burn issues so then we had to double check the composition to make sure that it was poly cotton and not something else mixed in there speaking of burning fabric weve got a behind the scenes over on float plane where i accidentally set our props on fire not once but twice ive been informed that this bathroom has some special equipment in it oh i see a fancy steamer commercial now really theres a commercial grade steamer what did this cost uh 275 oh well thats pretty cheap especially when you compare it to all the like lab tests that we do every time we notice something could be a problem or we have a manufacturer make a marketing claim to us like for example the 3d down jacket the manufacturer was making some pretty bold claims about the waterproofness of the material so we went well i mean we could take your word for it but i am so excited for this one were targeting fall right its a jacket so hopefully yeah you say that but its not gonna be cheap but its like really nice heres the shoelaces i was talking about earlier this is part of our rgb line so thats why it has an rgb thing inside where the tags attach i dont know what this parts called does this have a name neck binding thanks thats a less cool name than i was hoping for oh right right i was going to show you the shoelace you could have matching shoelaces and drawstring if you want to look what is it on fleek do the kids say on fleek still im hearing a lot of no and im hearing a lot of opportunity to bring things back around to robo rock our sponsor these puppies have been saving us from ourselves one of our

Y8IV-vmsGJ0,jeanine pirro bidens administration finally admits the president flat out lied,News,new york city welcome to the five the biden administration finally admitting the president flat out lied when he accused border patrol agents of whipping migrants pier the head of the border patrol announcing the results of a monthlong investigation into the incident where democrats and the media claimed the agents were striking illegal border crossers  after an extensive review the us attorney issued their decision not to prosecute the case opr found no evidence for the border patrol agents involved in this incident that struck any person with their rain intentionally or otherwise  judge jeanine the false claims the border agents whipping migrants was quickly debunked but remember that didnt stop the biden administration from smearing the border patrol on horseback who were just doing their job  to see people treated like they did horses running over people being strapped it is outrageous i promise you those people will pay  as we all know it invokes images of some of the worst moments of our history where that kind of behavior has been used against the indigenous people of our country and against african americans during times of slavery  i saw horrifying images that do not reflect who we are who we aspire to be or the integrity and values are truly a role of personal and the department of homeland security  the horrific video at the cdp officers on horses using brutal and inappropriate measures against innocent people  judge jeanine the four agents arent out of the was just yet they are being referred for punishment for using offensive language and unnecessary force the agents could be suspended for up to 14 days unfortunately border patrol is not the only ones being attacked by the biden administration pier at the white house white house is accusing texas governor greg abbott of causing chaos over his move with illegal immigrants back to where they came from  i will say this the immigration enforcement is a federal authority and state should not be mandating it or meddling in it that is just especially governor texas governor abbott who has a track record of causing chaos and confusion at the border but again this is immigration enforcement and a federal authority  judge jeanine jessica and i will start with you pier the fact is that the president didnt just lie here but you had the most powerful man in the country the most powerful woman in the country vice president and you had maxine waters and the rest of them you got them prejudging a situation creating a false narrative while these powerful people and they were just wrong i mean should they be in these positions making these judgments given the fact that they didnt even know what the facts were at that time  jessica i will say joe biden should not be president because he got this wrong or kamala harris  judge jeanine it is real simple  jessica he should backtrack and say he is wrong they have a 511 page report to refer to they did find there was failure of multiple levels of the agency lack of training dangerous behavior et cetera and they have to deal with but when you publicly demonize someone or an organization or institution it does damage the institution obviously enter those that support them this is something that even democrats who are representing constituencies along the border were saying this is actually how it is supposed to be im not typically someone who rides a horse and i did not know what was supposed to be going o we should eat crow on this particular one and say we are wrong on this and these are the reports so this doesnt happen again and move on  judge jeanine isnt it their job joey on the border patrol to make sure things at the border go smoothly and to not let there be chaos at the border and im not even addressing the issue   joey 40 something years and the government and the men on that horse that is the heart of this problem there is the american people and then the elite class that think they get to govern them to stand there and accuse them of the egregious thing in the world to be racist and trying to whip people when they are trying to enforce a policy that this administration ideologically stands fundamentally against think about the entire agency of government whose mandate is to enforce the border and control the border and they have people at the white house who are fundamentally and ideologicallyt notion so what do they do they use it as a scapegoat demonize them and any technicality they say they will punish them because of offensive language dont you think racial slur that is exactly what they did they probably said get the hill back  jessica the report of what they did say  joey richard phelan said we have some standing agreement or policy to let specifically of people haiti in the country we do at the border checkpoint and push those people towards the border all day long that is what they are trying to do and only a horse can go and you see the men or women on horseback they go while matt those are people that will do anything to protect this countr they see a man in the white house who cant get the sentence out of his mouth and accuse them of things that man is not fit to be present there president  judge jeanine not only unfit but if he sees something on a videotape and makes a judgment what the hell is he doing on the world stage with leaders who are playing him like a fiddle  jessica hes turning on the very agents whose mission is to protect the american people to secure the border and economic prosperity of the united states of america that is the mission of border patrol this is a perfect example of  they are punishing these guys and took them off the front line they took the horse patrol unit off of that part of the border making it easier for the cartel and criminal elements to operate they were doing their job trying to protect the american people from illegal immigrants it doesnt matter where they are from illegal immigrants coming across the border illegally without permission we dont know who these people are peer they have no paperwork we dont know who they are and tons of criminals coming across the border they just simply did their job for joe biden to get up and say immediately they were guilty and that they would be punished today you have custom and border protection come out and say there is no evidence they did anything wrong they will still be punished is the very definition of a political witch hunt an abuse of power and i hope these agents have recourse at some point for secretary may work as from the beginning to say they werent whipping anybody they dont even have reigns he defended them initially until he got a phone call from the white house to save joe bidens ego and pride because he lied about what happened and continue that narrative for the sake of the people who are pushing it it is despicable and disgusting and exactly what is wrong with the portal policy in general  judge jeanine you know greg when you think about it the idea of going after border patrol who they put at the border on horses who they say protect the american people and then they want to punish them when we have got how many pounds of fentanyl coming into the country on any given day killing americans and they are worried about this situation and they are not even checking for the fentanyl  greg if you want a definition of a truly dystopian universe it is when the authority tells you that youve done nothing wrong but you are still getting punished i mean it is the oldline show me the person and i will show you the crime that is exactly what this is this would make proud and right up there with two plus two equals five were orwell 1984 we found nothing wrong but you will be sentenced to five years of hard labor that is the thing that i think should discussed everybody in terms of offensive language the real offensive language was comparing border patrol to slave owners and calling  the useless language that is dramatic language it is horrific brittle they will pay it is like that rash hyper dramatic tweet that gets all of the attention and when it turns out you are dead wrong the correction is a little mouse squeak and nobody the new york times putting up on page b 35 so no one finds it this is important for a lot of reasons the democrats and the media to not care about an issue until an american villain to amplify there was a lot of bad stuff going on at the border you bring up fentanyl there was a lot of chaos suffering coyotes rape that there is no story and that an american darth vader you know how desperate we were on the show to get people to cover the border and then come all of a sudden the spigot that was turned on not turned on in full force and then around the clock and it was incredible it was another colluding enterprise of media and democratic party to create a hoax this is why people have lost trust in the media they have lost trust in the government they have seen the drinking bleach hoax the russian collusion hoax they see the democrats in the media in bed together and they cant trust them then they amplify the story and they bury others so we talked about the hunter biden stuff being buried but 50 plus migrants died in a truck driven by a meth head that story got what a half an hour think about that biden cared mo

2Yt6raj-S1M,how school makes kids less intelligent  eddy zhong  tedxyouthbeaconstreet,Education,translator yulia kallistratova reviewer denise rq i want to share with you a big secret today and its not one that a lot of you are going to want to hear but at the same time its so important that i have to tell you that secret is this what if i told you that every singe day kids go to school they become less intelligent now how could that be possible when kids go to school they learn things right and they accumulate more knowledge so if anything they should be getting smarter how could they possibly be getting less intelligent what am i talking about well i do hope to illustrate that to you today before i turned 14 i was a kid that did not know what he wanted in life so usually when you go up to a 5 or 6 year old and you ask him what do you want to be when you grow up hell say  an astronaut or a businessman i wanted to be a professional call of duty player laughter and since i had no idea about what i wanted to be when i grew up i just listened to my parents almost 100 of the time i trusted that they knew what was best for me my parents wanted out of me what any typical parent would want out of his child go to school keep up your grades get out and exercise once every few years laughter and i was trying to do everything they asked of me except the problem was i wasnt even that good at school i was terrible at science could not write a 5paragraph essay if my life had depended on it and to this day i still think im the only asian kid in the world who does not understand math laughter i really do but when i turned 14 that all changed i was no longer this hot air balloon and floating around in space i was now like a supersonic jet flying toward my destination at 50000 miles an hour or however fast those things go this change all started when i received an envelope with the mail it was an invitation  not to a birthday party i did not get any of those  not to a playground but to a business plan competition down in boston and i was curious i was just so curious that i had to go the program director explained to us that over five months we would form a team develop a business idea and present this idea to a panel of judges who would be judging us how good our suits are and how good our business ideas were and a long story short over those five months i formed a team developed an idea and we actually ended up winning that competition and taking home a check and that one event sparked my interest for going to more and more of these competitions over the next two years of my life i actually went to dozens and dozens of these competitions and i was winning almost all of them and i realized that i liked going to them so much not just because i liked winning them but also because i had an unrealized passion that was a passion for creating things because the one thing that my team would do differently from our other competitors every single time was well everyone would go up and present their idea and their powerpoint we would go to a home depot buy supplies and actually build the idea we were talking about and the judges were just so blown away by the fact that a bunch of teenagers could go and create things can make prototypes and have minimum viable products we won almost every single competition just because the judges loved that we had gone and executed it at one of these competitions i met a shorttempered middleaged polish guy named frank if he is here today id better run after this laughter he came up to us took a look at our prototype and said i can help you guys turn this into a real company think about that isnt that cool we are 16 years olds we are going out into the world and creating a real hardware technology startup at first we were all like time to be steve jobs lets go build apple dropping out of school now but we quickly realized its not that easy so dont drop out unless youre really sure you have a good idea but laughter weve realized that the first part to building a great company is to assemble a great team and as students we couldnt go to bars to network to networking events for adults so we went to our school and set up this little presentation in our auditorium in which we would present our idea and hopefully kids would join our team we sent out an invitation to our entire school and the first thing we noticed is that almost no one showed up there was almost no interest and those who did show up spread the rumor around the school and throughout that week we were actually marked we were made fun of for our ideas and for being wannabe mark zuckerbergs laughter whats funny is the next week after we took the exact same presentation and did it at our elementary school so to kids who were 5 or 6 years younger and the response was phenomenal these kids were throwing their lunch money at us asking if they could buy a prototype laughter they were asking for our premoney valuation which i know you guys know from watching shark tank but it was amazing that these kids even knew terms like that existed when they were too young to even probably pronounce some of these words that just inspired me so much and i think this is what our education system has done over just these 5 to 6 years in the education system these creative children have turned into these teenagers that are unwilling to think outside of the box so lets go back to that secret i was talking about how is it possible that school is making kids less intelligent the fact is there is so much more than just one type of intelligence while school can make you more academically intelligent it can teach you physics algebra calculus it is diminishing the childrens creative intelligence it is teaching them to think in a certain way to go down a certain path in life its telling them go to high school get a diploma go to a good college find a stable job and if you dont do that you wont be successful and if that was true how am i even standing here today how did i a straight c student start a technology company at the age of 16 and how is my company which was featured on a wall street journal last week doing better that some of the companies started by harvard and stanford graduates it must be something that cant be measured by academic intelligence alone so here is what i believe parents teachers educators you have the power to influence and inspire youth the fact is there are way too many people out there right now who are obsessed with telling kids to go to college to find a good job and to be successful there are not enough who are telling kids to explore more possibilities to become entrepreneurs and if theres one message that i want parents kids and all of you to take away from what ive said here today is that you can open your own doors that you can stray away from this conventional limited and narrow path that education sets us upon you can diverge and create your own future you can start your own companies and start your own nonprofits you can create you can innovate and if theres one message i want you to take away from everything ive said it is this no one has ever changed the world by doing what the world has told them to do thank you applause
T4PFt4czJw0,uk doctor switches to 80 ultraprocessed food diet for 30 days  bbc,Food,im going to switch from my normal healthy diet its pretty healthy i eat about 20 ultra processed food to an 80 ultra processed food diet and that is the same diet sounds extreme but its the same diet that around one in five people in the uk eat so i want to find out if changing just doing nothing but changing the proportion of ultra processed food in my diet has any effect on my health my experiment will be run by one of britains top obesity experts to make sure the results will be scientifically valid my first meal is a national favorite fried chicken music its the end of the first day i dont want any anyone to interrupt my oh my god it was really good how about hot its crunchy on the outside and salty quite peppery the chickens moist what makes it ultra processed is the chemicals that are added like monosodium glutamate sodium phosphates and spice extracts to name just a few is it good its like tickling some weird bit of my brain its like crisps this is my crisps oh yeah exactly it would be impossible for me to not eat ive eaten three of these music the reason i ate these lasagnas the whole time is because theyre tasty they are really quick ive got to admire the science that goes into this sort of stringy stringy cheesy bits i know im going to finish this and immediately want another one this is all in the name of science music my observation is simply this is delicious and if i was served this in some amazing fancy restaurant as a dessert that id never experienced before i think it was a bit of sort of culinary genius you get the bowl of dry cereal you pour on the milk the milk goes brown the texture changes its all snapping and crackling you know an amazing bit of food engineering music the rules of my experiment are that i eat whenever i feel hungry which is what i always do but previously that meant eating three meals a day with the occasional snack now i find myself craving food much more often music im entering week two of my changed diet now what im having lyra is a stuffed crust meat feast pizza encourage her sorry i never would have thought of this but when you read this very long list of ingredients it just makes you think much more deeply about like what am i tasting and what are they trying to get me to taste and how does this all feel in my mouth this is definitely what the scientific paper is called sorry hyperpolishable so its just really really really eatable delicious food its really hard to stop eating part of that is because its so soft its like its got a crunchy bit hmm what you dont have to do hard im not getting tired you are a poon baby im gonna im gonna im gonna pick you up so you can poo in comfort sorry im having the opposite problem from baby sasha i dont know what this is about this is just a video of me not having a poo but needing a poo im definitely gonna get piles music and im also taking my diet on holiday music ive gone camping i spent the whole day eating motorway junk and went to bed in my head also in the camper van with the brothersinlaw and the brother i wonder if im gonna get physically used to it so i dont wake up every morning feeling hungover because of the salt and the sugar and that and the fact i havent done a poo in 48 hours music its one of my five a day so its healthy and its actually got its actually green on the traffic light system for saturation sugars so this has all the appearances of a healthy meal some foods that look pretty healthy can still count as ultra processed foods because theyre industrially produced and have multiple chemicals in the ingredients list our fiber source of protein gluten free im three weeks into my 80 ultra processed food diet to measure how it affects my body and theres only seven days to go time for some pudding flavored with delicious potassium sorbate you can really taste the potassium sorbate im not enjoying it but i cant stop its not like married its um four am ive had to come to the kitchen i cant sleep ive got a heartburn ive got a headache i feel like eating more food its nice having a cat when youre up at night well lets start with how you were when we started so four weeks ago magnificent what would you say a standard man in early middle age yeah that is you after i have the increasing man boob and also your stomach is looks quite yeah your weight went up by 65 kilograms in four weeks thats quite a lot isnt it and your body mass index went up by two points which took you into the overweight range and then the body fat went up by three kilos if the weight gain continued at that rate for six months i would gain six stone next are my hormone levels im particularly interested in the ones that tell my body if im hungry or full have they changed and what we found is that the hunger hormone in your blood went up by 30 percent once youve been on the diet so thats why i felt hungrier yes and what about the hormone that makes me feel full we saw a decrease in the fullness hormone so youve got a double whammy youve got an increase in the hunger hormone and a decrease in the hormone thats telling your brain that youve eaten finally professor batam wants to know if eating a high ultra processed food diet has affected my brain weve repeated the scan from a month ago to compare the results blue is how areas of your brain talk to each other before the diet and the red are the new functional connections in your brain after four weeks on the diet so everything thats red is a new connection between parts of your brain that wasnt there before comparing these scans has revealed that my diet has linked up the reward centers of my brain with the areas that drive repetitive automatic behavior so eating ultra processed food has become something my brain simply tells me to do without me even wanting it shockingly this is something you might see in a person with addiction if you just took people and scanned them at four week intervals you dont normally see a bunch of connections change that that does seem to be a real result yeah this is terrifying isnt it i mean i really really didnt expect this when i came in this morning no surprise i was surprised by the changes in the mri scan really surprised with just four weeks my concern is that childrens brains are still developing and theyre much more malleable than mine which means the changes are likely to be even greater there are lots of children in this country who are on my diet from a very early age do we have any idea what thats doing to them no but the other thing is chris im a mum and when i look at what ive been feeding my children then actually they were having quite a lot of ultraprocessed food really even as a obesity expert its made me far more aware about what im actually giving my children you
iiByqenA9tE,listen to this everyday to change your life  2019 motivational workout speech by billy alsbrooks,Motivation,your mouth is the creative weapon its not a tool for distributing excuses the first sign of a loser is an excuse champions take full responsibility good or bad for their outcomes tell the world one time what youre gonna do and thats it just being less time talking and more time grinding think like a champion speak like a chimp and then walk it out cry 120 oh day every day stop making excuses champ is make adjustments that excuses since the fabian average you invited an enemy manioc pudding is a dream killer nut coax young train jonzes yobbos is not the problem is some consistency you gotta make a decision how bad do you want is on the level success is only right you gotta choose a champions workout doesnt officially begin until painting arrives to see greatness is wet on the other side of pain so what are you running from it for you say you want to be successful then push early stop making excuses and go get it very few battles are won under ideal circumstances so you gotta simulate and practice the unknown so that the unexpected will not derailed you every morning when you get up ask yourself how can i put myself in a place where ill be uncomfortable say you have to master the unknown you gotta master your fears you gotta master the unexpected so when it happens you are prepared champions can push through and keep going when everyone else around them is quitting they have immerse themselves in pain so often did they have becoming new to it greatness is on the other side of pain dont get it the you expose yourself to pain the war comfortable you will become in his presence like champions doesnt officially start till paint arrives everything else this is the woman a boxer can be technician in the world and the first time he gets it he thought oh the party hes not gonna be a champion i tell you that seeing like mr psyche that with us were good until we get hit in the face but what separates champions from the is when they do here they keep coming second time they can swap dont im delighted soup and youre still standing the world would know theres a champion and the break successful do you wanna get hit in the face what lifes gonna do to you its gonna meet you when you got your guard down how do you respond refuse to let the world break you so late what its hampton looks like emilios brookes blessed in unstoppable what kind of life do you want to live success is a choice its a decision and only you can make for you first comes the choice then comes the commitment are you willing to commit to join what it takes to go where you want to go a lot of people say they want to be successful but they struggle and they supple on that commitment part a lot of times the only way we will make that commitment is we have to hit rock bottom we have to get so sick and tired of feeling the way we do before whatever will take the action needed to crawl up out of that pit i think youre ready i think youre ready you wouldnt be listening to me right now i think you know if you have greatness on the inside of you and you just need somebody to speak over your life and thats what im gonna do right now i speak greatness over you i rise champion im speaking of somebody out there the reason you feel so uncomfortable on the inside its because you know youre not being the best version of you that you can be that discomfort is trying to move you from where youre at to where you belong your destiny is blindness and you know this on the inside and that voice just keeps on calling and youre never gonna have the peace until you go become who you are supposed to be now were gonna send this change in motion for you right now i want you to say this with me i want you to say this out loud i am ready to change my i am willing and committed to go on all in and fully commit to doing the things that it takes to become the person i was meant to be and that starts right now all excuses stop right now i will not from this point forward when the plane and anybody else for my destiny i will take responsibility for who i want to be i will get up every day and work toward that person that ive known that i am on the inside i pledge when all my actions allegiance to success i will search deep down inside wow that will allow me to run through walls with it because i will not be tonight champions put in place the habits and daily rituals that manufacture success they push themselves constantly to the plot of pain and by refusing to tap out to that pain they eventually give birth to greatness pain is no match for a real champion the legends understand to be a winner one must be comfortable and being uncomfortable the dark the unknown the fears that stop each and every one of us must be faced and faced along for the we go through the fire the more refined we become those struck trials and tribulations they mold and shape us to care us for the calling and avista come to perform under stress under duress and without hesitation because perfect practice consistently makes one perfect all the time the inner standard of a champion sets him apart from the masses the wannabes and the uncommitted legends refuse to settle for mediocrity for them being average is the plague and totally unacceptable champions go all in all the time not this on game day when practice is over for the team the word for the champion says begins they understand the process and what is required to be elite to be great to be the best it requires obsession passion focus and an unbelievable work ethic sweat becomes the trend of the 1 success is available to anybody then is willing to work for it success can only be bought with the courtesy of odd work and champions refused to concede to anything less than leaving every ounce of themselves on the practice field to wait move the classroom whatever changes do they carry that same understanding of greatness with them they dont turn it on and off depending on where theyre at in this constant they never enter an environment without it to stand next to them is to be infected their commitment inspires strengthens and impacts everyone who comes in contact with them they are leaders music but my ashes they set the example for their teammates and exemplify the message blessed and unstoppable theyve adopted the same mindset of the ones who held up the championship trophies before them and they continue to carry the torch so that the standard is never forgotten pain defeats and magician are scared to come nearly superman who kaka lost with a vengeance they fight and stretch until every second once off the clock is that an option for them they never quit never concede and never give up champions become phenomenal by mastering the basics day in and day out they do a little base well they take nothing for granted they take no shortcuts they do it the right way all day every day but i dont do it at all the greats are so focused did they become a noon to all distractions and by disciplining their mind they stay ready for the opportunity and when that opportunity comes they seize it with hunker they see no competition pure hard work and drink sweat for replenishment only the strongest survive this is a battle of the fittest most people are too comfortable of being good itll be great easy is the breeding ground for complacency and champions notice therefore they smashed all traces of it from their life they set the door to anyone who sells average mercy when vision procreates with hard work dreams become a reality and to give up is to commit abortion on the light would come head winning requires understanding every aspect of your opponent and the best way to do that is to look in the mirror its you versus you cut out bad do you want it do you want to be a champion i mean can you really want to be a champion i mean a champion in all walks of life every area lets so climb your work ethic your execution speak for you six and is no there is no all season davos season is the season and this is the same not just in sports but in business in

disney shared that disney was dealt a tough hand by the pandemic but with chaybeck at the helm disneys businesses have not only weathered the storm but emerged in a position of strength and plans have been in the works since 2018 for a highspeed train that would run from the orlando airport to disney world but it appears that those plans are not going to come to fruition the full line connects southern florida to orlando the orlando international airport and a future line was intended to connect the airport directly to disney with a station at disney worlds shopping and dining district disney springs but disneys officially pulled the plug on bringing a highspeed rail station to disney springs it was decided in may that the bright line would share tracks that currently housed the

news the fuzzy tonton from ogas cantina has had a bit of a saga lately first it vanished from disneyland then the foam was going to change now the drink is missing altogether from disney worlds hollywood studios our team of reporters have been checking on that every single day we confirmed with several cast members and team leaders that the fuzzy taunton is currently gone and the cms we spoke to said they were not sure if itd be coming back but that it might this seems to be stemming from supply issues surrounding the buzz buttons or szechuan flowers that base the foam topping it may

P6h-Lx4cBVw,fight through it  motivational speech,Motivation,i dont care how good you arent tell how talented you are i dont care how much you work on yourself there are some times when things arent going to go right there are times when anything that can happen will happen life will knock you between the eyes it will catch you on the blind side come out of nowhere stuff you cant anticipate that will knock the wind out of you you want to give up what do you do when it seems like suffering wont stop what do you do when it feels like your pain doesnt have a point what do you do when your battle chooses you what do you do when something shows up on your doorstep that you did not directly cause choose or definitely anticipate there will be seasons where we will suffer there will be seasons of real pain and the question is how will you respond in those moments when you run out of money when things dont work out for you when things happen that you could not anticipate what are the reasons that you can think of that can keep you strong if you know the why for living you can endure almost anyhow maybe youve taken a knockdown concerning your finances lately maybe its with your kids maybe with your marriage maybe with your health maybe some other arena of life youre laying on the mat gasping and you dont know what youre gonna do it may be the number in your bank account that is screaming you are broke you can break physically you can break mentally you can break your heart you can break your spirit and all of those are gonna leave a mark but the mark that they leave can be the mark of victory or can be the mark of defeat the fight is just beginning you have the opportunity to show the world what you are really made of i need you to look at that sickness thats going on in your life right now whatever it is i want you to say i cant beat it i can beat it i will beat it i must i got a family live for i aint through yet my life aint over yet theres some things in life you dont need no degree for it you dont need no money for it theres something like you just gonna get through when you tell yourself im gonna get through this and im not retreating im not running i dont care what they say on paper i dont care if you say we outnumbered we live by this and we die by this we dont retreat if you would be willing to fight your way through this battle fight your way through cancer fight your way through that academic struggle fight your way through divorce fight your way through it if you are willing to fight your way through that singing career fight your way through boxing fight your way through football im telling you at the end of the fight is going to come victory i believe that this is your beginning but this doesnt have to be your end that just because you are currently here this is your present circumstances that life dont have to end for you right now you take those terrible events in your life and you create a new story of triumph we got to become something new we take those traumas we take that pain and we allow it to become a part of who we want to be hold on to that fundamental quality of faith have faith and on the other side of your pain is something good music you

I9rJ_efIx20,cool tech under 50 for your setup  december,Tech,looking for some more cool tech under 50 bucks for your setup well you came to the right place lets begin music still gaming in 720p on your grandmothers monitor dont you think its time for an upgrade the corsair xenion is the ultimate gaming monitor that packs a ton of features like an insane 32inch quad hd ips display and 165hz refresh rate with a one millisecond response time if youre a gamer and content creator youll also enjoy the stunning accurate panel with 100 srgb coverage it also offers a nice amount of adjustability points including height swivel and tilt with builtin cable management clips in the back we already know its techsource approved and with the builtin multimount in the back you have the flexibility of adding anything you want from lights to mics and even dslr cameras you know you want to learn more so click the link below alright so kicking off the episode is a really cool rgb bar that adds a bit of dynamic lighting to your setup its 125 inches in length and costs only 14 per bar so you can actually pick up a few of them for under 50 dollars if you have a multimonitor setup now these are designed to be mounted on the bottom of your monitor providing a nice underglow its actually very similar to the monitor light bar i featured in the last cool tech video except this one is rgb and its meant for underneath your monitor instead but that wont stop you from mounting it anywhere you want because of the corner design this allows you to tilt the lights at a 45 degree angle now the lights arent perfectly diffused as you can see each individual diode but it is diffused enough to where you can have them facing you like a regular light bar you can also put these behind your monitors and have it bounce off the wall for a nice back glow its really up to you on how you want to use these and lets say you just want to light up the desk so you can see your peripherals a lot better well you can do that too because theres a dedicated controller right on the cable itself letting you control the lights but i do recommend using the provider remote instead for convenience you can choose from a bunch of cool effects and color schemes as well as control the brightness and speed of the effects all on the remote itself one thing i dont really like about the light bar is the location of the cable because it comes out from the side it makes it a bit more difficult to hide so you have to be smart on the placement of these so you can hide the cables if they had the cable come out from the back it would have looked so much cleaner in my opinion now the good thing is that this is usb powered so you dont need an extra outlet you can just plug it directly into the back of your pc or any usb power source this isnt just limited to your setup by the way you can get creative and really use it anywhere you want to add some really nice dynamic lighting up next is a really nice budgetfriendly capture card for anyone looking to stream games or capture 4k video from another source a lot of other 4k capture cards are pretty pricey like the elgato 4k60 which costs 250 bucks well this one pretty much does the same thing for a fraction of the price the way it works is very simple you plug in any device you want to capture using the hdmi input this can be a camera laptop phone gaming console or even a pc then use an hdmi cable and plug in a display into the hdmi out this can be any type of display from a monitor to a tv or other displays with an hdmi port the capture card even has dedicated audio jacks for consoles so if you want to record audio from your headphones and microphone then you need to plug them in here after everything is set up you just have to download obs and add a video capturing source and youre pretty much done you can now start capturing content up to 4k resolution and 60 hertz heres a gameplay sample of forza horizon 5 that i was able to record directly off of the capture card so in terms of recording quality that really depends on the specs of your system the higher the specs the higher the bit rate you can set in obs and the higher you can set the resolution as well one thing i do recommend is using a secondary monitor to view and manage obs while you are gaming on the main monitor it just makes it really easy to start and stop recording while making sure your gameplay is being recorded since you can glance over and double check whenever you want the capture card also works with current gen consoles like the xbox series x and the playstation 5 but do keep in mind that you wont be able to take advantage of the 120 hertz refresh rate since it caps the refresh rate at 60 all in all this is a fantastic capture card for the money especially if you dont want to spend a couple hundred dollars on the elgato 4k60 these next two items will help add a bit of functionality to your setup first up we got the kiwi mount bracket this is an awesome way to add a mounting point to some of your devices like a webcam dslr or anything that has a quarter inch screw so it can be used with security cameras and vr sensors as well this is especially useful if youre a streamer and you want to have your camera a bit further away from you so it can capture more of your setup or background ive also seen a lot of people mount their lighting gear on here which is useful if you just dont have the extra space on your desk the mounting bracket itself has a ball head giving you a full 360 degree adjustability and it comes with a shield to cover the mounting screws after youre done using it you can also mount this directly to your wall using the 3m vhb tape on the back these cost only 10 a pop and they come in either white or black i just love how much functionality these can add to your setup if you know how to use it correctly im sure you guys have seen a bunch of magnetic cable clips out there but this one from anker is my personal favorite because it can adapt to more cable sizes the actual cable clip itself doesnt lock meaning if the cable you are using is slightly thicker than 35 millimeters then it can still work because the clip can expand slightly this is such a fantastic way to organize all the cables in your setup or workspace and have easy access to them when you need since theyre magnetic you can easily peel them off and snap it back when youre done using it now if you have a lot of thicker cables then i would recommend going with the velcro option instead because you do have more flexibility on adjusting the size to compensate for bigger cables to my knowledge anker only makes these in blue for some reason you know i would have loved to see black or maybe even white but you do get two for the price of eighteen dollars ive seen my fair share of budget sixty percent mechanical keyboards under fifty dollars in fact most of them are either cheaply made or they are carbon copies of one another from china well not this one i was pleasantly surprised when i came across the tazari tk61 this here is a sixty percent mechanical keyboard using gatorade optical switches i wont spend too much time going over differences but optical switches are slightly different as they use light detection so the actuation is much faster than regular mechanical switches and older keyboards are also hot swappable but the downside is that you are pretty much limited on the selection of switches out there compared to regular mechanical switches and thats because the pin layout is different you can only stick to optical switches in this keyboard and yes this is hot swappable you get a keycap and a switch puller inside the box along with a right angle usb cable which is awesome for clean cable routing construction of the keyboard is really nice you know despite the shell and top plate being made out of plastic the build is very similar to the rk61 which is another very well made budget 60 keyboard i covered on the channel however i gotta say i do like the pudding keycaps on this one they are double shot pbt and if youre an rgb fanatic you will love how these look most of the other keyboards in this price range dont come with dedicated software while others have a poorly designed software which is why i was pleasantly surprised with the tk61 not only was the ui extremely easy to navigate but you have way more options to customize the lighting on your keyboard so many awesome effects to choose from on the left side but whats really cool is that you can choose the direction for the effect as well for example if i go with the wave effect i can select how i want the lighting to show up on the keyboard by clicking on the arrows i can even have the light start from the center and go outwards or vice versa that is something i dont see in other budget 60 keyboards in this price so applause if you have 50 bucks to spend on a 60 mechanical keyboard and you love rgb you got to check this out its awesome if you dont like the color white they do offer it in black as well wrapping up the episode is a really cool bedside lamp that offers wireless charging support its a very simple device really it offers three levels of brightness and a flatbed where you can charge your smartphone or other devices wirelessly there is a little led indicator that will let you know if its charging or not if the red light is blinking that means its not able to charge your device due to some interference or the device is placed incorrectly if the red light is static then it means the phone is charging successfully so the way you adjust the brightness is by simply tapping or touching any part of the frame and i just love how sensitive it is it always works the first time i also really like the design of the lamp its very minimal with a touch of modern so its going to fit nicely in a lot of homes if you have been looking to pick up a nice bedside lamp that also offers charging for your qi enabled devices then this is something i strongly recommend picking up if the square model doesnt exactly fit with the theme of your home then you can check out any of their other three designs that they offer two of which actually have builtin clocks and i pretty much wraps up this much cool tech video as always ill drop a link to everything i talked about down below but if you guys are still looking for cool tech for the upcoming holidays consider watching my previous cool tech videos that ive done for all of 2021 chances are youll find something really cool to pick up but yeah thank you guys so much for watching as always i love you beautiful faces and ill see you very soon in the next one

wdG7OIEMvXo,yankees vs red sox game highlights 71022  mlb highlights,Game,recently had adam wainwright on a sunday night nick cavett is another one of those guys who has as coney would say a dynamite curveball he really does and you look at the krate and the base on ball raid right around league average but his secret sauce is that riding carrying four seam fastball up in the zone in that near smeared spin curveball right off of that four seamer really steep break to it dropping right off the table strike three after falling behind twoandoh three straight strikes and le mayhew goes down looking here is stanton hes six for 16 with two homers against pavetta challenged him right center field that one is lasered out to right and its over the wall giancarlo stand the line shot at 114 off the bat and it leaves and the yankees add to their total of homers and lead it 20 giancarlo beginning of the season first two months he was outstanding whats going on hes kind of a little bit of a regression to the mean hes giving up some long balls that was a really low rate his home run to fly ball rate hes a strike thrower just a three percent walk rate and a roller hes flying mamehi knows it but he throws them out theyre a two down for jd martinez and jd popped it up playable for the allstar reserve catcher trevino ten pitches tie on through it maybe a little bruised the ball that hit him in the backside was 102 miles an hour ouch and the yankees have first and second and no one out heres jose trevino trevito that is going to get down in left field touching third carpenter hes coming in hicks will stop at third to second trevino dives in powered at second base an rbi and a threenothing lead bogarts is already pointing at second he understands who the hitter was does not hesitate at all and throws a strike over to trevor story well heres kind of falafel with the runner at third one out the infield is up for boston back up the middle and through rvi single for kinder philippa and the yankees are ruining pivedas night they lead it 40 in the top of the second inning frozen 76 up in the zone 78 mile an hour curveball barks into his glove because he gives up two and four heres xander bogarts now here comes the 22 and the cod adamus struck him out swinging one away heres francie now vote for his last six heres the one pitch coming to cordero and he swings and drives one deep to center field back for the wall it goes and its into the bleachers two run homer frankie cordero and the red sox have cut the yankee lead in half he went down got a low pitch and crushed it to dead center field over the bleacher bar bradley center field hicks nice running catch and that will retire the side bradley off his fists that guy off the barrel its a double for rizzo giancarlo stanton the battery and the pitch line to short and caught by bogarts it knocked him down that might have caught him that was another absolute smash hit by stanton xander was on the edge of the outfield grass and hes back on his feet that was a hundred and ten and a half miles per hour a hanging breaking ball and xander did well to catch it carpenter walked and scored his first time rizzo an inning opening double hes still there carpenter hammers this one to right bradley goes back he looks up hes at the wall its over the wall matt carpenter continues to terrorize the baseball and pavetta they add two more and its six two yankees three strike three pivetta who barked into his glove last half would likely do the same again he has given up two in each of the first three innings well there are two way and that will bring up vasquez swinging a wellhit ball toward left heading toward the monster seats and that ones gone off the light tower left field christian vasquez its the red sox second home run of the game the solo shot and the yankee lead is now 63 right tower power jd gone and every time a pitcher seemingly has left them out at fenway tonight they have been barking into their glow so first and second with one man out picks on the ground cordero for one back to first ort got his foot on the bag thats a big double play for the rookie reliever its important to get this run home i mean you gotta chip away yankee lead theyve had all night vasquez ground that i won three and homer off the light tower vasquez this one deep stanton going back theres the monster it is off the wall vasquez to second oh he does not slide but he gets his toe in there for a double he brings in bradley at six four he just barely beat the tag by dj lemayo so the tying run comes to the plate in the person of jd martinez who was fouled out to the catcher and struck out a chance to cut into the lead even more and he swings and drives one to right center field deep back goes judge to the bullpen wall gone tie game can you believe it jd martinez hitting his shot into the bullpen out where the catcher stands and the red sox pen and the red sox have tied it at six this is a really important uh atbat for hell come up with the bases loaded and nobody out the 22 pitch he struck him out another pitch down and in out of the strike zone he should have walked yep he swung it he had the two balls in the count and he struck at the swung at two more balls so heres jeter downs one for five is a big leaguer shallow center field lemay whos got his hand up again oh he missed another one theres a force out at second the run will come in and the red sox grab a lead was aaron hicks close enough to call him off it twice this inning may who has gone out to the outfield once he called off judge here he calls off aaron hicks and here is christian vasquez first and third two out and vasquez wild swing and a miss chapman will leave the mound giving up just one now you be the judge at home dj le mayhew called both of these balls one in right field one in center field and then the second one with aaron hicks on an even more difficult play for le mayhew so two down and thatll bring up stanton strike three called another one off the plate and stan fires his back down on the ground the pads follow he is upset at those called strikes and so is aaron boone this was it for moon he kept holding up six and then complaining that you missed the down and then you missed the up that was the ejection and then he came out and got his moneys worth with both tripp gibson and jerry lane so the bases are loaded and trevor story will hit next story drives one to left thats deep stanton looks up hicks looks up and it goes high off the wall jd martinez is coming in hes followed by bogarts whos followed by bardugo a threerun double for story and the red sox now lead at 106 franchi cordero greats the righthander albert abreu of brayus first pitch theres a punt and its a good one fielded bad throw coming around third and scoring is story and the red sox are doing to the yankees what the yankees have been doing to many other teams he was on it the entire time he played this right usually lefthanded hitters get on the inside part but he stayed outside and ran perfectly down the line connor falefa who is singled and twice lined to right roller here downs charges bare hands oh what a play jeter downs bare hands it to get isaiah kiner falefa on a difficult play and a pretty quick runner on this yankee team as good as it gets downs high hopper story to first double play game over red sox win at 116 for the second night in a row cheater downs contributes defensively against the yankees

uFgqVRC_Xzs,latte art mistakes this is why your latte art fails,Art,stop it right now youre not here to see beautiful latte art youre here because your latte art looks more like this stick around im going to show you whats going wrong and how you can fix it hi im paul from the coffee science and education centre in these videos we do equipment reviews do basic barista skills and we also cover the science that brings it all together so if youre interested and you want to stay in the loop hit the subscribe button right now in my day to day i train baristas every single week and i see these six same mistakes that baristas make every single time theyre trying with latte art all right mistake number one baristas dont get the texture right if your texture is bubbly or too thin or too thick you never going to pour great latte art my basic tip to all start out baristas is that it looks like melted ice cream so keep on practicing until you get that really nice silky texture also full cream milk is the best way to start all right mistake number two is we dont set up the canvas right the first thing i tell baristas to do is give the crema a nice swirl it mixes it all together and makes it easy to pour into it also maintains a really nice balanced flavor at the end when youre actually giving it to the customer mistake number three is baristas wait too long before they start pouring coffee can smell your fear get in as soon as possible i usually say that the halfway point in the cup is where you want to start pouring latte art now mistake number four is one of the ones that baristas have a lot of trouble with and thats either pouring too fast or too slow now i could tell you about it or i could show you pour too fast and the crema will just disappear and what youll end up with is a lot of white in your cup pour too slow and youre just going to have the crema rise all the way to the top and youre going to have no patterns at all this takes time and practice so the more you vary your speed as youre pouring the more youll learn the best way to pour latte art now number five is keeping your angles simple so often i see baristas with all these wacky angles and trying too hard to pour latte art if you line your cup up nice and straight with your jug and pour nice and straight youll get good symmetrical latte art and this will take a little bit of practice and a little bit of adjusting your cup and the angles of your arms but eventually if you can draw a straight line with your jug from the top to the bottom of the cup youre going to get really nice latte now mistake number six is you pull through too fast youve done all of this hard work drawn this great symmetrical pattern with all of these nice leaves and youre in this hurry to finish it off stop right there slow it right down at the very end lift your jug up a little bit higher have it toothpick thin so that when you drag it through it draws a nice even line down the middle and creates that really nice latte art all right thats my six mistakes a lot of baristas make in trying to do latte art but heres my bonus tip if you want to practice heaps but minimize your milk wastage you can do this now after finishing your first cup pour the cup back into your jug swirl it together to recombine it poor a small amount into the cup and cover it with chocolate now go ahead and practice your latte art at the end of that cup pull that cup back into the jug swirl it again to recombine it pour a small amount into the cup and cover it with chocolate again and practice your latte art again now you can do this five to six times without it affecting the milk texture too much give it a try and youll find that your milk wastage will be less and less all right thats it for now tell me below in the comments what your biggest latte art failure is for now see you later

sl61lHwo3YE,the 1000000 unboxing,Tech, is this just like a  oh yeah yeah yeah stop stop stop stop stop stop  but where are they hardware clattering really by an order of magnitude this boxes thudding will be the single most expensive unboxing weve ever done inside these boxes this crate this server rack this additional box and this final box over here this monster server from supermicro is everything that we need to deploy a server with a petabyte of ssds kioxia provided the ssds they sponsored this video it has been a year in the making and we are about to see performance to likes of which we have never seen and may well never see again realistically like  jake yeah  in our lifetime  jake theyre not even just ssds theyre nvme ssds  lets bring back beep thats a series we havent done in a while beep  beep  linus beep bright music  i think that servers worth like 100000 so  100000 server you say  something like that  well lets move it gently then theres gonna be a whole follow up video detailing the exact architect yeah  follow up videos  theres gonna be multiple videos detailing the setup and architecture of a petabyte of flash because while kioxia does make such high capacity nvdme ssds now that you could pretty easily build a server with a petabyte of flash accessible to it but in order to get the full performance out of it jake laughing both laughing oh my goodness  oh my god  you gotta do something a little special  i dont think im gonna let you pick this one up  you know you gotta give nvidia credit jake chuckling  it looks pretty special  does their hardware have sex appeal or does it have sex appeal  i think this is just the module this actually slots into the main server  so what are we looking at here  so each of these is an nvidia a100 80 gig so weve got eight of them nvidia linked together thats  640 gigabytes of vram  yep  video memory jake chuckling these cards alone are probably worth more than any other individual server we own  i think this thing this unit is almost 100000 just this part of it  and what are these are these just like some kind of  jake i think thats just power delivery  i expect  they asked us not to take them off but  oh really  we already have have it so like we can just do it anyways  i mean nvidia cant hate us anymore can they  they will  no they probably can you know what lets not piss off the enterprise guys because  this looks like power delivery  can i just say that its all sponsored by kioxia who provided the flash but nvidia has been absolute bros and broettes about this whole thing cause we wouldnt have been able to do it without them so i guess yeah lets pick it up  why dont we move this off of the server so we at least have somewhere to put this  well im gonna know whats under it oh wait thats it  the server ah yes  oh thats why the box was so big  yeah oh look at those rails  i know right these are chunktastic  lets just yeah lets just lift this out of the put it on top of that sure  sure  thats safe  so how did this even come to be now ive been babysitting this for  a year  a year but ideally wasnt there for the first conversation  what happened was kioxia has worked with us a number of times and they were looking for some kind of cool ssdrelated video to do  cool you say  i took an absolute long shot cause this was after wed already seen the appetite for a petabyte project on the channel but theyre a flash vendor and i was like well it would have to be ssds and it would have to be and i thought they were gonna come back with something way smaller dont tell kioxia but they wouldve gotten away with like a quarter of this jake laughing but i was like well its gonna it cant be smaller than what weve done before and they were like oh this is actually a very interesting engineering challenge from our standpoint lets see who we can partner with to try and make this happen  and the answer was supermicro amd weka fricking everyone you could possibly name in the server space  so how does this fricking work okay lets lift this boy up were gonna start at the back which is a little unusual this is our head unit jake laughing both laughing this is pcie over fiber because the ssds dont actually go in the control unit this is where all the compute lives in order to do this kind of throughput you need a very very exotic very powerful solution the ssds themselves jake laughing  this is the size of an atx power supply  are gonna live in additional units that were gonna unbox in a few minutes here  holy just  how many watts are these  beep this is a 3000 watt power supply  can we even power this  ive never actually seen one of these plugs properly used jake laughing  im just curious what is in here oh  oh god  oh wait what is this just like a  oh yeah yeah yeah thisll be like a stop stop stop stop stop stop  so you gotta unscrew it then  no sorry i meant this part  oh yeah okay now youre right  stop though you gotta take this side out  well i thought you were gonna oh  i dont have a screwdriver  what are you doing what are you doing over here youre just  waiting for you to hand me the screwdriver  well hooey  hooey  okay jake laughing  oh my god what even is that  so heres what were looking at weve got our pcie over fiber cards here  these are just nvidia connectx6 200 gig cards  wow  theres eight of them  and then weve got more pcie so you can see weve got linus groaning there you go right there okay we got a little bit more pcie to these nvme base at the back here so you got four more of those and then youve got a little bit more pcie okay up here and thats going to this which is probably like a dual 10 gig card or something like that thats just for  it might just be gigabit like for management you know what i know you like that much pcie i gotta tell you this one theres more pcie jake laughing  oh are you serious so this unit can take a total of 10 nvme drives and then it has another eight pcie 16x slots then there were those nvme connectors i didnt recognize to the sleds at the back  and then theres all the a100s  oh my goodness so do we slide it in  jake i think we should put it in the rack first  they have to be epycs of some sort  jake oh they are dual 64 part  okay  where are they oh theyre in the top theyre in like the very top  yeah  so theres the pcie lanes for the a100s that just sit under it very cool  i dont know how to take this out cause kinda  i wonder if it got hit a little actually in shipping  looks a little worn yeah  looks a little bored  oh boy  oh boy  oh theres a screw right here  oh theres your problem jake laughing  you got this dont drop it  i got it i got it dual 64 core epycs i have to assume that that slakes  that means 713 is this two terabytes of samsung memory  the spec sheet said 256 but i dont actually know who sent it okay here lets just pop one out  oh boy  theyre not gonna like this thats a 64 gig dimm dual rank 3200 megahertz samsung well its supermicro memory so  yeah  this is a qualified  so 64 gigs that would make this yeah  32 2 terabytes  2 terabytes of ram  ah look at those these things must scream  fricking real  linus yeah these fans  what are those 40 mills  gotta be absolutely ridiculous  jake this is a lot of hardware in one box  on fricking real love the air flow management here gotta put basically all of it through the cpus  the rams i could have a little bit  the rams are slightly yeah come on maybe theres a little bit of cooling  look its like a tiny little spot there  yeah  these vrm heatsinks are like i dont need much both laughing  theres business level hardware hardware clattering and then theres enterprise level hardware this thing is unbelievably heavy there is a lot of fricking cooling in it its like a solid ass block of aluminum  okay its very heavy yes i understand lets put it in the goddamn thing huh  how many watts  oh look at that they got flappers what the hell  holy crap the fan itself is this thick  yeah wait now is there two in there  crazy  may be two in there  so theres two blades see this  yeah theres two blades  so youve got this blade is swept this way  they spin independently  and then this one is swept this way because if you want more static pressure you cant put two fans that spin the same way theres some kind of aerodynamics thing that makes it so that doesnt work very well they have to be spinning counter to each other we didnt really consider that when we assembled this up here we were going to have to bring it down  yeah  okay plan  where are we gonna put it  were gonna put it on top of the rack for now  ill take the light side  i see we ready  oh my god  okay if we drop this like its game over  no no were good heres what were gonna do this thing already got beat up to hell in shipping so were gonna bring it down like this go ahead and put it on yeah  here you go little guy  oh  i dunno if little guy is the right word for it  absolute unit guy this is when you have all the budget cause its not just powerful its dense you gotta remember in the data center density has a ton of value because building a data center is the most expensive thing about building a data center  so each of these one use servers are gonna be our storage hosts theres six of them  six  six we gotta put 72 drives in here  now you might think hey guys this is austin recorder beeping you might think hey guys why didnt you just pick servers that could take more nvme ssds well heres the thing once youve got high performance enough ssds and these are all kioxia cd6 pcie gen4x4 nvme drives you run out of cpu power as well as pcie for networking as well so you cant just put as many drives as you want in each server you gotta add more compute you gotta add more networking  yeah this dual processor so these are linus groaning oh gosh  32 cores each and a far more reasonable im guessing this is 512 gigs of ram  jake it says 256 but i think this is wrong  yeah only 256 and then of course weve got the nvidia connectx6 200 gigabit network cards that are gonna handle our nvme over i guess actually theyre not fiber are they cause theyre so close  i think were gonna be using direct detect but you call it nvme over fiber  its nvme over fiber just with fiber you can go farther  is that the boot ssd or what  oh its adorable  oh my god it just slots right into the  its a little see there thumb drive come on out  jake i think theres probably a lock on it  oh yeah there is look at that thats so cool  these are super cute  yeah oh look they even included a usb typeb port so you could run and rate on this thing  yeah so the reason that people use these instead of an internal usb drive is just that the grade of nonflash that gets used for a device like this tends to be higher and while honestly in a real enterprise deployment a boot drive failing is probably not the end of the world  jake a lot of the time theyre booted over fiber too  yeah its just why right just use something better now you might be wondering why we went amd epyc which means you probably havent been paying close attention over the last few years but basically these will boost up to 37 gigahertz giving us tons of compute 64 total cores and they have lightning fast not to mention a ton of pcie connectivity so every device in pretty much this whole rack i think is gonna be running at  jake full speed  maximum speed  jake definitely will  we dont want any bottlenecks we cant have bottlenecks before we move on to a couple of more fun things i noticed about this these are 20 watt fans each of them both laughing 80 watts thats 150 watts in fans  wait are these is that just oh yeah theyre like the same type  yeah epyc has so much pcie that you can just put a pcie 16x slot just chilling in the middle of your server both giggling just hanging there yes this is a 200 gigabit card one of two each of these is gonna have a 400 gigabit per second connection to our head unit jake giggling  the best part theres that slot theres another one back here  oh wow well that ones at least accessible from the outside  yeah yeah yeah  this is just hanging  theyre like man you wanna put some nvme in there  you only live once man now for the next part you guys saw this crate we were using as a table linus groaning  oh its very sharp  what the heck is all this  wait hold on go down  what  i think there might be more servers in here  kioxia oh these must be the drives oh whats this from mella oh excuse me excuse me the box says mellanox but i mean to say nvidia nvidia acquired mellanox somewhere in between this box being printed and us doing this project linus chuckling  what could be in this box hmm oh  wait what whoa what  we originally asked micron to send memory for this project but supermicro was like oh its not qualified yet jake babbling  wait what  i think these are just eight gig dimms  eight gig 3200  can i take some of this home is it all eight gig  i dont know  well thanks micron whats behind this door  in fairness though there are some really cool cables in here theres power cables those arent the cool ones and then theres these guys these will do 200 gigabit per second and these are the direct attached copper cables that were gonna be running between our head unit and our ssd units now theres networking gear thats like pretty cool and then theres this this is a mellanox well nvidia 3700 series  oh beep  200 gigabit switch thats right each of these ports 200 gigabit per second  and it can do it all at full speed at the same time  this thing is bananas  bystander sorry what  they will all do 200 gigabit per second  its always fun when you start measuring your network switches in terabits  yeah the fans are 30 what 31 fans  i wanna see how big are the power supply jake giggling hardware clattering  really  i just looked at the spec sheet of that switch 128 terabit  ah oh they are oh thats hilarious we were look kioxia are you guys new to working with like  jake no it matters the position matters  oh the position matters  jake yeah dont switch em around  oh i was gonna be all like kioxia come on whats the fun of unboxing all the ssds if you dont put them in a box but okay the position actually matters a lot for this configuration so well just take a look at this drive and carefully put it back in here each of these is 1536 terabytes and can deliver a total throughput of six gigabytes per second which is impressive considering that were gonna have 12 of them per server so thats 72 gigabytes a second per server absolutely mindboggling numbers but theres even better stuff so its obviously using a completely custom solution everything from the controller to the flash is all kioxia through and through and this puppy can do a million iops per drive so by the time were done with this we are going to be putting everything we have ever done before to absolute shame if you dont watch our channel regularly you might not have heard of kioxia but weve actually worked with them a fair bit they were the first to deliver a u3 capable drive the first to deliver pcie gen40 drives they are formerly toshibas flash division so theyve got literally decades of experience working with this kind of technology and im really excited to see what these drives can do at their absolute peak of course speeds not the entire story and im obligated to tell you that they are of course using the same high quality flash that they use in their highend enterprise sas and other nvme products with the same reliability features and of course also theyve got support for everything from nonencrypted drives to sanitized instant erase selfencrypting drive scd fips to level 2 certified if you need it and its an ssd kioxia has something for you  jake or something better than you were thinking  or something better the final piece of the puzzle is our server rack sort of server rack clattering lets talk about how were powering this server rack clattering oh my goodness what the heck is going on here is this the most whack power cord you guys have ever seen here it is next to a human hand for scale okay  well i mean i dont know about human theres a normal hand  fricking ridiculous  these are l630s so thats 240 volt 30 amp each of em we didnt actually have a place to plug these in  ah yeah  were gonna be stealing i think one of the plugs from the welder and then one of the plugs from the mill i got infinite cables to make these giant extension cords theyre like just as thick maybe thicker so yeah we cant use the welder or the router when we run this rack but i think thatll be okay infinite cables also provided a hundred meter 100 gig cable so we can plug it into the switch back there  no  i guess well have to like run it outside but yeah  guys this is gonna be a really fun series were gonna go through the hardware the software linus giggling  were gonna show you ai benchmarks  yeah its gonna be great 4 times 12  384  300 okay plus another 128  plus another 128 so 512 cores jake laughing thats the same amount of ram we have in our main editing server  were gonna have 512 cores and a terabyte of flash  its a little bit more than that  this is gonna be  a terabyte of flash  petabyte sorry my brain broke  like 11 petabytes yeah  thats not possible  yeah  petabyte of flash  128  petabyte of flash thats crazy no one would be crazy enough final shout out to everyone who helped  kioxia nvidia slash mellanox whatever you decide you wanna be amd  micron  supermicro fscom infinite cables  infinite cables  whoever  and jake tivy jake tivy whos been cool and all of our contacts at those places  im taking all this home afterwards  you guys have been so patient this has been  its gonna be a trade show at my house  if you guys are enjoying this series maybe go check out the original petabyte project series thats pretty cool too  i actually dont think the panel in my house has enough capacity to run this  i dont think mine does either jake wheezing

watching the borders all right i guess we are not filming the podcast today so we need some ice cream going into the fridge oh this is new lets try this chocolate chip cookie dough this is good oh

have vegan ice cream but i do have this weird am desserts that i made the other day which is basically you crush up a bunch of rice cakes and they just do peanut butter agave and cacao powder and then you put in the fridge and its like a greasy pieces kind of mmm so yummy actually music right now i would normally just lay down and like go on my phone probably and scroll through gosh theyre really yelling for the game probably like go on instagram i spend way too much time on instagram but i cant find my phone so i think maybe i will take this opportunity to pack for this mystery trip oh here it is whatever ill still pack though okay heres my luggage case kellys parents were kind enough to send me my own luggage tag kelly has one of these and i always think its like the cutest thing and now i have my own and it literally says extra dynamic and its sage green my favorite color and im so excited to finally put it on my suitcase yes im gonna travel like a wakasa packing time okay so i am going to bring a few bikinis we got this one from princess polly both of these are from aurel look like this and this then i also have a bunch of stuff from free people first off this beautiful

skirts athletic shirts denim shorts sneakers super cute tank top from princess polly another shrug not really it am i missing anything oh sandals tons of different tank tops and one pair of jeans oh god applause and now i am all ready to go okay now it is officially time for my real night routine like makeup removal and skincare routine im gonna show you guys everything that i do so first off im gonna take off all my jewelry from my fingers are like getting swollen at the end of the day because i think i ate a lot of salt i literally throw all my jewelry over here on the shelf princess polly ian charms so im gonna really like pull back my hair im gonna use this actually kelly uses this like every night okay ears first thing first floss i got this listerine blossom kind of interesting this is removable makes it so easy to floss my brother andrew put me onto this next up brush my teeth with a beautiful soft bristle toothbrush that was kindly gifted to me by kellys dad mike wakasa dds very nice toothbrush my favorite toothbrush what brand is this nimbus ive never heard of that but its a nice toothbrush use some burts bees pure oh its all on my hand now its time for my skincare so i double cleanse my face i only recently started doing this actually because i finally got gifted an oil cleanser as pr and i actually really like it this one is from peach and lily it is their ginger melt oil cleanser so i use this first feels really weird to use the oil cleanser honestly because i just feel like im rubbing oil on my face but really helps get off your makeup music this is a random like canadian cleanser that i heard was really good for getting rid of parallel dermatitis i like have a very interesting skincare routine i feel like because i was trying so hard to get rid of my rash ive been using this i actually feel like it keeps my skin like in very good condition but its like really expensive and i can only buy it in like a three pack on amazon for like 50 bucks i was like what the heck this is just like a regular soapy cleanser so i use it as my second cleanser so in the summer i try to go for like an oil free moisturizer so this one is the peach slices salicylic acid or free moisturizer so i will in fact be using a little bit of this i have a pimple right here that ive been trying to get rid of for ages and then i like to follow up with a little pecuchio oil its like a retinol alternative i also put on deodorant before i go to bed because people say like you swell in your sleep and then it makes you smell bad so fun a little bit of deodorant sometimes i spray a little perfume on at night because i smell good my everyday everyday perfume gucci gorgeous gardenia the pink bottle kind of gives me abercrombie vibes i love abercrombie perfume now i can take out my little bunny ears and its time for me to pack another bag because i am going to go to orange theory tomorrow so i always pack my bag beforehand because i feel like i always say the key to success is make hard tasks easier on yourself if possible that was a very poor way to say that i feel but basically like it can be hard to get yourself up to go to the gym especially i try to get myself up to go to orange theory very early in the morning and what makes it easier for me is if i pack my bag beforehand have my full outfit ready my gym outfit just so i can get out of the door faster and so that i basically am like confirming with myself like yes ashley you packed up all your stuff you are gonna go to the gym tomorrow so heres my book bag oh hey what are you doing in here why are you holding that huge tripod man hey hey hey can i film with you in a sec are you gonna film with me in here yeah man weve been in this closet like a million times today i feel like im gonna choose my gym outfit or tomorrow i like to wear little cutesy matching gym outfits because it makes my gym experience more enjoyable i think i will wear this set it is from set active love this color mojito so basically my clothes picked out for the next day i just like leave it on my chair for now okay im ready for you really setting up shop man probably wear this sweatshirt over it hey i was putting my clothes right there dont fart i feel like youre gonna fart dont do it im sick and tired of your farts in my videos theres been too many then i also think tomorrow im gonna wear my waterproof sneakers these are from vessi i will place these by the chair as well excuse me um excuse me yes come in laughter kelly city has to film something with me right now wait kelly i like just took off all my makeup and stuff you look great but i put on like my facial oil because i look greasy im supposed to relax im scared im scared going i put a laptop and an ipad apart from us bro are you kidding me this is the furthest you are from your room feel different like east coast west coast yeah the air is different here literally and i also have to choose my outfit that i put on after the gym so this is usually the hardest part that takes me the longest i have to actually do like a business meeting right after orange theory im gonna do a black athletic skirt and a black tank top now im packing in my outfit also need to make sure that you include bra undies extra pair of socks ill just throw it right in the bag i also pack my jewelry and everything too so its quite a lot of stuff to remember last thing wallet keys and my washer bottle your weapon oh my god my weapon bro literally when i carry this around new york city this is when i feel the safest is because i know if i was had to slap someone with this they will not recover all ready to go oops okay apparently even though it is currently 12 49 am mr kelly needs to film with me is that what im hearing sir yes im waiting okay im ready you like my outfit thank you i just think that this is funny that this is how my life goes hey dont what are you doing hey im ready filming for kellys channel guys im doing my

Np8K4yUou4s,141 vs 83 buffet in bangkok thailand which one is worth it,Food,in this video youre going to see the cheapest and most expensive buffets here in bangkok thailand the two buffets were going to go to are very different the first one cos you wont believe this one dollar and 41 cents the second cost almost 60 times that amount over 80 dollars theres gonna be a huge difference in quality types of ingredients the types of foods and the amount of selection in each buffet first thing were gonna do is go to the cheap buffet and see what they got lets move right here is auntie roy buffet this is the most inexpensive buffet ive seen anywhere and so i was wondering how they do it music before i saw the food i thought they must have no meat it must all be just tofu and plants but no they have over a dozen dishes here a lot of different food but a lot of meat too it is 10 27 right now this place is getting busy behind me very quickly mostly youre gonna see a lot of drivers coming here people who drive taxis people who ride for grabs its an easy place to pull off the road grab a big plate of food people are not shy about the amount of food theyre grabbing it actually used to cost only 35 baht now its 55 which is still ridiculously cheap so right here you can grab your own plate spoon fork and they have a couple of rice options off the ban a white rice and then this looks tremendous theyve got a delicious looking veggie fried rice im gonna take a decent sized scoop shes adding some chilies right now to the fish sauce that looks very spicy right here is the main section they have 12 different trays full of different food options this looks like a minced stirfried fish with tons and tons of seasonings i would tell you the local name but im just going to say it wrong anyways here we have some bamboo shoots oh my gosh theres chilis on everything its not just bamboo shoots it looks like they have some small muscles unlike me i have big muscles thats what my wife tells me here we have liver and intestines with green beans these are all from the chicken oh is that an eyeball very nice the last thing i want to show you she is frying something here dumping it into this sieve so people are eating it its running out right here they cook more and this goes on until 3 pm we have our food we have round one lets go find a table boom round one right here i am looking forward to this fried rice because it looks fantastic oh super delicious they put very thin strips of the kaffir lime leaf in there so it has a little bit of that fresh limey citrusy flavor oh how about this when i saw this fish i thought it was pork mmhmm oh my oh oh im in march city doing marsh moves oh its very nice theres turmeric and a lot of chilies its super spicy im regretting right now that i dont have anything to drink oh i gotta drink some of this soup thailand so brutal i tried to cool down the spice with more spice this is almost like a greasy broth you can see the eye still im gonna peel the skin right off of the head i didnt know what to expect but this is a very nice soup also very sour like many soups in thailand very delicious all the flavors of everything ive had very different from each other unlike going to taco bell taco bell same flavor different shapes and textures thank you i got a new plate but youre not supposed to do that they just use the same plate here this is a bean sprout salad with some mushrooms carrots cut up beans oh a little bit of that this is what im really looking forward to right here these are glass noodles looks like theyre stir fried with tons of veggies inside they look super delicious here they have some deep fried fish this is what we saw being fried up earlier i can even feel it from the spoon how crispy it is and it looks like some basil fried up too and right here this is a curry with pumpkin and chicken that looks awesome that should probably go with rice but instead im just gonna get it all over my other food round two and already after this i will tried over half of the foods here first off we have the bean sprout salad i like it very simple wet and earthy like bean sprouts but a very welcome crunch and even more welcome fiber this is those fried fish so they look like little mini sardines little bait fish this is usually what i would use for fishing but it doesnt mean you cant fry it up and have it be delicious it tastes like a french fry but way more calcium and protein these are so addictive and then this oh my gosh fried basil why is this not a thing the more places around the world its one of my favorite things in thailand the flavor pops the leaf dissolves in your mouth very good next food right here we have the pumpkin and chicken pumpkins looking very nice and pumpkiny huh grab some chicken chewing cautiously in case of bones because we are in southeast asia you never know when they just hacked up a bird with a friggin axe that piece was mostly bone free this is delicious sweet coconut curry starchy pumpkins and nice big chunks of chicken this is what a buffet looks like for one dollar and 41 cents here in bangkok its really an incredible value the food is fresh its interesting its creative its diverse and you still get some protein its not some uh you know its one dollar but its vegan food its a head of lettuce im very impressed but we are not finished were heading to another buffet a buffet that is about 60 times more expensive but are they gonna have 60 times the option 60 times the fun the flavor next we are headed to the marriott one buffet down one to go right behind me the marriott but not just any marriott this is the marriott marquis in bangkok is it marquise or marquis is that french spanish whats marquee this marriott has one of the most expensive buffets youre going to find anywhere in thailand or southeast asia period over 83 dollars there are hundreds of foods to choose from so you cannot eat everything you really have to prioritize and pick your favorites so you dont miss out that is not unlimited all you can eat for all day that is all you can eat for two and a half hours i mean it seems like it should be enough but i mean if youre like me im like a grazing animal i want to eat from morning to night if i can sneak into the bathroom watch an episode of seinfeld come back continue eating but no music welcome inside i am going to say this is one of the most extravagant beautiful glorious gigantic buffets ive ever seen in my life music right off the bat i got meat right here hello sir can i have some pork belly please and lamb rack and oh god prime rib or beef rump and prime rib please the high pressure situation hes already got the pork belly on here there we go oh my gosh look at all this meat and beef i just got it all i cant help it right here you have all the sides pepper sauce lamb juice mushroom sauce any kind of flavor combinations you want with your meat im gonna grab some of this and head to the table all right we have our first course right here im always starting with the meat because that is how you get your moneys worth i love the selection of meats they have here this is a fat crunchy piece of pork belly with some sweet soy sauce so juicy crunchy incredible texture on there here this is the lamb chop super soft tender moist still warm from the grill music oh sure lord one of the best pieces of meat ive had at any buffet ever that beautiful natural lamby flavor just brought out without a ton of spices its just some simple salt im not sure what else they put on there but maybe almost nothing this is some beef prime rump i think its called wait is that a real cut im getting a little soy sauce mixed with some mushroom a little east meets west here mushroom with a little bit of sweet soy sauce that actually works somehow the prime rump or prime wait prime rib oh its prime rib and beef rum even more than prime rib or beef rum most guys are looking for some prime rum but youre not gonna find that at this buffet one more bite some soy sauce a mushroom sauce oh very nice im gonna eat as much as i can in the next two hours thats all i have is two hours that was round one right now im in search of round two and there are so many options right here you can get a shabu youre going to be able to cook all this meat in these broths they also have a ton of mushrooms to choose from as well then this is the hot and sour soup with seafood im pretty sure thats just tom yum but they put it in english so we know what the heck it is right here you can see a giant line of people this is how you know this is where i gotta be right now this is the grilled seafood and they have some giant prawns this is where you can start making back some ground on all that money you spend but youre also gonna waste a lot of time hello could i have four please they have an assembly line it starts down there with the raw shrimp and as it cooks it moves down and then he toasts it right at the end oh we got a fresh batch right here ive got my shrimp now its not enough for a whole round im going to show you some of the other sections they have right behind me is the dim sum now what they do is they have these cute small plates but if youre smart oops whats this a giant plate yes here we have some hakao and some shumai she might as well get a little busted lets try it and this i dont even know how this works do you just what oh my gosh okay i asked some people who know what the hell is going on thanks guys that is some beautiful fish fillet music this is the famous iberico ham looks like a bear took a bite out of that leg this whole leg cost hundreds of dollars at least round two i gotta say the only thing that sucks is that this took 17 minutes just to acquire we are starting with these shrimp these are river prawns and in thailand they get huge you get some of that head butter im gonna dip it in this sauce it might be better than lobster this is very tender its got that fatty orange part here this is the part thats gonna get thrown away almost anywhere you go in the usa that here is what folks love and it adds just a really deep rich smoky flavor music the sauce is so delicious its spicy its light its aromatic its citrusy its a perfect combination for really any type of seafood right here is the miracle ham made from that whole freaking leg of a little porky pork it doesnt have a flavor where you go oh thats why thats expensive its very satisfying i love it but i also love pepperoni from quick drink probably just as much im letting my white trash side come out a little bit at the dim sum station i found this guy right here its probably a steamed sea bass oh thats delicious the fish is very tender its sweet salty has some mushroom flavor and onion flavor and that is the perfect one biter the hakkais looking pretty good im gonna put that in the chili oil um acceptable okay lets try the shumai they say whoever folds the shoe mic they dont even let you touch this stuff until youve been watching this chef do it for years on end this guy took a weekend course perhaps its not the best looking dim sum ive ever seen yeah its okay so it tastes like one level above gas station dim sum to be fair 7eleven has some very good dim sum in thailand its hard to nail everything when you have this many foods you gotta specialize in a handful of things they just ran out of fog so the gentleman back here is cooking up a load of it depending on my spy camera enhanced and hence and hence and hence thats not looking enhanced at all that looks like he hits it with the glaze and that is ready to go i should do this but these people are here i just saw them get a burger why would you get a burger theres every food here i think its a chicken burger which is the worst kind of burger this is like a snack between rounds this is the foie gras so juicy you can look inside this very very soft fatty buttery tender and all those nice words music fatty jiggly sweet thats what it says on my tinder profile it thats what he used to say sorry now that weve had about three different rounds of food lets take a look at some of the stations we have missed so far theres no way im gonna be able to eat everything so lets see what could have been welcome to the white asparagus station here theyve got white asparagus here i would call this miscellaneous meats theyve got meatballs baked chicken theyve got stuff called a little bit of everything you saw this already this is the dim sum and this whole area is chinese related weve had stirfried fish ma that is the air bladder of the fish you can see it right here then they also have some cooking ducks island oysters i know they had oysters over there good for you guys the oyster bar with oysters from thailand from france all over the place the only problem is im 50 50 on oysters im not gonna eat any oysters today im good with the foie gras can i order eight of these i wasnt gonna do it but they have all these different oysters ive tried all the vietnamese oysters im gonna try to thai one now and see what i think theres noodle soup with wagyu beef slices and a beef stew this one yes please i get to pick my noodles so they put everything in the basket right here which is beautiful let that boil up shes giving me a couple different meatballs gonna blanch up some of this beef and then this is a bunch of stewed beef and tendon looks amazing here is the broth right here we have round number four this is whats so fun about doing these buffets when else would you have a chinese soup in a thai oyster when else would you have a chinese soup and a thai oyster together at the same time in the same meal music of all the fancy things ive had today that is one of the best bites super braised beef thats just been boiling and boiling for hours this is that nice tenderness in my recent video i was in singapores chinatown complex and i had a whole plate full of tendons and i kept saying that they have so much fat and then you guys let me know that actually this no fat its basically all protein im getting swole for summer lets go music this bowl is delicious from head to toe i love it so much and then youve got this im gonna slap out some of this seafood sauce a little bit of chili sauce a little bit of fried shallots and music the woman filming me right now is ty and she was just like nailed it music im not an oyster boy that is pretty undeniable very nice seafood flavor balance out with some of the seafood sauce the chili sauce and then a little bit of texture with the fried shallots thats art behind me you can see the dessert section they have over 50 desserts alone if you just focus on dessert you could not even try half of them one mango sticky rice please check it out guys mango is already on the plate heres the sticky rice and then this is what ties it all together a sweet coconut cream that is like frosting from the jungle we have our final brown this is my favorite dessert in all of southeast asia coconut cream rice mango and these nuts right very nice first of all the coconut cream its like the convergence of coconut milk and evaporated milk together and then mango this is why i love southeast asia fresh ripe super sweet and melt in your mouth delicious how many times have you gotten mango in the midwest and it tastes like gasoline for some reason well this one does not this one tastes like diesel for 80 bucks you could probably come close to getting your money back but then you just had to be eating foie gras the whole time i say when youre here try a little bit of everything and take your time ive had tuba face today i need a nap soon but first i need to tell you which buffet i think gave me the most bang for my buck guys that is the end of the video today ive gone to the cheapest and most expensive buffets you will find in bangkok thailand now i had to decide which one gave me the most bang for my buck which is really tough to do obviously both very cool in their own way i love that there is a buffet that exists out there in reality that is less than two dollars and you can try over a dozen different foods but i also love the marriotts buffet theres so many different options to choose from i would say if i had to pick one to go to again i feel guilty saying this but id go back to the marriage no thats not to say that i didnt love the first location its a very cool place if you want to not pay very much money but get to try a lot of different thai foods but marriott i mean come on they had prime rum that is it for this one thank you so much for watching let me know if you want to see more buffets and more countries in the comments down below otherwise ill see you later goodbye peace out

pUzEz5T0HU4,global poverty surges amid ukraine war  dw news,News,71 million more people are facing poverty thats according to a new un study it says its the consequence of soaring food and energy prices unleashed from russias war in ukraine households are scrimping charities are scrambling for donations and families are under pressure in this plantation in bannon yossiane hodonu is choosing a batch of cooking bananas at her meal she will turn them into plaintained flour a locally produced alternative to wheat flour her little shop has almost doubled its production since the beginning of the russian invasion of ukraine applause before the war in ukraine i produce at least 80 kilos per month but now i produce up to 150 kilos per month when the market is on the war quickly aggravated the dire inequalities already caused by the kavin 19 pandemic and climate change over the last couple of years as a consequence west africa and many other poor countries are now facing their worst food security crisis since the start of the world food program zero angers initiative in 2015 with kovid what we saw is effects that work through labor markets lockdowns uh and income that was slow and cumulative but had a very strong impact uh over time so the official estimates are about 125 million people falling into poverty over about 18 months so what we find right now is that three months of inflation have drawn about 71 million people into poverty today more than 828 million people are undernourished worldwide its 150 million more than 2021 its a dire reminder of how the rise in inflation and the global disruption of supply chains can drive inequalities affecting hundreds of million of poor people around the world harald von vitska is an agricultural economist at humboldt university in berlin he joins me for more uh food supplies have been massively hit over the past few months weve been talking about this since the beginning of the war can we say whether the situation is getting better or worse it has gotten worse worth worse and its a matter of both as increasing scarcity on international agricultural commodity markets and its a matter of distribution and its a combination of two things one is that the times of plenty are over in world agriculture the world food economy has entered a new era of scarcity what weve seen since 2000 is that agricultural commodity prices have tended to rise and on top of this we have the war in ukraine which is aggravating things even more in 2000 the price of wheat was at 250 per bushel before the war um in ukraine this number had doubled to five dollars per bushel and we are now at 850 so three times more than three times what the price of wheat was around the turn of the millennium and it is clear that this must have a significant impact on hunger around the world and in my book we are close to 1 billion humans who are hungry right now those are people who have 190 or less per person and they in purchasing power and we have to spend 70 or more of the amiga income on food and its quite clear that this must significantly increase hunger around the world what about efforts to offset some of those uh aberrations in trade routes that have been caused by the war efforts by ngos efforts by groups to push more uh trade to other places even by nations such as brazil for example filling in more with wheat where in where nations like india pull back is that making any kind of difference in the short term in the short term we have indeed the potential to increase food supplies around the world and one of the most significant sources would be to get ukrainian grain and other agricultural commodities to the world markets for this to actually happen however we need at least a ceasefire in that part of the world but also the european union has some potential to mobilize additional resources for food crop production by discontinuing temporarily the greening program which acts to take land out of agricultural commodity production i want to ask you really briefly is it possible that the rising price of wheat will actually encourage more planting that in the middle term could actually answer some of these problems that may not help in the short term yes and that is happening already every year by on my book we lose four and a half million hectares in natural habitats because of acreage expansion and these high prices dramatically increase the incentives for an additional increase of the agricultural acreage around the globe with dramatic consequences for climate and uh biodiversity all right well have to leave it there howard von vitska with humble university in berlin im afraid were going to leave it there thank you very much
