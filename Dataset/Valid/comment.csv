gpYxTj2HBbI,honestly it wouldnt surprise me if liverpool reached the final next year again and thats coming from a united fan they never give up
gpYxTj2HBbI,as a utd fan klopps can only handle the pressure and liverpool surely played better but unlucky respect to all the hard work the lads done congrats to real madrid

8BXG6ojA4l8,i applaud honda for continuing to make cars for car enthusiasts at every level
8BXG6ojA4l8,this is the review ive been waiting for ive been thinking about getting the sporttouring hatch but didnt want to order one without seeing a topher review
8BXG6ojA4l8,i think this is the perfect spec and color option for this car looks so good
8BXG6ojA4l8,id imagine the design of the exterior and interior is polarizing but personally i find it very beautiful
8BXG6ojA4l8,that shifts nice thats how to do a drivers review showing the performance to its full  mint
8BXG6ojA4l8,i got the 2022 automatic version of this in red and i absolutely love it great all around car love the design 1010 would recommend
8BXG6ojA4l8,i really miss the last year model loved how flashy it was looked a lot more sport too this looks like an audi to me
8BXG6ojA4l8,cant wait to see the video on the na 20l version that would be the trim id choose wish they offered the manual in the sedans
8BXG6ojA4l8,10 seconds in but confident i will enjoy this very much thank you for doing what you do
8BXG6ojA4l8,glad to hear they fixed the nonsi shifter on this gen previous gens was a dealbreaker
8BXG6ojA4l8,honda knocked it out of the park with this one  glad to see them back on their game
8BXG6ojA4l8,the rear end gives me strong crosstour vibes im sure it looks pretty good at night with the lighting
8BXG6ojA4l8,great video as always topher  would love to see you drive an ae86 gts eventually those are classics
8BXG6ojA4l8,its everything i want in a new car definitely picking one up soon
8BXG6ojA4l8,im in love with this car absolutely adore that they kept the manual on the hatachback since thats the best combo in my opinion
8BXG6ojA4l8,this is my favorite video so far on the new civic with the manual transmission  driver pov for the win
8BXG6ojA4l8,honda always imo has the best engine layout in the bay out of anyone like you exactly said everything is just right there and easily so accessible
8BXG6ojA4l8,looks like a
8BXG6ojA4l8,seems like a great car but isnt 29k a bit steep for a nonsi civic
8BXG6ojA4l8,the rear end is near perfect
8BXG6ojA4l8,i love when people pat their shoes before entering a car
8BXG6ojA4l8,bro you drove that car i am happy to see you do that as opposed to other youtubers who dont push cars like that
8BXG6ojA4l8,kudos to honda for finally once again offering a stick with leather had they done that with the currentgen accord id have bought one
8BXG6ojA4l8,great review  rpms seem high in 6th gear at 75 mph  any idea on highway mileage
8BXG6ojA4l8,such a shame that this brilliant car is being released at a time when you cant buy one
8BXG6ojA4l8,very much impressed by your way of explaining things
8BXG6ojA4l8,the hatchback version looks dope good thing it comes with a 6speed manual i thought honda will only make cvt civics
8BXG6ojA4l8,nice review really love the manual
8BXG6ojA4l8,i like to watch how you drive you can see how vtech pulls after 5k rpm really sweet
8BXG6ojA4l8,this video just increased my love for manual transmission cars
8BXG6ojA4l8,love the shoe tap before getting back in the car a person id let drive my personal vehicle
8BXG6ojA4l8,very impressive  awesome review like always
8BXG6ojA4l8,i was thinking that this looked like a sedanhatchback hybrid and then you mentioned its design
8BXG6ojA4l8,definitely a new benchmark awesome car
8BXG6ojA4l8,the topher
8BXG6ojA4l8,i legit cant wait till these hit the dealers also love that you are whipin through the mi back roads
8BXG6ojA4l8,that interior looks so good especially good for a honda
8BXG6ojA4l8,nice video what rpm do you feel the vtec turn on and is it strong like the older hondas
8BXG6ojA4l8,one of the few instances where i prefer the sedan over the hatchback design
8BXG6ojA4l8,for me its very weird to have a button handbrake and a manual transmission
8BXG6ojA4l8,i may be stating the obvious but you are very good at what you do thank you
8BXG6ojA4l8,honda absolutely killed it once again
8BXG6ojA4l8,fantastic review loved it
8BXG6ojA4l8,wonderful roads your driving on and great driving my friend
8BXG6ojA4l8,that rev hang might be for emissions as it prevents unburnt fuel from escaping
8BXG6ojA4l8,this civic looks amazing i like the hatchback style
8BXG6ojA4l8,this is probably the best review ive seen with the new civic so far i hope youll do the new acura  integra 2023
8BXG6ojA4l8,personally like this over 10th gen hatch and i think it should look pretty if honda makes a 3 door hatch with this design
8BXG6ojA4l8,sport 2l manual for me i would love to test drive one when its actually possible
8BXG6ojA4l8,insane to think i build these cars for a living
8BXG6ojA4l8,probably the closest thing to a manual wagon ill be able to get now if only awd was an option lol
8BXG6ojA4l8,manual in the top of the line hatchback  respect to honda
8BXG6ojA4l8,cant wait to watch the civic sport hatchback review thats the one im aiming for
8BXG6ojA4l8,touring trims are the bomb you get everything honda has to offer
8BXG6ojA4l8,this makes me really look forward to the type r  thanks for the great vid
8BXG6ojA4l8,this is a really attractive offering now looks great great interior manual what else could you want slap o some hybrid awd system and it would sell even more
8BXG6ojA4l8,this is exactly the kind of video i want when im looking to buy a car
8BXG6ojA4l8,great review imo the civic 2021 looks slightly better from the front and the back but this car is bae
8BXG6ojA4l8,glad to hear they fixed the transmission for this gen i have a 10th gen hatchback sport and some of the gears 2nd and 4th are clunky as hell
8BXG6ojA4l8,i love how you straightened out all the vents
8BXG6ojA4l8,i cant wait for the type r to be released that and the integra are what im waiting for
8BXG6ojA4l8,my only real complaint is you only get monochrome colors with the manual really like the boost blue
fxySIiLNQrs,nhl playoffs is so much fun to watch as a nba junkie ive been watching the hockey postseason since 2018 and been watching every postseason since
fxySIiLNQrs,im a basketball junkie but i have to admit hockey is the hardest chip to win
fxySIiLNQrs,pk has the charisma and the potential to get hockey a real seat at the table when it comes to mainstream sports media
fxySIiLNQrs,shocked that theyre doing a hockey segment
fxySIiLNQrs,theres no out of bounds in hockey great quote
fxySIiLNQrs,pk is so good as a hockey analyst i hope he does it after he hangs the skates up
fxySIiLNQrs,i love pk this dude needs his own show
fxySIiLNQrs,nhl definitely has the best playoffs really no debate about it
fxySIiLNQrs,i played competitive basketball for 15 years
fxySIiLNQrs,lmao pk jumped right into the point sas said nothing
fxySIiLNQrs,w they should do more of nhl
fxySIiLNQrs,its hockey nothing else comes close after every series ends theyre about five or six players coming out with 34 injuries
fxySIiLNQrs,first take needs more hockey segments
fxySIiLNQrs,we need to see more of stephen a  talking hockey and debating it with players or former players especially to get an education on the sport
fxySIiLNQrs,its actually hockey its such a hard sport that has a lot of flukes
fxySIiLNQrs,a hockey segment yes
fxySIiLNQrs,more nhl please 
fxySIiLNQrs,pk oozes charisma i want to see him have a show with stephan a
fxySIiLNQrs,love basketball and hockey need to talk about it more
fxySIiLNQrs,joe thornton played the entire 2016 stanley cup playoffs on a torn acl tyler seguin played with a torn labrum in the 2020 playoffs
fxySIiLNQrs,pk was absolutely right about everything
fxySIiLNQrs,stephen a be trolling
fxySIiLNQrs,everything pk said is on point
fxySIiLNQrs,stanley cup hardest championship to win
fxySIiLNQrs,for a fan of all american sports the nhl playoffs are definitely the toughest playoffs
fxySIiLNQrs,its rare for sas to be outmatched pk made stephen recognize the importance of hockey
fxySIiLNQrs,it has to be hockey penalties can bring any good run to a screeching halt no other sport pulls players from the game to give another team advantage like that
fxySIiLNQrs,we need more of pk
fxySIiLNQrs,its true that theres nothing like playoff hockey but im giving it to the world series championship baseball is just the hardest sport overall
fxySIiLNQrs,not to mention how unpredictable playoff hockey is
fxySIiLNQrs,honestly the two sports most people at least in america dont watch are the toughest hockey and soccer
fxySIiLNQrs,we need more hockey
fxySIiLNQrs,respect to pk shouting out gsw
fxySIiLNQrs,all playoffs are absolutely just flat out fun to watch but there is nothing  like hockeys playoffs nothing
fxySIiLNQrs,nhl players will play with a broken foot or leg to win the stanley cup while nba players will sit out because they have a strained backjust saying
fxySIiLNQrs,if wayne gretzky never scored a goal he would still be the alltime leader in points
fxySIiLNQrs,someone who wont let stephen a talk
fxySIiLNQrs,live its not contest theres nothing like a love hockey game and i grew up watching the nba
fxySIiLNQrs,hockey and basketball basically have the same format and tbh golf obviously lacks physicality but you have to beat the most amount of competitors
fxySIiLNQrs,pk actually good for growing the sport he interesting funny he was considered a headache playing for montreal
fxySIiLNQrs,pk best slew footer in the game
fxySIiLNQrs,nfl is single elimination which makes it the toughest postseason to win typically in a 7 game series the better team wins nfl and nhl by far toughest to win
fxySIiLNQrs,there have been multiple players in the history of hockey to play games with broken ribs thats all you gotta say
fxySIiLNQrs,nhl has more parity and its unpredictable more exciting
fxySIiLNQrs,if march madness counts that one is definitely the hardest in sports imo
fxySIiLNQrs,agreed with pk 100 heres my list 1 nhl 2 nfl 3 mlb 4 nba
fxySIiLNQrs,finally about hockey after nfl  nhl is by far the most entertaining sports 
fxySIiLNQrs,i love nba but nhl is tough i went to a game and they scored 1 mf goal
fxySIiLNQrs,hockey is the most entertaining and the best playoffs to watch definitely the hardest championship to win just my opinion
fxySIiLNQrs,of the all the major sports i think baseball is probably the hardest to win it has so many more variables than the other major team sports
fxySIiLNQrs,hockey scores 70 is a blow out 32  21  is he saying the scores are too low
fxySIiLNQrs,first take is actually talking about hockey
fxySIiLNQrs,pk is the man
fxySIiLNQrs,the nhl playoffs had 5 game 7 games in the first round

fxySIiLNQrs,big facts good job pk
fxySIiLNQrs,facts with golden state thats literally hockey on the basketball court
fxySIiLNQrs,toughest trophy to win in all of sports the champions league trophy is harder to win
fxySIiLNQrs,subban nailed it
fxySIiLNQrs,pk just shut that man down  tell him
fxySIiLNQrs,hands down the stanley cup is the hardest trophy to win
fxySIiLNQrs,im glad to see my guy pk subban talking hockey on first take and hes right the stanley cup is the most difficult championship to win
fxySIiLNQrs,hockey by far the hardest to win the chip
fxySIiLNQrs,pk is so right if we could measure the exertion and pain between the four sports hockey would surpass every other sport
fxySIiLNQrs,you wanna bring hockey main stream bring whoever this dude is back on 2x3 week during the season and watch it go bonkers
fxySIiLNQrs,if those 21 32 games are close and exciting and back and forth fans definitely wanna see that
fxySIiLNQrs,go colorado avalanche

ZTIccw4pGLE,this is the best drivetribe video in quite some time i thinkabsolutely amazing piece

WafWphQzUlo,i would say emilys poutine probably the best out of these poutine dont need to be fancy just simply and delicious
WafWphQzUlo,three amazing people on this episode  i was privileged to have worked with chef chris at ice
WafWphQzUlo,quebecer here standing and cheering in emilys corner this is exactly how id make it on a thursday night 3
WafWphQzUlo,lorenzo you didnt get the squeak because your cheese was aged you only get that squeak with very fresh cheese
WafWphQzUlo,as a canadian emily has my vote dont overcomplicate a comfort food plus the second layer of cheese curds would certainly be a welcome surprise
WafWphQzUlo,honestly emily hit the nail on the head with her simple down to the basics rendition of poutine
WafWphQzUlo,emily doing a canadian dish ive clicked the like button in less than a minute now lets watch it all the way totally live up to expectations
WafWphQzUlo,seems like roses segment has been cut down its a shame i liked when they had more time to go over things for everyone at each step
WafWphQzUlo,lorenzos cheese probably didnt squeak because its aged cheddar and not a young cheese emilys looked so good
WafWphQzUlo,every time lorenzo laughs in these videos an angel gets its chicken wings
WafWphQzUlo,ok you got epicuriouss resident canadian and ketchup queen to be in this episode i can like it
WafWphQzUlo,i love emily she is so sweet
WafWphQzUlo,im from quebec the origin of poutine and the best poutine is the simplies fries gravy cheese chick chick
WafWphQzUlo,yet another canadian joining the chorus emily won battle poutine with her authentic thursday night poutine  and hells yeah hosers the cheese curd should squeak like anything
WafWphQzUlo,not going to lie but chriss looks absolutely divine what a great addition to the show
WafWphQzUlo,i dont think anyone eating poutine is worrying about their cholesterol can confirm as a canadian
WafWphQzUlo,im from quebec and im sooo happy you talked about the squeak the most important thing in a poutine tbh
WafWphQzUlo,i actually like how the level 2 and 3 chef made their own version it may not be authentic poutine but that way you still get different dishes
WafWphQzUlo,i would love if everyone would come together at the end and try every version
WafWphQzUlo,okay but emily is the only canadian here so she shot up 2 levels and knocked everyone down whether or not you guys want to admit it
WafWphQzUlo,2 of these are not poutine  just saying
WafWphQzUlo,rose is right the squeak is essential for a good poutine
WafWphQzUlo,one day just one day we will see lorenzo become a lvl 3 chef
WafWphQzUlo,love all of these recipes but in my opinion the best poutine is simple just fries gravy and cheese i think emilys is the most realistic and classic
WafWphQzUlo,for the first time emily for the win unrefrigerated cheescurds are the way
WafWphQzUlo,poutine isin my humble opiniona dish that benefits from being really simple and lowcost
WafWphQzUlo,montrealer here and emilys poutine is the only legit poutine level 2 and level 3 poutines wouldnt even be served during poutine week quebec strong
WafWphQzUlo,franks gravy field wasnt ready for harvest  in time for this episode
WafWphQzUlo,as a canadian the one i want to try most is emilys
WafWphQzUlo,while all these poutines are good in their own way emily nailed it poutine isnt meant to be fancy its fast food at 1am
WafWphQzUlo,they  all used cheese curds  like emily said poutine must have curds thats what makes it poutine
WafWphQzUlo,tbh emilys  would be the only one i would want such a classic with the cheese curds and brown gravy
WafWphQzUlo,lorenzo used ketchup and emily didnt there must be a glitch in the matrix
WafWphQzUlo,duck confit poutine sounds like putting caviar on a hot dog lol
WafWphQzUlo,i had that involuntary  awwww moment when emily dug in and said she missed her mom
WafWphQzUlo,when food gives you i miss my mom vibes you know its good
WafWphQzUlo,as a fellow east coast canadian im just glad no one used shredded cheese instead of cheese curds
WafWphQzUlo,emily is the only person who understood the assignment all of this extra fanfare doesnt make poutine any better and usually makes it worse
WafWphQzUlo,as a canadian i want emilys poutine
WafWphQzUlo,loved the episode and the level 3 was incredibly fancy and extra i love it when they are like that its like theyre flexing their immense knowledge
WafWphQzUlo,surely for poutine emily is the expert being canadian
WafWphQzUlo,emily for the win finally a recipe where the simplest is the best
WafWphQzUlo,id be curious to taste level 2 and 3 but as a qubecer im team emily on this one go girl
WafWphQzUlo,i think my preference would be emilys cheese curds and lorenzos fries gravy and garnish i think i know what im making for dinner
WafWphQzUlo,i have
WafWphQzUlo,emily why make my own cheese curds when i can buy them i live in canada
WafWphQzUlo,loving how my love for emily has only increased since her first appearance that being said her being canadian makes a lot of sense
WafWphQzUlo,as a fellow canadian im all over emilys
WafWphQzUlo,lorenzo added the ketchup in a major plot twist but emily made it exactly how i would make it and love every bite
WafWphQzUlo,emily humming oh canada really did it for me
WafWphQzUlo,so no ones gonna talk about how he tossed his poutine like its a salad
WafWphQzUlo,as a french canadian im really scared to watch this
WafWphQzUlo,as a canadian i like emilys the most its such a classic and never disappoints
WafWphQzUlo,emily my spanish speaking 247 taco lady in the farmers market
WafWphQzUlo,when i saw emily and then lorenzo i was absolutely distraught that frank wasnt the level 3
WafWphQzUlo,thanks rose for explaining why emilys and chris curds squeaked but lorenzos didnt loved this episode
WafWphQzUlo,emily has the power to be a level 2 chef she just chooses not to and honestly respect
WafWphQzUlo,emilys commitment to level 1 chef has saved poutine
WafWphQzUlo,i love that she said its a french canadian dish from quebec i think it hits all the marks
WafWphQzUlo,emily really is a whole mood
WafWphQzUlo,that canadian flaglet was the

aiU4xQ7ICM4,at 71 shaquile oneal is one of the strongest center in the nba
aiU4xQ7ICM4,fact this guy is so fast that in his 200m in high school he would have placed 6th in the olympics if they recorded it
aiU4xQ7ICM4,imagine how hard it takes to not accidentally run into a kid so they dont cry
aiU4xQ7ICM4,at 63 and 286lbs brock lesnar was one of the biggest heavyweight fighters in the octagon
aiU4xQ7ICM4,tyreek just gave those kids a memory of a lifetime  what a great guy
aiU4xQ7ICM4,i want to see this with marshawn lynch but instead hes just trucking everybody
aiU4xQ7ICM4,when its round 46 in zombies and you are the only one left alive
aiU4xQ7ICM4,him running faster than the all the other players in the league is my guess
aiU4xQ7ICM4,this big dog needs to get his rest
aiU4xQ7ICM4,lol kid said you rigged it they couldnt get that flag off when he fell though
aiU4xQ7ICM4,kids you rigged it
aiU4xQ7ICM4,to test his speed and confidence we put against 8 year old seems legit
aiU4xQ7ICM4,yeah lets test tyreke hills speed against nfl players by putting him up against middle schoolers makes sense
aiU4xQ7ICM4,would have been interesting if his training kicked in and he accidentally stiff armed a kid
aiU4xQ7ICM4,why they pulling his pants down at the end
aiU4xQ7ICM4,after seeing this now i know what it would look like if tyreek hill goes against 40 zombies
aiU4xQ7ICM4,who else is surprised he didnt plow somebody
aiU4xQ7ICM4,i use to watch him run from 1 county to the next and not stop once to even take a breath thats what makes him fast hard work and determination
aiU4xQ7ICM4,what makes tyreek hill the fastest player in the nfl
aiU4xQ7ICM4,im so happy he didnt break the arms of all these kids
aiU4xQ7ICM4,lets be honest whos here after the chiefs won the superbowl
aiU4xQ7ICM4,looks like the patriots defense
aiU4xQ7ICM4,watching pro athletes actually try against kids makes me happy inside to see such unfairness does good for the soul
aiU4xQ7ICM4,tyreek running away from these like they were his own
aiU4xQ7ICM4,from that day forward he does it every time when he practices
aiU4xQ7ICM4,who wants to see him race desean jackson and john ross
aiU4xQ7ICM4,i love this guys confidence
aiU4xQ7ICM4,anytime i see him run now im going to imagine he always makes that sound
aiU4xQ7ICM4,man no wonder the chiefs can score the way they do thats amazing
aiU4xQ7ICM4,thats cool
aiU4xQ7ICM4,guy do you think anybody can catch you
aiU4xQ7ICM4,this was one of my favorite sports science videos
aiU4xQ7ICM4,this big dog needs to get his rest lmao
aiU4xQ7ICM4,the kid at the end was hilarious  you rigged it thats cheating lol
aiU4xQ7ICM4,i love his confidence
aiU4xQ7ICM4,good for tyreek for doing this this is one of the few chances these kids will get to play around with an nfl football star
aiU4xQ7ICM4,this guy must have been a god at capture the flag
aiU4xQ7ICM4,this big dog needs some rest hahaha man thats awesome for him to do that hes fast af
aiU4xQ7ICM4,sports science lets test the speed of the fastest man in the nfl
aiU4xQ7ICM4,if you know his track and field stats its very obvious how fast he is
aiU4xQ7ICM4,they got better defense than patriots
aiU4xQ7ICM4,answer he runs faster than the other players
aiU4xQ7ICM4,notice how close his legsfeet are when he initiates his sprint
aiU4xQ7ICM4,when i was younger i could fly like that miss those days
aiU4xQ7ICM4,this is the new and improved how many 2nd graders do you think you can take on at once
aiU4xQ7ICM4,all i know is he helped me win my fantasy football league dude is fast
aiU4xQ7ICM4,tyreek yelling is the best part of the first run
aiU4xQ7ICM4,this reminds me of playing easy mode on madden
aiU4xQ7ICM4,he broke the speed record and while probably still in first gear
aiU4xQ7ICM4,youd think sports science had never seen sports before with the gear they give these guys
aiU4xQ7ICM4,dudedo u think anybody can catch you
aiU4xQ7ICM4,dam he is good got through all them kids at once
aiU4xQ7ICM4,he could be a good practice machinerunner for other players and kids to catch him as a target in a way
aiU4xQ7ICM4,this big dog needs get some rest kid a gangster at the end
aiU4xQ7ICM4,brandin cooks ran 224 mph in a game and he changed direction he wasnt running straight forward
aiU4xQ7ICM4,i love this guy
aiU4xQ7ICM4,no one is faster than me
aiU4xQ7ICM4,when your from the same small town and schools as tyreek hill
aiU4xQ7ICM4,tyreek hill is one of my favorite football players
aiU4xQ7ICM4,we brought in some football players with an even lower center of gravity than he has nice way of saying they brought in shorter people than he is
aiU4xQ7ICM4,what makes him the fastest god giving ability
aiU4xQ7ICM4,i love how he was having fun with the kids
aiU4xQ7ICM4,tyreek nobody can catch me
aiU4xQ7ICM4,could you imagine one of these kids getting hit at 20mph lmao
aiU4xQ7ICM4,this man literally did the age old question of how many waves of 4th graders can you take on
aiU4xQ7ICM4,heres a guy that when he runs he goes faster
aiU4xQ7ICM4,tyreek hillhold on wait wait
aiU4xQ7ICM4,think they should switch roles and see how fast jimmy saville wouldve been if he was let loose in a field of 43 kids
aiU4xQ7ICM4,credit to him for not breaking any kids arm this time
aiU4xQ7ICM4,quick answer he moves faster than his opponents
aiU4xQ7ICM4,broke that kids ankles at
aiU4xQ7ICM4,just the sounds tyreek made running
aiU4xQ7ICM4,now put him up against 43 adults
aiU4xQ7ICM4,i would be the happiest kid alive if i could meet any pro football player
aiU4xQ7ICM4,this big dog needs to get its rest
aiU4xQ7ICM4,i new he was fastbut got dam im truly amazed
aiU4xQ7ICM4,this men is unbelievable
aiU4xQ7ICM4,when youre playing 50v50 and youre the last one left 
aiU4xQ7ICM4,what makes him the fastest
aiU4xQ7ICM4,remember when sports science used to actually break down the science of why athletes were so good
aiU4xQ7ICM4,that one kid who grabbed his flag mustve felt so proud
aiU4xQ7ICM4,this big dog needs some rest
aiU4xQ7ICM4,man these kids are brave asf running at this guy and not away
aiU4xQ7ICM4,they put this man thru ultra instinct training

6Y-PeuGFaHc,their ability to participate with dignity in social spaces
6Y-PeuGFaHc,shes very well spoken im normally embarrassingly reactive to discussions of this nature but i feel calm
6Y-PeuGFaHc,i need to know what shes advocating for how exactly does she want to equalise the genetic differences between us
6Y-PeuGFaHc,genetics are given too much emphasis because were still relatively new to understanding it there are factors such as the environment massive impact and epigenetics
6Y-PeuGFaHc,i really like this i hope they continue to advance on this to help all people regardless of skills imrpove themselves to their fullest
6Y-PeuGFaHc,i still cant believe that after hundreds of years our best solutions for disabilities come down to a chair with wheels or a white stick
6Y-PeuGFaHc,using a few specific geneseducationenvironment findings that are controversial within the antieugenic framework would have been helpful here
6Y-PeuGFaHc,your videos are always the best
6Y-PeuGFaHc,she should have elaborated on how genes affect education
6Y-PeuGFaHc,the best index to a persons character is how he treats people who cant do him any good and how he treats people who cant fight back
6Y-PeuGFaHc,correlation isnt causation some differences in groups simply show the damage of systemic racism and the like
6Y-PeuGFaHc,this topic has high potential to go awry even hearing the term genetic equality feels uncomfortable
6Y-PeuGFaHc,forget equality go your own way become who you are take care that a falling statue doesnt strike you dead
6Y-PeuGFaHc,here we go
6Y-PeuGFaHc,does anyone know how does adaptation mute the genetic code
6Y-PeuGFaHc,look at the disabled this is perfect
6Y-PeuGFaHc,thanks for this wasting my time on this beautiful video about absolutely nothing well done
6Y-PeuGFaHc,glasses arent always needed because of genetics ironically eyesight goes bad by forcing children to study theres numerous studies in korea and china proving this
6Y-PeuGFaHc,if you want equality  of wealth in a society  brutality and corruption have to be the the ruling philosophy
6Y-PeuGFaHc,great segment
6Y-PeuGFaHc,i just saw her past videos and all shes doing is beating around the bush and going to the point seems like she has an agenda
6Y-PeuGFaHc,just because you have wealth in material matter doesnt always make you smart or makes your genes better social equality or equity  or is it quantity 
6Y-PeuGFaHc,education income lifespan those are depressing metrics to quantify a lifes worth
6Y-PeuGFaHc,gotta love eugenics
6Y-PeuGFaHc,interesting info i have found we are as different as cheese and chork
6Y-PeuGFaHc,eugenics is an important subject
6Y-PeuGFaHc,if siblings are genetically unequal why do we think we can make the population in general equal
6Y-PeuGFaHc,very interesting
6Y-PeuGFaHc,maybe genetic engineering could help us achieve genetic choice or equality
6Y-PeuGFaHc,people will watch this video and hear what they want to hear
6Y-PeuGFaHc,wow good job she is finally where i was at 20 years ago when they told me that my egalitarianism was hateful
6Y-PeuGFaHc,the problem is how many ppl can consider political economical and science aspect that is a big mixture of knowledge
6Y-PeuGFaHc,genetics is destiny and thats what we should embrace and change with bioinformatics
6Y-PeuGFaHc,what a brilliant woman
6Y-PeuGFaHc,in the country in the world now before and after
6Y-PeuGFaHc,i wouldve been more interested in a book like this being written by someone who is actually involved in the hard sciences not psychology
6Y-PeuGFaHc,but genes are also affected by your environment
6Y-PeuGFaHc,congratulations this woman must be really brave to openly discuss such a controversial topic
6Y-PeuGFaHc,no matter what anyone tells youre the best beautiful and smart person to exist you are you
6Y-PeuGFaHc,thank you student loans for giving me a college education  i dont think i can ever repay you
6Y-PeuGFaHc,iq is massively correlated to wealth wealth is needed to bridge the iq gap with bmi and genomics
6Y-PeuGFaHc,sounds like a sales pitch for a master race
6Y-PeuGFaHc,females hypergamy is eugenics at the finest
6Y-PeuGFaHc,science doesnt fit well with your ideology
6Y-PeuGFaHc,she says science doesnt neatly fit into ideology while she tries to fit science into her egalitarian ideology think big consistently produces small thinking content
6Y-PeuGFaHc,i wonder if harden knows how her research will be misused by eugenicists
6Y-PeuGFaHc,some people still deny science behind iq differences between groups so until this is discussed honestly we will struggle with inequality
6Y-PeuGFaHc,why is a psychologist speaking with authority on genetic research
6Y-PeuGFaHc,equality would ruin natures order
6Y-PeuGFaHc,there was nothing wrong with the goal of eugenics to improve the human condition via pairing fit genes but often the means selected to achieve that goal were harmful
6Y-PeuGFaHc,intelligent people and beautiful people have advantages even if they are born poor luck
6Y-PeuGFaHc,wow first time i see quitoecuador as a stock image i like it
6Y-PeuGFaHc,if everyone had the same desirable generic traits personalityintelligencedrive society would cease to function because of lack of diversity in needed roles and job functions
6Y-PeuGFaHc,genetic differences between people are akin to differences between different breeds of dogs
hZjxtC-IrmI,as if caitlin didnt make everyone in that familys life difficult have several seats
hZjxtC-IrmI,caitlyn made alot of peoples lives difficult
hZjxtC-IrmI,i think the reason why pete is the person kim is in love with is because despite him being a celebrity he isnt high maintenance
hZjxtC-IrmI,im not even a kanye fan but this family is so toxic just when kanye started calming down someones gotta come around and poke him again mind your business caitlyn
hZjxtC-IrmI,caitlyn forgets how bruces transition made kriss life hell as well as that of kendall and kylies and the whole family
hZjxtC-IrmI,clearly you were difficult to live with pete has only been with kim for 6 months calm downpetes ex im sure have stories about himstop hating on kanye
hZjxtC-IrmI,can we remember that kim gets super excited about all her new boyfriends
hZjxtC-IrmI,kim has been through so much  seriously they have no idea what this
hZjxtC-IrmI,there are many times that i believed bruce is a submarine racist
hZjxtC-IrmI,they were basically the beverly hillbillies until kanye upgraded that entire hot mess of a familybut hes getting exactly what he deserveswe all saw this coming

hZjxtC-IrmI,and i bet kim was just as difficult as well caitlyn just wants to be relevant
hZjxtC-IrmI,kim deserves happiness
hZjxtC-IrmI,im so very happy for my queen kimball for her happiness
hZjxtC-IrmI,kylie is an awesome mother she needs to teach her older sister how to be the best mom
hZjxtC-IrmI,i hope kim doesnt break petes heart
hZjxtC-IrmI,caitlyn made kriss life very difficult he must talk about that
hZjxtC-IrmI,kim has made kanyes life difficult
hZjxtC-IrmI,if pete and kim break up what good will they say about pete
hZjxtC-IrmI,how about them leaving kanye alone and move on
hZjxtC-IrmI,lmao so every few years we get to hear how madly in love kim is thats a unique ability to be able to switch love on and off that fast
hZjxtC-IrmI,pete is kims puppy that show of love is going nowhere
hZjxtC-IrmI,caitlyn you are stunning and i like how you are your own person
hZjxtC-IrmI,did caitlyn go to kourtneys wedding now thats something tea
hZjxtC-IrmI,what about you and all that you put your family through do you think you made their life difficult or did you think that you wanted  some more attention
hZjxtC-IrmI,growing up rich and making poor life decisions must have been so hard on her  how sad  bwhahaha
hZjxtC-IrmI,this family need content for the new show why is cate talking when she made kris and all her his children life upside down
hZjxtC-IrmI,leave kanye alone  wish kim would go away and be happy  who really cares
hZjxtC-IrmI,caitlyn wasnt even rude she complimented kanye and said she liked him she just said the truth that everyone already knowskanye is difficult
hZjxtC-IrmI,he put his ex wife kris through a lot too he should not throw stones in a glass house
hZjxtC-IrmI,pete is a sweetheart
hZjxtC-IrmI,did caitlyn say the same about kim making ray js life difficult by lying on him about that tape
hZjxtC-IrmI,she has excuses for every husband pete will cope it too caitlyn keep ye name out of your mouth
hZjxtC-IrmI,bull these people trying to make kayne a villain this is what they do to every man in there life look at the dead bodies so over these people
hZjxtC-IrmI,i loveeee kete kim just seems like the old silly kim k we all knew when she first came out on the scene
hZjxtC-IrmI,caitlyn needs to realize that its a walkingtalking joke
hZjxtC-IrmI,i wonder did bruces adult kids feel like life was difficult when he wasnt coming around so much cuz he made another family with the kardashians glass houses throw stones
hZjxtC-IrmI,lmao unbelievable every time i see bruce i realize i had the greatest father on earth
hZjxtC-IrmI,im gonna call cap on the we need more comedians how bout we go back to the roast of alec baldwin bruce cant take a joke
hZjxtC-IrmI,these poor people still need this man for clicks views fame and fortunepoor things
hZjxtC-IrmI,they would do anything for fame and money he just praised him i cant his money must be going low again if you noticed he comes out with bs
hZjxtC-IrmI,wait 1 minute thats not catlyn talking thats bruce
hZjxtC-IrmI,pete comes across like a really nice guy and someone who legitimately cares i hope they have many years of happiness together
hZjxtC-IrmI,caitlin you made kris jenners life difficult youre a very complicated guy
hZjxtC-IrmI,what people told kanye before marying kim is true   
hZjxtC-IrmI,pete is  an honest man
hZjxtC-IrmI,but kanye made kims life difficult with his controlling ways and outbursts
hZjxtC-IrmI,i feel like the more kanye west says silence the more they find something to say about him in the media  keep that energy over there
hZjxtC-IrmI,of course petes treating her right hes dating upfor ye he dated down  its always better when a man dates up in some way
hZjxtC-IrmI,she looks good for someone who went through a lot
hZjxtC-IrmI,caitlin stop trying to stay relevant you shouldnt be speaking about kim or kanye we all know you envy the kardashians
hZjxtC-IrmI,awe this is so wholesome
hZjxtC-IrmI,kim looks so so much happier with pete
hZjxtC-IrmI,i guess kim approved this interview
hZjxtC-IrmI,kanye west  made kims life a living hell
hZjxtC-IrmI,she is starting to be a fan they don t even want you in the fam dont act like its all good

GT9k0i8CMMk,theres something so tragic about pensioners having to live in poverty after a lifetime of working
GT9k0i8CMMk,also never forget that mps are always in receipt of above inflation wage rises
GT9k0i8CMMk,the same here in germany the poorest always suffering and we have many of them in a country in which 15 of the population own 70 of all fortunes
GT9k0i8CMMk,its simple greed
GT9k0i8CMMk,neil macdonalds analyses are very informative more of this please
GT9k0i8CMMk,look how wages had been flat even slightly decreasing since 2010 and only making miniture gains in recent years
GT9k0i8CMMk,workers need a pay rise thats the bottom line here
GT9k0i8CMMk,producer prices are up 15 so at least 5point is to be expect for the next few months
GT9k0i8CMMk,the truth is the main stream media doesnt tell the whole story mainly the corporations are making record profits that might have to do with the inflation issue
GT9k0i8CMMk,so for pensions they have the money but not for the rail workers that is not fair
GT9k0i8CMMk,it all leads back to greedy energy producers who are purposely keeping production low to inflate prices a scaling tax on profit margins would dissuade price gouging
GT9k0i8CMMk,smart people learn from everything and everyone average people from their experiences and stupid people already have all answers
GT9k0i8CMMk,reminder boris did close 10 fire stations as mayor in london and cut 500 jobs of frontline firefighters
GT9k0i8CMMk,i still wonder how much of these increase in prices are done out of pure greed and using genuine increases as an excuse
GT9k0i8CMMk,this raises questions how we should protect workers and families with childrens
GT9k0i8CMMk,before in 2021 i pay 45 for full confirm tank of diesel in my van now in the middle of 2022 it is 150
GT9k0i8CMMk,government dosent court fuel food or housing in inflation so wth do they countreal inflation is 3040
GT9k0i8CMMk,uks inflation is cathy newmans fault her poor interview on jan 16 2018 led to todays high inflation
GT9k0i8CMMk,so thats the leveling up everyone is talking about interesting
GT9k0i8CMMk,you took the free moneythe great benefitsthe huge number of government employees who produce nothingnow you pay the price and there is nothing anyone can do about it
GT9k0i8CMMk,wouldnt inflation always be higher than previous years lol  the reason that were experiencing price hikes is because companies arnt being watched or controlled by government on price hikes
GT9k0i8CMMk,i dont know if chancellors salary is proportional to the work he does
GT9k0i8CMMk,why is 50 of the total fuel cost taken as tax the government must be loving the fuel increases
GT9k0i8CMMk,boris johnson mishandling of the economy   worst pm in living memories
GT9k0i8CMMk,britons thought that the animal farm was about ussr until theyve got more equal than others boriska as their pm
GT9k0i8CMMk,im starting to think the french had it right in 1792  heads should roll
GT9k0i8CMMk,wait a minute minute
GT9k0i8CMMk,on 4 january 2011 vat was raised to 20 percent by chancellor george osborne conservative party where it remains
GT9k0i8CMMk,ppl think things are gonna get better but they not they gonna make it get worse
GT9k0i8CMMk,i will forever be indebted to you
GT9k0i8CMMk,rails arent striking over wage rises  theyre striking due to safety concerns
GT9k0i8CMMk,ceos and upper management still taking obscene salaries and bonuses though
GT9k0i8CMMk,the english constitution is the solution
GT9k0i8CMMk,12 years of tory rule going great
GT9k0i8CMMk,voted boris over jeremy voted tory well here ya go
GT9k0i8CMMk,pms  work longer hours to cope with the rise
GT9k0i8CMMk,im done sitting tight for the award advance since i acquire23000 every 12 days of my investment
GT9k0i8CMMk,22 just graduated uni inflation is hitting hard
GT9k0i8CMMk,politicians can take a big cut in their incomes so they feel the pinch
GT9k0i8CMMk,lets all together thanks the tories
GT9k0i8CMMk,i personally feel food gone up by 25  not 8
GT9k0i8CMMk,despite the economic downturnim so happy
GT9k0i8CMMk,what did you think was gonna happen when they printed all the extra money during the pandemic
GT9k0i8CMMk,now you all know the lockdowns arent free will you still rush to your doorsteps to bang pots and pans when the next variant arrives
GT9k0i8CMMk,tescos very little help
GT9k0i8CMMk,would you rather have crypto or a pantry with 3 months worth of food and water
GT9k0i8CMMk,its almost like the endless lockdowns that channel 4 championed for 2 years werent a great idea
GT9k0i8CMMk,until the people start revolting the government will do as they see fit
GT9k0i8CMMk,britain claims that they had to leave european union because they were the ones making the economy all across europe healthy how do you like brexit now
GT9k0i8CMMk,ive lived alone for 10 years but no im honestly starting to go deep in debts
GT9k0i8CMMk,we need labour to save us start being friends with putin and have some cheap russian fuel and flour
GT9k0i8CMMk,please more money to zelensky
GT9k0i8CMMk,absolutely tragic nobody has any money anymore what can we do thank the tories and brexit and giving away our money to ukraine
GT9k0i8CMMk,food  going up
GT9k0i8CMMk,why cant businesses take less profit instead of passing all the costs onto customers
GT9k0i8CMMk,pay raise other side nipension deduction raise  groceries high hold ur ears with left hand or right its same
GT9k0i8CMMk,im sad and getting poor
GT9k0i8CMMk,dont worry jabba the hutt is in full control of the situation
GT9k0i8CMMk,inflation is from one place and one place only the uk government working with central banks to get money printed and distribute it through quatitive easing
GT9k0i8CMMk,boycott russia then blame them for inflation
GT9k0i8CMMk,no worries there are major influx of hong kong migrants to uk now
GT9k0i8CMMk,why dont the government cut fuel dutys on lorries then they can cut there prices the super markets can cut there prices everyones a winner
GT9k0i8CMMk,hydrogen production when on grid will anti inflation
GT9k0i8CMMk,interest rate need to go lot higher to battle inflation otherwise we will enter hyperinflation and that is very dangerous
GT9k0i8CMMk,well  sanctions has boomerang effects
GT9k0i8CMMk,decade of austerity for what tories to redo 2008 policy labour shouldve just stayed
GT9k0i8CMMk,when i see cost of fish raising remember britain is an island i have no more questions its clearly man made crisis
GT9k0i8CMMk,advice from the chancellor 
GT9k0i8CMMk,i shop at 10 at night and get all the reduced food some of it isnt that fresh but better than starving
GT9k0i8CMMk,sure keep sending millions to ukraine
GT9k0i8CMMk,2 meals a day  plan your budget  eat less junk foods  stop attending paying events you can pull thru my brits friends
GT9k0i8CMMk,they can host all these illegal immigrants in hotels and we are paying for it from our taxesi want pay raise to match the inflation
GT9k0i8CMMk,20 within a year
GT9k0i8CMMk,and the government is doing absolutely nothing about it
GT9k0i8CMMk,in my country sudan  inflation is around 300  91  is nothing to us
GT9k0i8CMMk,the country that once plundered the world cant give its citizens decent standard of living  how ironical and karmic
kgPT9_TLxEk,its pretty embarrassing when the opposing goalkeeper comes down and scores a ridiculous goal on you from a free kick
kgPT9_TLxEk,wow the bulls were allowed that he ran a 50m dash geez incredible sports moment for all the wrong reasons
kgPT9_TLxEk,love this kind of compilation thanks for the video 
kgPT9_TLxEk,ive watched so many compilation vods about incredible moments on sports but indeed this is the best ever great job
kgPT9_TLxEk,basketball moments should have tmacs 13 point in 35 sec
kgPT9_TLxEk,mission impossible
kgPT9_TLxEk,you forgot about 45 other impossible moments  messioh righthe is not human
kgPT9_TLxEk,grande cuevas 
kgPT9_TLxEk,nba scoring got easy once travelling got removed from the rule book
kgPT9_TLxEk,have the rules of basketball changed in the last clip the scorer was guilty of travelling  he took about 8 steps without bouncing the ball
kgPT9_TLxEk,how you gonna use the thumbnail of tiger chipping on on the 16th at bay hill and then not even show the video
kgPT9_TLxEk,what a bluff where is the golf shot
kgPT9_TLxEk,lucky shot is all that is in soccer
kgPT9_TLxEk,impossible is nothing
kgPT9_TLxEk,did lavine take like 10 steps before the buz beater
kgPT9_TLxEk,it is impossible to not make a travelling call at
kgPT9_TLxEk,its not impossible when you what you do all the time becomes easy without knowing
kgPT9_TLxEk,nhls goal
kgPT9_TLxEk,volleyball i thought this vid was about real sport
kgPT9_TLxEk,its curios how id seen million of times that thumbnail shot
kgPT9_TLxEk,its super
kgPT9_TLxEk,so where is tigerwoods
kgPT9_TLxEk,great vid but wheres the golf wacky shot
kgPT9_TLxEk,what a nice video
kgPT9_TLxEk,im here to see the golf thumbnail where is it
kgPT9_TLxEk,if you want to see the golf shot  in the teaser  not here  even though it is quite enjoyable  these clickbaiters wont put in the golf shot
kgPT9_TLxEk,hohum  too much basketball  edits ruined the only hockey one and the click bait is not appreciated
kgPT9_TLxEk,just another clickbait boring vid golf shot from the thumbnail isnt even included
kgPT9_TLxEk,so the thumbnail pic isnt in the video no upvote

VdLf4fihP78,has john oliver done an episode on college board if not i think he should
VdLf4fihP78,forever21 allowing midwestern tweens to look like a 40something year old alcoholic attending the wedding of a tel aviv nightclub owner
VdLf4fihP78,you should do another fast fashion episode but this time focusing on the environmental impact
VdLf4fihP78,64 clothes per year i dont know if i ever owned 64 clothes in total
VdLf4fihP78,he is genuinely good he addresses the real issues in todays society we all choose to ignore
VdLf4fihP78,eat the wagon of mystery chickens sounds like an option for punishment on a japanese quiz show after answering a question wrong
VdLf4fihP78,im sitting here sewing wornout cargo pants into a skirt
VdLf4fihP78,who else is here bingewatching old lwt episodes during quarantine
VdLf4fihP78,why do john oliver videos make you so depressed and happy with laughter at the same time
VdLf4fihP78,this is why i walk around naked the police call it indecent exposure or whatever but i call it a silent protest its also very freeing
VdLf4fihP78,but whats gaps possible excuse seriously
VdLf4fihP78,john oliver is my favorite talk show host because he actually talks about the issues that matter
VdLf4fihP78,john oliver is amazing he tackles real issues in a humorous way i just wish it was taken more seriously
VdLf4fihP78,eat this wagon of mystery chickens is not a sentence i ever thought id hear in my life
VdLf4fihP78,this man is literally making the world a better place i cant stop watching his videos
VdLf4fihP78,watched this when it first aired and since then i havent bought new clothes sweatshop clothes thanks for educating me on something i now care about a lot
VdLf4fihP78,fast fashion is so profitable because nobody has enough money for clothes theyre too busy spending their money on bills rent and food
VdLf4fihP78,looove john n his so to the point critical yet funny shows the whole world should watch n learn from them
VdLf4fihP78,i would have loved to see the reactions of each ceo when the food was delivered i bet the faces made were
VdLf4fihP78,john oliver is cable television awesomeness
VdLf4fihP78,so gaps defense is that theyre not corrupt just nearly criminally incompetent
VdLf4fihP78,johns show is the greatest one right now he has amazing material and better jokes than the other comedians and his delivery is fantastic
VdLf4fihP78,oddly enough the grocery store i work at has 5 rotisserie chickens
VdLf4fihP78,as someone who makes clothes i really appreciate this episode
VdLf4fihP78,eat this wagon of rotisserie chickens is now my new catch phrase
VdLf4fihP78,i work in the harbor and many times containers of tshirts and jeans stay unclaimed
VdLf4fihP78,i recently discovered last week tonight and im hooked delivered so perfectly
VdLf4fihP78,thank you so much for this episode its very important to keep this in our heads
VdLf4fihP78,my outfit cost 5 dollars thank you thrifting you are the green cheap alternative to child labor
VdLf4fihP78,i suppose a more depressing question is why a 14 year old needs to lie about being 18 to get a crappy job in a sweatshop 
VdLf4fihP78,i think the worst thing we heard about in all of this is common being made to rhyme in the hood with in the hood
VdLf4fihP78,why did his first joke have to be so accurate to my life
VdLf4fihP78,eat this wagon of mystery chickens
VdLf4fihP78,thats one of the best arguments to buy your clothes secondhand that i think ive ever heard learn to sew protect the environment pressure companies to stop slavery
VdLf4fihP78,the cameraman rolling his eyes behind kathie lee as she pretends to give some grandiose fascimile of a shit about workers will forever be the funniest part of this
VdLf4fihP78,this show is so funny yet so informativeits so insightful
VdLf4fihP78,nyc where a 46 lunch is considered suspiciously cheap
VdLf4fihP78,you are the man john oliver
VdLf4fihP78,i love this guy my history teacher showed us a video of his and now im bing watching his videos
VdLf4fihP78,for the last 15 years i had resorted to buying good quality 2nd hand stuff which are costly sometimes but worth it
VdLf4fihP78,are there any multibillion dollar industries that arent plagued by shoddy business practices
VdLf4fihP78,for 074 per dumpling is considered a real high price where i live we get a dumpling that is handmadedecent filling for around 016 dollars
VdLf4fihP78,this makes me feel bad for wearing clothes you know gap aint the only one that sends there labor over there
VdLf4fihP78,ilo needs to hold these companies socially accountable via fines and enforcement worldwide
VdLf4fihP78,its sad we live in a world where fashion trends are controversial
VdLf4fihP78,this is the second hardest ive ever laughed about child sweatshop labor
VdLf4fihP78,dammit i was really curious how that little girl was going to turn that cart around
VdLf4fihP78,he even mentioned the issues in bangladesh
VdLf4fihP78,its been 5 years since this video was first uploaded the fast fashion industry is still more powerful than ever
VdLf4fihP78,one of the very few shows willing to say eat this wagon of mystery chickens like they mean it
VdLf4fihP78,i own a copy of the last sears catalog from 1993 its true the vast majority of clothing was made in the usa
VdLf4fihP78,by cheapening the price of nonessential items and arguably essential items we have become wasteful people with ever decreasing salaries could our inept governments even control prices
VdLf4fihP78,all will be so happy when clothing finally comes out of fully automized factories where even the robots are repaired by other robots
VdLf4fihP78,love your show so insightful
VdLf4fihP78,are the conditions better when the clothing is more expensive should we buy those instead or is the goal just to buy less clothes
VdLf4fihP78,i got an amazing dress for 1
VdLf4fihP78,i never thought any human could talk for nearly 20 minutes and make it actually interesting
VdLf4fihP78,eat this wagon full of mystery chickens is one of the best sentences ever uttered by a human being
VdLf4fihP78,i have never fallen for the con of fashion
VdLf4fihP78,could you possibly consider doing a video about fashion focusing more on the environmental impact of fast fashion industry
VdLf4fihP78,the food analogy is a bit redundant because thats basically what fast food companies already do
VdLf4fihP78,i understand that some countries need their kids to work to help put food on the table my problem is the underpay and bad conditions

OaDV700n6Qc,i dont care what anyone thinks about my baldness because i love it
OaDV700n6Qc,deep inside jada was less hurt by chris joke than she was with seeing will laugh on it
OaDV700n6Qc,chris stood his ground like a rock
OaDV700n6Qc,if jada didnt like the joke then its hair loss
OaDV700n6Qc,imagine being hired for a job as a comedian and your job is to joke about the movie stars on stage
OaDV700n6Qc,chris being a comedy genius will one day make so many materials from this seemingly embarrassing moment from smith
OaDV700n6Qc,he acted out of impulse when he slowly and methodically walked up there he had lots of time to think about it
OaDV700n6Qc,jada i dont care what people think about me being bald
OaDV700n6Qc,what i find so damning is that jade said she doesnt care what people say about her hair lost
OaDV700n6Qc,its disgusting how when its the elite and upper classes its called  losing your temper but when its the poor and those who live in poverty its called senseless violence
OaDV700n6Qc,oddly one minute will slaps chris then after that hes crying like a baby
OaDV700n6Qc,actually will did not apologize  his people apologized to rocks people
OaDV700n6Qc,chris was merely doing his job hosting the oscars like he did in 2016
OaDV700n6Qc,i was so impressed with chris rock on how he handled it he even immediately did a joke after the slap he is true talent and class
OaDV700n6Qc,obviously she does care about what people say about her appearance
OaDV700n6Qc,just proves what it is to be a man and not getting carried away with emotions big respect to him
OaDV700n6Qc,et jada and will always had eachothers backs
OaDV700n6Qc,you know who is going through a lot right now literally everyone
OaDV700n6Qc,a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble in the neighborhood
OaDV700n6Qc,the way jada explained what happened between her and august is absolutely disgusting she laughed right in wills face
OaDV700n6Qc,will smiths hubris just cemented chris rocks place in history
OaDV700n6Qc,chris is a smart guy he immediately saw his rating skyrocket handled it the best possible way too 
OaDV700n6Qc,all the time i see in will eyes sadness hope he heals someday
OaDV700n6Qc,chris stepping up from stand up to slapstick
OaDV700n6Qc,why does chris have to press charges it was a crime an assault taking place publicly for all to see including police
OaDV700n6Qc,we have found so much happiness in our union i really yelled and august
OaDV700n6Qc,damn on the biggest stage of the entertainment industry will smith had a meltdown of epic proportions decades of carefully cultivating a wholesome image  slapped away over a dumb joke
OaDV700n6Qc,this is what you call a blessing in disguise for chris rock
OaDV700n6Qc,i have lost all respect for the oscars and will smith  that was pure violence that was condoned  young adults saw that and think its ok now
OaDV700n6Qc,if will had not attack chris no one would have remembered that joke
OaDV700n6Qc,looks like jada provoked the mood swing with her eye rolling will was laughing and enjoying it
OaDV700n6Qc,will smith slapped that comedy tour into comedy gold oh what a world we live in
OaDV700n6Qc,damn man i really feel for will his wife has teally messed him up big time  and chris just happened to be there at the wrong place wrong time
OaDV700n6Qc,this occurrence has made me love chris rock more
OaDV700n6Qc,chris rock was the only one that i seen at the oscars with any class including the audience after the standing ovation for will smith
OaDV700n6Qc,chris rock handled the situation like a super man
OaDV700n6Qc,praying will finds peace
OaDV700n6Qc,i got into one little fight and my mom got scared she said your moving to your  auntie and your uncle in bel air
OaDV700n6Qc,will smith acted out of impulse his impulse was laughter everything else was pure violence
OaDV700n6Qc,bravo  chris rock handled it like a straitup class act true man
OaDV700n6Qc,jada is the last human being to speak about healing morality and humanity when she shows the opposite of morality and family values
OaDV700n6Qc,love how chris rock is winning from this and his ticket prices have gone from 46 to 400 dollars he deserves it
OaDV700n6Qc,chris is the best  he take so well professional he didint hit back or lost hes temper or mood hes reaction was outstanding good
OaDV700n6Qc,chris rock we all say it loud you are real  an actor
OaDV700n6Qc,i like how jada laughed at the joke too and she didnt even look at will to slap him
OaDV700n6Qc,honestly im just very sad for chris
OaDV700n6Qc,i feel bad for everyone involved  i hope time heals it self like everything going on in this world
OaDV700n6Qc,im happy to see chris rock move forward with his comedy tour he definitely has taken the high road i have always believed that success is you best revenge
OaDV700n6Qc,chris rock really do have an incredible temper control system not to have retaliated a slap from a fellow black dude i respect chris
OaDV700n6Qc,he didnt just slap he even shouted during the ceremony and nobody stand up against this as jim carey said hollywood is spineless
OaDV700n6Qc,fact ws shouldve had the courage not to laugh at something he thought was cruel enough to slap someone on live broadcast for
OaDV700n6Qc,i truly hope this pass and they heal and forgive each other
OaDV700n6Qc,love you chrisyou made will look like a fool when you stood like the man you are
OaDV700n6Qc,will smith could keep the oscars of shame and disgrace and every time he sees it should remember what he did
OaDV700n6Qc,being compared to gi jane  a bad ass female marine who shaves her head as a symbol of empowerment is actually a better compliment than jada open relationship pinkettsmith deserves
OaDV700n6Qc,ricky gervais said it best
OaDV700n6Qc,i love jadas prefiller face
OaDV700n6Qc,ive always loved chris
OaDV700n6Qc,et touches this touchy subject with respect to all parties involved
OaDV700n6Qc,usually when a victim doesnt want to press charges the state will
OaDV700n6Qc,if it wasnt for chriss coolness and his respect to the academy and for the audience things could have escalated
OaDV700n6Qc,so now we know when will smith laughs or smiles at anyone he really is 0 seconds from whooping your ass
OaDV700n6Qc,happy for chris i am
OaDV700n6Qc,when you put yourself on display
OaDV700n6Qc,chris rock during this situation irl has shown that hes at whole different level of intellectual and emotional security like hes just a more evolved human

8roqqqaxW7c,antony starr is an a class actor you cant be not terrified by the character he is playing
8roqqqaxW7c,give antony starr an emmyhe scares the shit out of me as homelander
8roqqqaxW7c,antony starr and karl urban both deserve a fucking emmy award for their outstanding performances as homelander and billy butcher
8roqqqaxW7c,love how much have they have been marketing s3 theyre really confident on it which makes me very excited for what  more will come
8roqqqaxW7c,it is fun to see starr as he normally looks he is a cool guy you can tell he takes it all with a grain of salt
8roqqqaxW7c,karen actually
8roqqqaxW7c,anthony starr was born to play homelander on the same level with rdj and iron man i cant wait for the rest of the season
8roqqqaxW7c,im stoked both antony and karl still have their new zealand accents in real life
8roqqqaxW7c,does anybody feel like erin moriarty looks a lot more different than she did in season 1
8roqqqaxW7c,this cast deserves all the praise
8roqqqaxW7c,we dont deserve this show its too good
8roqqqaxW7c,i love anthony starr so fucking muchhe deserves a goddamn emmy
8roqqqaxW7c,anthony starr is absolutely phenomenal
8roqqqaxW7c,i really didnt think the butcherhomelander scene actually happened but the way antony talks about it makes it seem like he was actually there thoughts
8roqqqaxW7c,anthony deserves an emmy for playing homelander
8roqqqaxW7c,that character analysis of butcher by the man himself is very accurate and often overlooked
8roqqqaxW7c,i like that as absurd as it seems amazon still has a line that they cant cross probably because it leans into corn territory
8roqqqaxW7c,if antony wont won emmy or golden globe it would be outrageous
8roqqqaxW7c,i feel like they should have billy zane as every character portrayal cameo since theyve already done it twice
8roqqqaxW7c,aya is so much fun i hope that do a stormfront x soldier boy episode in diabolical
8roqqqaxW7c,ok that makes more sense i was wondering how they got charlize theron to go up to toronto for a cameo if there was a 2 week quarantine period
8roqqqaxW7c,antony starr is fucking intimidating i look at him into his eyes and see a pair of red glowing eyes ready to burn me down to ashes
8roqqqaxW7c,erin doesnt look at all like herself anymore
8roqqqaxW7c,i hope erin and karl are okay gosh they look a bit exhausted
8roqqqaxW7c,i feel like every time i see starr hes adopted a new thing to differentiate his appearance from homelander  hair colour glasses beard what next
8roqqqaxW7c,im happy eric kripke stuck w the underdog idea and not making the boys full blown superheroes
8roqqqaxW7c,clark kent wolverine reverse flash you name it and antony is perfect for the role
8roqqqaxW7c,wait a minute i thought when homelander showed up at butchers home it was a dream sequence so did he actually do it
8roqqqaxW7c,anthony starr would make an awesome wolverine just saying
8roqqqaxW7c,homelander be lookin like logan here majestic
8roqqqaxW7c,butcher does seem too be the only one who is understanding the situation
8roqqqaxW7c,thank goodness kimiko and starlight are american actresses all these aussies are taking our superhero jobs
8roqqqaxW7c,is anthony the new wolverine awesome
8roqqqaxW7c,good to see another shortland street boy do well

8roqqqaxW7c,is anthony starr preparing to play wolverine
8roqqqaxW7c,isnt he a perfect cast for wolverine
8roqqqaxW7c,karl urban as butcher is just chefs kiss
8roqqqaxW7c,wowwstarr will could be a great wolverine
8roqqqaxW7c,what has erin moriarty done to her face
8roqqqaxW7c,butcher was talking about star light when he said  give the kid a cheese burger once in a while
8roqqqaxW7c,bendiciones hermosa celina que dios te cuidem donde quiera que
8roqqqaxW7c,his facial hair makes him look more like wolverine
8roqqqaxW7c,if homelander ever wanted to stop being homelander he just needs to look like his actor and no one would recognize him
8roqqqaxW7c,i get doing what you want with your money but man i did not need to know that was a practical set used in the termite scene
8roqqqaxW7c,lmfao his beard really makes him becomes wolverine
8roqqqaxW7c,homelander looks far less menacing in real life
8roqqqaxW7c,anthony starr becomes a nice clark kent with glasses on
8roqqqaxW7c,still love dredd
8roqqqaxW7c,i need to go check out the xray to see the extended scene with charlize
8roqqqaxW7c,strange karls natural voice sounds more british than his voice as billy who is a brit
8roqqqaxW7c,didnt he just say he never saw her next erin is babbling on about anthony being there with charlize 
8roqqqaxW7c,is he auditioning for wolverine
8roqqqaxW7c,karl urbans cockney accent is objectively terrible dick van dyke level but im fine with it now
8roqqqaxW7c,what the hell erin moriarty did to her face
8roqqqaxW7c,is this how wolverine gonna be leaked into mcu  both butcher and homelander can do awesome wolverine
8roqqqaxW7c,karen has a cool voice but we never get to hear her
8roqqqaxW7c,anthony looks like wolverine and karl looks like sabretooth there mcu can use them for future xmen project lol
8roqqqaxW7c,antony starr as loganwolverine
8roqqqaxW7c,he looks like a mcu version of wolverine
8roqqqaxW7c,starlight has a southern accent
8roqqqaxW7c,im pretty sure karl urban and karen fukuhara are a thing
8roqqqaxW7c,think theron has been used by weird stuff from hanging with macfarlane and doing his weird shows
8roqqqaxW7c,i saw wolverine right there for a moment
8roqqqaxW7c,starlight is sooo gorgeous
8roqqqaxW7c,erins new face was distracting she looked way better before
8roqqqaxW7c,looks like homelanders turning into wolverine
8roqqqaxW7c,anthony starr got that wolverine facial hair
8roqqqaxW7c,antony starr will be rumored to play as mcu wolverine
8roqqqaxW7c,loved the cameo
8roqqqaxW7c,wait wait wait  butcher forgot to get off character
8roqqqaxW7c,what the hell did starlight do to her face she was beautiful
8roqqqaxW7c,why does antony starr look like wolverine with glasses
8roqqqaxW7c,why does anthony star look like wolverine with all that facial hair
8roqqqaxW7c,man i am medical student  but idkw i like homelander way of releve stress
8roqqqaxW7c,so how did euphoria get away with showing so many erect phalluses
8roqqqaxW7c,imo karl urban can be wolverinemy opinion only nothing else
8roqqqaxW7c,anthony star looks like wolverine
8roqqqaxW7c,homelander can be wolverine in marvels
8roqqqaxW7c,claudia is cool
8roqqqaxW7c,i am a normal guy i am afraid of him
8roqqqaxW7c,starr is unrecognizable here
8roqqqaxW7c,i didnt do anything to gunpowder
8roqqqaxW7c,this is a wolverine audition
8roqqqaxW7c,thats homelander hes so different
8roqqqaxW7c,anthony starr wolverine

T-JVpKku5SI,agreeing with you
T-JVpKku5SI,this is soo true
T-JVpKku5SI,great piece tom this issue needs more attention in the media
T-JVpKku5SI,the consciousness of any society can only be established through the mother tongue
T-JVpKku5SI,this issue needs more attention from everyone very nice work done by the cnbc team to highlight this issue in your report
T-JVpKku5SI,everything has a price
T-JVpKku5SI,a voice from cambodia 
T-JVpKku5SI,in my opinion the most important thing which determines the educational performance of the child is whether hisher parents value education or not everything else is secondary
T-JVpKku5SI,without solving social and economic inequality  we cannot solve education inequality we are suffering but government wants to  keep education more expensive to some handful of rich family
T-JVpKku5SI,if you wanna research about the real inequality in education you should visit india
T-JVpKku5SI,i hope digital education is more developed to fill the inequality gap of education
T-JVpKku5SI,india has changed its education system nowi am quite hopeful about it
T-JVpKku5SI,schools will naturally exacerbate inequities because those that are fast learners high g will accelerate away from the low g students
T-JVpKku5SI,hey cnbc please make a video on indian students facing problems in this pandemic
T-JVpKku5SI,i can always tell that these videos are super credible because of the handheld camera work and the distracting and completely unnecessary zooms
T-JVpKku5SI,there will never be equality in education or wealth thats what makes us all get up and work hard we want to be at the top
T-JVpKku5SI,india has a simple system deny college seats and government jobs to those considered privileged irrespective of their test scores
T-JVpKku5SI,a system not based on the reality of life is not educationits a program
T-JVpKku5SI,here in india education is  a business the more money u have the better education youll have which very obvious leads to inequality
T-JVpKku5SI,malcolm gladwell has also explained it in his book outliers
T-JVpKku5SI,in taiwan or other northeast countries most resource are on the public schools  rather than the privates
T-JVpKku5SI,im from a country where university and college intakes for students are based on our races the privileged always have the upper hand
T-JVpKku5SI,indian government is forcing around 3 million students to sit in entrance exams
T-JVpKku5SI,money makes money not the education but right contacts what you get near right people sad or not but little some can do about it
T-JVpKku5SI,education is the foundation of success
T-JVpKku5SI,this triggers me no end
T-JVpKku5SI,my education didnt affect me in any positive way i just wasted my time but im successful anyway because i was selfeducating anybody can self educate these days
T-JVpKku5SI,from the materialistic view there is no such a fair in life
T-JVpKku5SI,private education is the route of inequalityim entirely agree with this statement
T-JVpKku5SI,some countries are sexist and its hard for females to have access to good education 
T-JVpKku5SI,the parents play a big role in their kids learning
T-JVpKku5SI,sounds beautiful but how could we achieve it
T-JVpKku5SI,the avydelall roundersindividuals with unique talents
T-JVpKku5SI,as long as privatization existsthere is always going to be inequality
T-JVpKku5SI,totally agree
T-JVpKku5SI,if you really want educational equallity or equity you should live in a socialism countries arguing about the equallity in the free competitive market where we are living is absurd
T-JVpKku5SI,i went to public school free in the uk and they give you all the resources you need anyone can achieve the best
T-JVpKku5SI,so benefits
T-JVpKku5SI,top chalk  best channel for education  info
T-JVpKku5SI,your postcode should never determine your life chances
T-JVpKku5SI,for me this video was prefaced by an advert for harrow school online
T-JVpKku5SI,philippines is struggling
T-JVpKku5SI,chido el video

MutyT341KUo,valdez is freaking me out with how good hes been this season especially lately hes like a wizard at working himself out of jams and a literal groundball machine otherwise
MutyT341KUo,im just amazed year after year the astros are a powerhouse and consistent both sides
MutyT341KUo,framber continues to absolutely dominate
MutyT341KUo,kyle tucker is such a great player but is being overshadowed bc alvarez is such a beast
MutyT341KUo,damn the way the astros passed through the mets i have no words man valdez is really special
MutyT341KUo,astros looking good tonight they are always very consistent
MutyT341KUo,the astros organization are doing a fantastic job on developing players as much of you hate em they are the real deal
MutyT341KUo,astros have to be the best team in the al right now yankees got handled by them and got lucky
MutyT341KUo,what a game offense was rolling and framber pitched his 12th consecutive quality start great game stros
MutyT341KUo,im a diehard yankees fan but im nervous that the astros are the team to beat again
MutyT341KUo,for those who didnt know framber valdez has a groundball rate of 67 for context second place is only 56
MutyT341KUo,like ive been saying all season hou is a problem for any team nym will be fine no doubt kudos on the win
MutyT341KUo,good game stros good recovery from the last game with the yankees
MutyT341KUo,if your team plays ours your gonna definitely get to know the names king tuck air jordan  la pina
MutyT341KUo,its getting to easy for the astros
MutyT341KUo,lets go astros space city is leveling up in 2022
MutyT341KUo,astros have been owning the new york teams
MutyT341KUo,tucker is having such a great season i love it
MutyT341KUo,if valdez can cut down a little more on the walks he can easily be a top 1015 every year bc hes hard to hit off with his stuff
MutyT341KUo,hes going back hes at the wall hes looking up hasta luego
MutyT341KUo,im just amazed year after year the astros are a powerhouse and consistent
MutyT341KUo,tucker has some big time biggio energy  ive seen people take a week off for jamming their finger half as bad as he did on that stolen base  beast
MutyT341KUo,i use to think the yankees were the best team in baseball  but the astros been proving my thought wrong
MutyT341KUo,the astros really arent missing correa that much cause that kid pena is the truth
MutyT341KUo,kyle tucker is having a great season and nobody is talking about it
MutyT341KUo,as a braves fan thank you astros for taking it to the mets d
MutyT341KUo,excellent ds kudos astros
MutyT341KUo,damn astros dominated best teams in baseball with best records yankees and mets
MutyT341KUo,thank you astros braves country appreciates you mets starting to fall into their old ways
MutyT341KUo,framber had the bases loaded in the 4th and he looked as calm as can be
MutyT341KUo,the houston astros are 4627
MutyT341KUo,curaao got shelled in houston with 4 runs in the first inning oh the foreshadow
MutyT341KUo,the astros are stingy and excellent
MutyT341KUo,altuve taking advantage of the overpowered dive animations in the show this year
MutyT341KUo,just give the trophy  to the astros nobody has a chance
MutyT341KUo,valdez got nasty stuff for the astrosgo  stros
MutyT341KUo,great start by valdez lets sweep em then beat the yankees go astros
MutyT341KUo,marte 3 hits in a 99 shutoutand davisk dpexciting players
MutyT341KUo,astros own both new york teams
MutyT341KUo,mets fans were cheering so much after they scored that one run on a bases loaded walk how cute
MutyT341KUo,if only it was a shutout win in queens tonight to go along with the no hitter in the bronx last week
MutyT341KUo,can frambo be a number 1 i think so if he can keep this up this is a breakout season so far
MutyT341KUo,framber is so freaking good gotdang
MutyT341KUo,sigh mets now they face verlander tomorrow 
MutyT341KUo,another single digits for the astros wins against the mets
MutyT341KUo,way to go astros
MutyT341KUo,i feel the mets will start sinking nowespecially with mccann back in the lineuphes an automatic out that the mets cant afford release him
MutyT341KUo,astros in contest to be the best in the game with the yanks
MutyT341KUo,maybe the mets should just skip playing the astros from now on
MutyT341KUo,alveraz had more hits vs the mets last night than entire world series combined last year vs the braves
MutyT341KUo,mccann continues to depress mets fans pitching thanks to all the injuries needs help fast lgm
MutyT341KUo,sometimes i wonder how many first base umpires got it  wrong but were never discovered as making that error well never really know
MutyT341KUo,lets go astros it was my birthday yesterday
MutyT341KUo,houston might as well be collecting rent up there cause they own new york
MutyT341KUo,look at this little foreshadowing
MutyT341KUo,if the mets played the astros in the ws this year theyd be toast
MutyT341KUo,i miss degrom so much
MutyT341KUo,in the city of queens the king has showed up
MutyT341KUo,astros are the mets daddy
MutyT341KUo,the celebrating of a walk in run was sad
MutyT341KUo,unbelievably parades is still on the roasters
MutyT341KUo,carasco is actually blaming the leadoff walk of altuve for the whole game  he said it was a blown call and  it changed the whole game
MutyT341KUo,astros was all business today
MutyT341KUo,james mccann average is 179 and martin maldonado is average 144 these are supposed to be elite teams but catching in mlb is really bad
MutyT341KUo,poor buck showalterhas a great team to manage this yearbut they are just not good enough to beat the houston astros lol
MutyT341KUo,myers started the engine
MutyT341KUo,man are the mets fans booing their team thats rough
MutyT341KUo,go stros
MutyT341KUo,well i guess i might as well just stay with the pin stripes across the borough cause these mets aint going nowhere  the tease is over
MutyT341KUo,if youre a mets fan ouch
MutyT341KUo,mets are weak when playing a good team 
MutyT341KUo,need another bat jd davis aint gonna cut it
MutyT341KUo,carrasco has been too erratic shreve needs to go
MutyT341KUo,mets won win the ws
MutyT341KUo,if your a mets fan youre wasting your timethe mets are jinx and blow every game
MutyT341KUo,i cant seem to find any info why as altuve lifted from the game
MutyT341KUo,astros aka kings of new york

4UXyPKCM7uI,one of the most heartbreaking moments ive ever seen as a liverpool fan
4UXyPKCM7uI,the goal against bayern that back heel top corner against city  what a legend happy hunting sadio well miss you ynwa
4UXyPKCM7uI,not a liverpool fan i wont miss him terrorising my team anymore newcastle but will miss watching him terrorise everyone elses great player
4UXyPKCM7uI,they bought him six years ago from southampton and he was 24 come on sky you shouldnt be making amateur mistakes like this
4UXyPKCM7uI,what a brilliant human being you deserve to be treat as a king mane well miss you for sure good luck
4UXyPKCM7uI,sadio mane is my hero a brilliant footballer and an even better human being incredibly generous  humble wishing him all the best at bayern
4UXyPKCM7uI,so sad to see him go hes been such an important player for liverpool one of klopps first big signings he will be missed
4UXyPKCM7uI,bayern did well to get him so cheap but im sure they were pointing to the thiago deal saying we did you a favour time to repay it
4UXyPKCM7uI,when you think about it this is the first time in a long time when a huge player has left liverpool on very respectful terms with the fans
4UXyPKCM7uI,i love liverpools transfer strategy so simple but so effective  well researched transfers that get done early and a clear vision of how they want their teams built
4UXyPKCM7uI,im gonna miss sadio mane hell always be a liverpool legend in my heart
4UXyPKCM7uI,its an evolution sooner or later our legend front three will end their journey but in klopp we trust we need mane walk of honour to his departure
4UXyPKCM7uI,great career won it all legend all the best to him
4UXyPKCM7uI,bayern have got an absolute bargain there
4UXyPKCM7uI,end of an era
4UXyPKCM7uI,gonna miss seeing him in a liverpool kit thank you legend
4UXyPKCM7uI,the end of sfmfor 5 years this trio was the best in eplthank you sadiowe will miss you
4UXyPKCM7uI,sadio was the first major signing for klopp its really hard to swallow that hes leaving by far one of the best player in the klopp era ynwa
4UXyPKCM7uI,a sad day indeed he will be missed
4UXyPKCM7uI,sadio mane will go down as a true legend humble down to earth and an exceptional talent

wBEAjjioZFI,mats theories and findings are so amazing that sometimes i wonder if he is a human or a robot
wBEAjjioZFI,ive never played a single game in this series between matpat and markiplier i know every detail
wBEAjjioZFI,dont you think its weird how gregory hesitated to tell freddy his name he responded to freddy like he made it up on the spot
wBEAjjioZFI,something else to remember matt is that one two three were the last words the crying child ever heard before the bite
wBEAjjioZFI,no one else is as dedicated to this lore as mat he is the king of fnaf truly
wBEAjjioZFI,he has solved almost every thing when it comes to fnaf except for the timeline ill wait
wBEAjjioZFI,just keep in mind that when scott hands the company over the lore is most likely going to continue and itll be different
wBEAjjioZFI,there were recently a lot of fixes in a patch dropped on feb 28
wBEAjjioZFI,i think something else to add to his theory is that gregory never reacted when he walked in this room hes not shy about talking to himself or freddy
wBEAjjioZFI,matt today well finally solve fnaf
wBEAjjioZFI,gregory being the crying child in robot form makes sense however gregory also being patient 46 doesnt add up imo
wBEAjjioZFI,we definetly need an updated timeline 
wBEAjjioZFI,its always funny whenever matpat says we solve fnaf
wBEAjjioZFI,what if security breach is the collection of all the surviving versions of the afton family what if there are multiples of each like charlies robots in the book series
wBEAjjioZFI,if matpat does a advert i will always want to buy whatever it is
wBEAjjioZFI,this is the final fnaf theory
wBEAjjioZFI,i have a theory
wBEAjjioZFI,when he solves fnaf he should seriously make a video covering everythingthe entire timeline
wBEAjjioZFI,every game has lore for this guy even some happy ones
wBEAjjioZFI,the day this lore gets solved mats gonna get awarded exotic butters
wBEAjjioZFI,honestly i think the simplest answers are the best answers and its best not to look to deep into it
wBEAjjioZFI,i really think you should make an hour long video just taking it all from the beginning and actually ending it somewhere
wBEAjjioZFI,i love watching your videos and i think you are awesome at these theories
wBEAjjioZFI,the lore has become so complicated by now that i feel like i need a recap video of everything we know so far about this franchise haha
wBEAjjioZFI,mat a third therapist bites the dust
wBEAjjioZFI,just a question  what if you just cut the jacket in pieces for the price
wBEAjjioZFI,how to debunk matpats theory where did gregory get the money to see so many therapists
wBEAjjioZFI,that feel when the musical intro is scarier than the entire game
wBEAjjioZFI,this man has the ability of plot finder
wBEAjjioZFI,i wonder if scott ever watches his videos and is like nooooo hes figuring out the fnaf lore 
wBEAjjioZFI,matpat were solving fnaf once and for all wait didnt we say the same thing seven years ago
wBEAjjioZFI,i am literally obsessed with this
wBEAjjioZFI,matpat in 2015 today we solve fnaf
wBEAjjioZFI,i think your theory about gregory being the patient is correct as one of the notes bearly read out therapy the therapy given to the patient in the recordings
wBEAjjioZFI,i mean it makes sense why gregory is so brave despite being hunted for sport hed have already experienced the worst fate death
wBEAjjioZFI,we need an entire book of the lore
wBEAjjioZFI,honestly no matter how many times matpat makes a fnaf theory i would still watch them
wBEAjjioZFI,dont look behind you thanks for the chills down my spine in my empty apartment at 10pm 
wBEAjjioZFI,thanks matpatt thanks to you and your playlist of fnaf videos i used a pickup line on a girl she ended up being the girl of my dreams thanks matt
wBEAjjioZFI,it always feels like christmas morning when matpat makes a new fnaf theory
wBEAjjioZFI,lmao it said dont look behind you i looked behind me after hesitating and when i turned around it was back to normal well played
wBEAjjioZFI,hey mat hot take what if evan turned out just like dear david
wBEAjjioZFI,imagine vanessa was going to let gregory live with her so he wasnt homeless anymore
wBEAjjioZFI,i like to think matpat has an entire room dedicated to the fnaf lore and theory crafting
wBEAjjioZFI,matt theres no evidence that vanny sees herself as a child
wBEAjjioZFI,i still cant believe ive been watching game theory for nearly a decade
wBEAjjioZFI,i can imagine scott using these theories to make the story even more complex so as matpat makes more videos the lore just expands endlessly
wBEAjjioZFI,bro your theories make me so interested sometimes i forget what i was doing while watching the video pls make more fnaf theories
wBEAjjioZFI,i honestly think were gonna get a new theory this week bc of the new dlc page happy about it though
wBEAjjioZFI,with the new dlc teaser and the new character they could be the one pulling the strings idk much though lol
wBEAjjioZFI,i recommend to go over everything and think about things that you might have left out 
wBEAjjioZFI,matpat this game just keeps pulling you back doesnt it
wBEAjjioZFI,this is my final fnaf theory
wBEAjjioZFI,i really  like gregory as the animatronic crying child and 46 he fits close enough but the option for 46 to be a new antagonist is also exciting
wBEAjjioZFI,guess we have to do this again in 7 years
wBEAjjioZFI,mat be like 2022 omg today we solved fnaf
wBEAjjioZFI,i love your videos btw
SnWuiAxgNx4,being a manchester united fan is like loving someone who keeps letting you down
SnWuiAxgNx4,respect to christian basing his decision on footballing reasons and not just big money especially considering that his heading into the latter stages of his career
SnWuiAxgNx4,this used to be an easy decision back in the day obviously brentford would have won now were on par with them how the mighty brentford have fallen
SnWuiAxgNx4,he will sign for brentford united are a team that needs massive rebuild and erikson might not want to have anything to do with that also family comes first
SnWuiAxgNx4,how far has man utd fallen deciding between man utd and brentford
SnWuiAxgNx4,this is not about how big the club is brentford offered eriksen a way back into top flight football after nearly dying
SnWuiAxgNx4,im incredibly surprised that spurs dont want him he would be perfect for their midfield creativity issues but only if conte wants to play a 352 or a 3412
SnWuiAxgNx4,wherever he goes i wish him the best class player and ngl i miss him at spurs
SnWuiAxgNx4,i really hope he comes to utd  but at the same time id understand him staying at brentford
SnWuiAxgNx4,i hope he signs for brentford united board will mistreat him coming from a united fan
SnWuiAxgNx4,would have liked him at newcastle hope he stays at brentford but wish the lad all the best wot ever he decides
SnWuiAxgNx4,one player who everyone is behind no matter what team they support and i think we all want him to stay clear of man utd for that reason
SnWuiAxgNx4,i would love to see the lad go back to brentford they did him a solid he will start every game
SnWuiAxgNx4,if he chooses united then hes just made the biggest mistake in his career to much pressure and toxicity at united
SnWuiAxgNx4,my club is battling it out with brentford
SnWuiAxgNx4,god didnt give him a second chance for him to choose utd
SnWuiAxgNx4,he should remain at brentford for his own good
SnWuiAxgNx4,im a utd fan
SnWuiAxgNx4,as a dane and united fan im really proud of eriksen and what he has done for danish football in general
SnWuiAxgNx4,hes going to stay at brentford and in some ways im pleased he stayed loyal but in other ways im gutted we couldnt get him
SnWuiAxgNx4,did he have to say erikesen was the heartbeat of brentford midfield
SnWuiAxgNx4,he knows the right decision and he knows which will get him a lot of money
SnWuiAxgNx4,he is gonna say something within a week he has promised thomas frank an answer
SnWuiAxgNx4,i really hope he stays at brentford as i think it could turn nasty up north
SnWuiAxgNx4,as a united fan i would love to see him at united under ten hag though its a hard decission to make
SnWuiAxgNx4,brentford to united will be a big mistake
SnWuiAxgNx4,brentford should buy bergwyne too from spurs thatll be a great double signing
SnWuiAxgNx4,i think manchester united need the wise old head in the midfield so he would be a good signing
SnWuiAxgNx4,we live in a time when players actually have to think about whether to join united or brentford
SnWuiAxgNx4,neither a brentford or man utd fan but personally id like to see eriksen stay at brentford
SnWuiAxgNx4,how far have we fallen that eirksen  is choosing between us and brentford 
SnWuiAxgNx4,like what the great ted lasso said its the hope that kills you us united fans know that feeling too well
SnWuiAxgNx4,he will be very well loved by united fans would love him here could be the difference of winning the europa league and not
SnWuiAxgNx4,should show some loyalty to the only club who gave him a lifeline
SnWuiAxgNx4,brentford took a chance when nobody else would he needs to show loyalty to the club and the manager
SnWuiAxgNx4,a heart beat of that midfield something about that comment didnt sit right with me
SnWuiAxgNx4,such a hard decision to make between a club with a quality manager that may now start to go places with good resources
SnWuiAxgNx4,ive always said ericsson is underrated he would be a great signing for united and make the midfield stronger
SnWuiAxgNx4,this title is amazing lmao how united have fallen
SnWuiAxgNx4,never thought i see the day utd would be on the same conversation line with that of a newly promoted pl teamdeservedly so tho which makes it even more sad
SnWuiAxgNx4,hed be a second or possibly third choice number 10 at united whereas hes arguably the main man at brentford tough choice for anyone really
SnWuiAxgNx4,the fact he even need to consider tell you how man utd has been over these years we use to have the best player in the epl but now
SnWuiAxgNx4,i wouldnt leave the club that gave me a shot at a come back
SnWuiAxgNx4,imagine a player need to think if he needs to join united or brenford
SnWuiAxgNx4,a sign of the times when a player is choosing between brentford and man u   10 years ago it would of been a no brainer 
SnWuiAxgNx4,dividends being taken isnt something that happens at football clubs man utd is the only club in the league whos owners take regular dividends
SnWuiAxgNx4,shows how much man utd have fallen if a player is genuinely considering choosing brentford over utd
SnWuiAxgNx4,the man should go to brentford a solid club good owners dont take crap from players great fans
SnWuiAxgNx4,this title convays in one sentence just how far weve fallen like we really fighting a brentford for a player
SnWuiAxgNx4,he would get into the man utd team and it might be his last chance at a big clubhes obviously gonna pick man utd
SnWuiAxgNx4,imagine bruno de jong  eriksen playing together
SnWuiAxgNx4,imagine telling someone 10 years ago that this would be a hard decision
SnWuiAxgNx4,the 10 percent respect spurs fans have for his loyalty and respect to the club hangs on this decision
SnWuiAxgNx4,id choose brentford and im a united fan
SnWuiAxgNx4,he owes brentford some recognition for the chance all other clubs wouldnt of given him
SnWuiAxgNx4,if i were him i would choose the bigger club who are going to have more success yes i would definitely choose brentford 
SnWuiAxgNx4,hes a instant clubhero when he stays
SnWuiAxgNx4,stay at brentford would be such a great story
SnWuiAxgNx4,shows you exactly how far utd have fallen im sure hell eventually choose utd though
SnWuiAxgNx4,where ever he goes out of the 2 he will be the best player at the club so it doesnt really matter
SnWuiAxgNx4,man utd have 8 midfielders de jong eriksen bruno van de beek fred mctominay garner mejbri solid midfield depth
SnWuiAxgNx4,his family might want to stay in london so thats a consideration
SnWuiAxgNx4,would love him at united

SWPqH3-DnrI,i appreciate stanton hitting against the astros we are going to need you in october
SWPqH3-DnrI,astros are our biggest threat getting into the ws  we need to get another good sp this deadline
SWPqH3-DnrI,great series lets go yanks
SWPqH3-DnrI,astros pen gave up 9 runs i n 9 innings during seriestheir starters are literally unhittable though
SWPqH3-DnrI,they are far and away the two best teams in the al right now

SWPqH3-DnrI,not today what a way to kick astros butts
SWPqH3-DnrI,i wanted to hear the astros announcer on the judge call wanted to hear that pain hahaha
SWPqH3-DnrI,at the conclusion of this series
SWPqH3-DnrI,its pretty clear if these two teams meet that this will be the best matchup for then entire playoffs including the world series
SWPqH3-DnrI,as a yankee fan happy with the win but seriously disappointed in this teams inability to hit the astros starters 4 runs in 4 games against the starters is pathetic
SWPqH3-DnrI,uffffff we couldnt let this astros get away with another win dj and the judge go bronx bombers
SWPqH3-DnrI,its all good awesome series the yanks need to walk off games and go to overtime to beat us
SWPqH3-DnrI,so if these teams face each other in a alcs or alds the nyy have to contain altuve by whatever means necessary
SWPqH3-DnrI,dusty really just blew a sweep
SWPqH3-DnrI,alcs preview
SWPqH3-DnrI,life is not about finding yourself life is about creating yourself lolly daskal

9vD0BYBh5c4,it certainly opened my eyes in to exactly what my children are being taught
9vD0BYBh5c4,technology companies should take more responsibility and civil servants should disappear
9vD0BYBh5c4,funny how it took a pandemic to make isaac asimovs 1980s vision about education to be a reality
9vD0BYBh5c4,children dont just need an education they need to interact with one another to build social skills
9vD0BYBh5c4,technology can provide education but school isnt about just education its about making friends learning real skills which will be helpful in life
9vD0BYBh5c4,i love this create a problem sell the solution approach we done bill
9vD0BYBh5c4,i love online learning and not like physical learning
9vD0BYBh5c4,education should be about encouraging moderation generally in our human mentality it will strategically cover the lost economic ground due to natural disasters regularly occurring on earth
9vD0BYBh5c4,its pretty big problem change the real school for a computer this can be the solution for covid times but not for all
9vD0BYBh5c4,edtech is so important in this situation also we need to consider how teacher deal with this instrument into their education
9vD0BYBh5c4,it looks great at first sight but it could become worst because it will isolate people more
9vD0BYBh5c4,the more control over what when and how you learn the education sector has the worse off students are going to be
9vD0BYBh5c4,oh please this isnt going to revolutionize learning no tech is probably ever gonna do that look to finland for how to build a great education system
9vD0BYBh5c4,sparks up so much innovated ideas of new ways of learning for the future generations
9vD0BYBh5c4,exactly like japanese railgun
9vD0BYBh5c4,as a student in the public school system id rather drop out than do online school again
9vD0BYBh5c4,covid19 was spreading around the pittsburgh pa area as early as november of 2019
9vD0BYBh5c4,yes thank you economist but george orwell and even dwight eisenhower already told us about this  as a warning
9vD0BYBh5c4,america has schools you learn something new everyday
9vD0BYBh5c4,personally i still perfer physical books to the elearning
9vD0BYBh5c4,online school has been the worst thing to happen to my educataion everything became 10x harder
9vD0BYBh5c4,not mine ill be keeping anything tech to a minimum  i prefer reality to virtual reality
9vD0BYBh5c4,computers hinder learning writing down things is essential for not only student but also teacher to affirm that the child has you know learned something
9vD0BYBh5c4,asimov wrote about this with his vision culminating in i robot the book not the movie
9vD0BYBh5c4,i dont know who but someone actually needs to hear this youve got to stop saving all your money venture into investing some if you really want financial stability
9vD0BYBh5c4,the economist is a journal that speaks for british billionaires
9vD0BYBh5c4,how tech will ruin ur kids mental health social skills and real life experiences
9vD0BYBh5c4,a lot has come from this disruption  how convenient
9vD0BYBh5c4,school also teaches social interaction you cant learn that online the rowdy teens and youngsters etc are proving this
9vD0BYBh5c4,edtech is healthy until and unless it doesnt replace the teachers itself
9vD0BYBh5c4,i hope edtech really grows this is exciting
9vD0BYBh5c4,how about we get some passionate teachers that are supported and well compensated like why are we encouraging kids to stare at screens and let their brains shrink
9vD0BYBh5c4,its time for education to catch up with reality and ditch things like a black board and realise that the subjects and teaching styles of the past are out dated
9vD0BYBh5c4,after decades of tech companies trying to do education the pandemic put the nail in the coffin for how bad it is
9vD0BYBh5c4,this is awful for childrens social development and is dehumanizing half the point of school was to socialize and make friends
9vD0BYBh5c4,i was a teacher and i decided to end my career when they decided to go online
9vD0BYBh5c4,tear the kids away from family influence asap currently three years old in scotland utter cruelty and ensures deep mk
9vD0BYBh5c4,making it nonexistent
9vD0BYBh5c4,ah the education system the beginning of the end for our children
9vD0BYBh5c4,nice video
9vD0BYBh5c4,never under estimate in person learning or our future will grow up with no social skills some teachers trying to get out doing what theyre paid to do
9vD0BYBh5c4,interesting to this topic
9vD0BYBh5c4,education or indoctrination  time to home school
9vD0BYBh5c4,thanks you
9vD0BYBh5c4,ai tech intends to make human learning superfluous
9vD0BYBh5c4,yay now we have another thing thats going to make us even more richer than before  said the 1
9vD0BYBh5c4,im your host jason palmer from economist this is intelligence
9vD0BYBh5c4,valuable data to build valuable slaves long and short of it
9vD0BYBh5c4,im so afraid in the future robot will replace human to teach small humans frightening
9vD0BYBh5c4,they shut down schools during polio outbreaks  sorry
9vD0BYBh5c4,this is the worst kind of education for the young they need interaction not to be isolated in front of a screen
9vD0BYBh5c4,who exactly owns the economist  oh i see connect the dots
9vD0BYBh5c4,is this an ai narrator
9vD0BYBh5c4,on the cusp of technologically driven slavery we are being asked to celebrate the forgemasters of our chains i dont think so
9vD0BYBh5c4,am investing my time and money in crypto now this new price is a clear sign for new investors to come in
9vD0BYBh5c4,a very very sad future awaits the children of today
9vD0BYBh5c4,oh all the antitech sentiment in the comments i totally understand the emotions but the world would just move forward regardless of peoples emotions

6oIlGhTgaKo,linus is such a nice guy its amazing how many things i giveaway without knowing it
6oIlGhTgaKo,the gpu shortage will stop once linuss whole staff has been supplied with rtx 3080s
6oIlGhTgaKo,i love how much money intel has sponsored linus for and how he still remains unbiased on how shit they currently are
6oIlGhTgaKo,i love how linus comes into other peoples homes and they have to wear the mask
6oIlGhTgaKo,at msrp this is part of the 5000 upgrade
6oIlGhTgaKo,im starting to think linus just has these types of episodes so he can inspect his employees homes and see if they stole anything
6oIlGhTgaKo,this is definitely one of the coolest ones yet chase is definitely a dedicated gamer those wall arts are really cool
6oIlGhTgaKo,you need to have chase on ltt for real  or short circuit  hes really chill and seems like a pretty decent host
6oIlGhTgaKo,out of all the extreme tech upgrade this one is my favorite just the vibe you get when you see the room it just speaks to me
6oIlGhTgaKo,im not trying to pay rent i have no clue who chase is but  hes now my favorite
6oIlGhTgaKo,i feel like linuss tiny hands are op for building computers
6oIlGhTgaKo,this is by far the best tech upgrade so far living in your parents basement is now underrated
6oIlGhTgaKo,this is probably my favourite so far id love the space for all this
6oIlGhTgaKo,this was my favorite of the upgrades so far really enjoyed his setup
6oIlGhTgaKo,the finished setup here was probably one of my favorite in the series so far
6oIlGhTgaKo,cant wait for the next episode of linus shames his employees for having stuff from the office
6oIlGhTgaKo,chase is a really good storyteller  very likeable and pleasant voice compared to james d  very nice duo in this tech upgrade  keep it up 
6oIlGhTgaKo,this is my favorite series glad to see it pushing foward
6oIlGhTgaKo,i know this a shoot and stuff but linus genuinely seems like a cool boss
6oIlGhTgaKo,as someone who pays rent chase knows whats up
6oIlGhTgaKo,i love this kind of set up all systems laid out so clearly and pairing the crt with the computer looks so clean
6oIlGhTgaKo,how about i hold the monitor and you screw it in he knows linus all to well
6oIlGhTgaKo,chase has a great onscreen presence seems super comfortable on camera and speaks
6oIlGhTgaKo,its really cool seeing linus take the time to help with these setups
6oIlGhTgaKo,yes this is by far the best setup from this series all essential gaming needs fulfilled from retro to the latest gonna copy this setup later
6oIlGhTgaKo,i love how linus accuses every employee of stealing
6oIlGhTgaKo,chase is very good and humble person he definitely deserve this upgrade
6oIlGhTgaKo,im glad the breaking of andys bed still makes everyone laugh
6oIlGhTgaKo,i love this youtube channel its so wholesome watching the people at ltt media group just do random stuff like this
6oIlGhTgaKo,that crushed me when linus carelessly damaged his crt
6oIlGhTgaKo,linus if it doesnt make more fps its not included
6oIlGhTgaKo,linus needs to do an official extreme makeover tech edition show
6oIlGhTgaKo,loved this so gosh darn much the setup and room is just so gosh darn fantastic  so worth the money and time it took to put it all together
6oIlGhTgaKo,linus making fun of chase for rent dodging by living with his parents what a chad chase is
6oIlGhTgaKo,i love these series d
6oIlGhTgaKo,glad the meshify 2 compact case is doing well i upgraded to it myself and love it even more than the original
6oIlGhTgaKo,the more i see linus the less i see him as a boss and more as a friend
6oIlGhTgaKo,damn i wouldnt even know where to start with an upgrade like this great vid
6oIlGhTgaKo,gets a salary lives for free gets intel to pay for his furniture
6oIlGhTgaKo,gotta say this has been my favourite upgrade so far
6oIlGhTgaKo,your intro in this video is amazing love your videos linus tech tips and kudos to the editors
6oIlGhTgaKo,that was the best extreme tech upgrade episode 
6oIlGhTgaKo,im not tryna pay rent in these covid times i am fully with him
6oIlGhTgaKo,all these videos lead me to believe that working for lmg comes with a multithousand dollar gaming pc as a signing bonus
6oIlGhTgaKo,i love the retro mods id love to see more lmg retro things but im not sure which channel it would go to
6oIlGhTgaKo,this is the best one setup yet but not on andys comfort level
6oIlGhTgaKo,if i had the money i would pay linus thousands to build me a sick gaming room or even a pc
6oIlGhTgaKo,i like how simple this upgrade is and yet everything was indeed upgraded quite a bit
6oIlGhTgaKo,both ram kits being corsairs i wouldnt be surprised if it was possible to swap the heatspreaders from the fancy ones to the faster ones
6oIlGhTgaKo,by far the sickest gamer hovel ever incredible so jealous
6oIlGhTgaKo,i would pay all of my double digit savings to go to linus tech university if linus was the professor the entire time linus is a tech god
6oIlGhTgaKo,i very much enjoy chase
6oIlGhTgaKo,when did linus become so chill what a great guy
6oIlGhTgaKo,this is my favourite tech upgrade so far well balanced amazing setup this guy knows what is he doing
6oIlGhTgaKo,i have the same reaction as linus when they include those ridiculous usb cables with enterprise monitors i unbox
6oIlGhTgaKo,linuss face when he breaks the bed gets me every time
6oIlGhTgaKo,watching this series while in the process of buying a house is definitely giving me some ideas of how i can set up stuff better at my new house
6oIlGhTgaKo,you dont need more than 16 gigs of ram in your gaming rig laughs in star citizen
6oIlGhTgaKo,this turned out awesome quick question does anyone know where they got the cool retro are from it looks cool
6oIlGhTgaKo,one of the things you may not know about chasei have literally never even seen chase before
6oIlGhTgaKo,i love this series its always so satisfying to watch 3
6oIlGhTgaKo,my favorite tech upgrade for sure more chase please
6oIlGhTgaKo,you know linus you can never ever ever let chase work from home again 
6oIlGhTgaKo,now this is an upgrade i can relate to very nice
6oIlGhTgaKo,chase seems like the most competent intel upgrade victim yet
6oIlGhTgaKo,linus always bashes on intel
6oIlGhTgaKo,god i wish my setup was as powerful amazing and all encompassing and as aesthetically fantastic as chases setup is
6oIlGhTgaKo,definitely one of my favorites so far
6oIlGhTgaKo,i dont look too far into intelamd type things but sometimes intels packaging brings out a feeling i didnt know existed for packaging
6oIlGhTgaKo,chase is so chill his voice is so calm that is it contagiously calming lol
6oIlGhTgaKo,linus manages to sound like a boomer and the most techsavvy guy ever
6oIlGhTgaKo,he has been
6oIlGhTgaKo,i think i speak for everyone when i say we need a compilation of linus pulling out his screwdriver
6oIlGhTgaKo,awesome would love to do this setup
6oIlGhTgaKo,after having a gaming cave like this i wouldnt move out of my parents house either the end result is pure fire
6oIlGhTgaKo,graphics driver acts up
6oIlGhTgaKo,love this series

1SAezMUB8sw,this guy is finally eating at peace ngl
1SAezMUB8sw,everyone out here saying how hes eating normally for once yet the guy still downed something like 18 slices of pizza in a sitting
1SAezMUB8sw,imagine 6 pizza guys each from different chains looking at each other outside of matts house
1SAezMUB8sw,can you imagine the heart attack these brand execs must have had watching this video especially howies when he opened the box and there was no pepperoni
1SAezMUB8sw,damn first time seeing matt eating normally rare occasion
1SAezMUB8sw,theres something about this man eating food that will forever be beyond satisfying
1SAezMUB8sw,love the content its so interesting to see it from a different country really appreciate you guys you are so nice and loving to one another
1SAezMUB8sw,the fact that he got all 3 right while blindfolded makes me trust this tier list more matt knows what hes talking about
1SAezMUB8sw,i like these tier list videos keep em comin
1SAezMUB8sw,hungry howies always been my number 1 they make it the most well done and their flavored crust is unmatched
1SAezMUB8sw,im surprised about round table i havent had them in years but their sauce was always my favorite part it was a little spicy and always in good quantity
1SAezMUB8sw,i like to imagine all of the pizza delivery guys showing up at the same time that would be so confusing lol
1SAezMUB8sw,id love more passive eating videos like this even a food vlog with your favorite foods ever or more tier lists 
1SAezMUB8sw,i love that eating comes up every time he tries a slice as if we dont know what hes doing lol
1SAezMUB8sw,love these videos you definitely should do fish sandwiches from fast food places
1SAezMUB8sw,i would do a tier list but with only the specialty pizzas
1SAezMUB8sw,the deliverymans that were all gathered in one place mustve been very confused
1SAezMUB8sw,this is fun to watch but it generally depends on the branch youve ordered from and whos made it
1SAezMUB8sw,enjoyed the tier list  i think it adds to it that you are tasting them as you are going along
1SAezMUB8sw,not gonna lie little caesars varies heavily
1SAezMUB8sw,im genuinely surprised pizza hut didnt rank higher looks like costco can outpizza the hut
1SAezMUB8sw,i love seeing this guy eat his food in the normal way
1SAezMUB8sw,can i just say what an inspiration you are matt to the people who find food challenging thankyou thankyou thankyou
1SAezMUB8sw,this was the perfect video to watch while i was eating pizza
1SAezMUB8sw,id agree that no big fast food pizza chains are stier its the local places making it fresh from scratch that make stier pizzas
1SAezMUB8sw,these tier list videos are awesome man
1SAezMUB8sw,more reviews on food like this please
1SAezMUB8sw,ive had pizza all over the us and theres no better pizza than little cesars deep dish pizza i know ill never become a professional taster with that choice
1SAezMUB8sw,this is the calmest ive ever seen him eat its a nice change
1SAezMUB8sw,ever since little caesars updated their menu a few years ago its been super good every time ive tried it compared to most of the same places in this video
1SAezMUB8sw,really enjoy these types of videos  hope you can do more of them and hope they put less of a strain on your body too
1SAezMUB8sw,thanks for doing this has given me two new things to try hungry howies and the batman calzone i appreciate you matt stonie
1SAezMUB8sw,cant explain how happy i was when little cesars made btier
1SAezMUB8sw,glad to see you eat peacefully and honestly enjoyed this type of video
1SAezMUB8sw,the cheese pizza from dominos looks so good meanwhile my local dominos cheese looks and tastes like literal cardboard
1SAezMUB8sw,i see you taking time to enjoy the food this time 
1SAezMUB8sw,dominos pan made pizza costco pizza and detroit style pizza is to die for
1SAezMUB8sw,this is the timestamps of all the pizza franchises
1SAezMUB8sw,i can just imagine the 3 delivery guys seeing eachother deliver 3 pizzas to the same house
1SAezMUB8sw,enjoyed this new style of video maybe a once a month thing would be great definetly want to see a classic buffalo bonein wing tier list
1SAezMUB8sw,ive never had a good pizza hut pizza lol
1SAezMUB8sw,for someone that eats as much as you i definitely trust your critiques and rankings lol
1SAezMUB8sw,i like how hes casually eating and still ate over 8 slices of pizza
1SAezMUB8sw,i love me some little ceasars deluxe pizza it never disappoints and always comes in freeh  warm
1SAezMUB8sw,you have to try the cinnamon howie bread from hungry howies it is amazing
1SAezMUB8sw,another peaceful eating love it matt hoping to see more of this videos
1SAezMUB8sw,i love this please do this with french fries wendy s checkersrallys and popeyes
1SAezMUB8sw,pizza hut is my favorite of the ones around where i live i do understand the complications though lol
1SAezMUB8sw,growing up in michigan i can safely say that you have to go with a standard pie and not the specialty flatbread for hungry howies lol
1SAezMUB8sw,i think little casesars is underrated the stuffed crust is amazing
1SAezMUB8sw,pizza hut and costco  both are good  my favorite ones not tested ion this group are uno and sbarro even with the grease i like the big sbarro slices lol
1SAezMUB8sw,plain ole cheese pizza is so underrated man its a classic absolutely delicious in its simplicity
1SAezMUB8sw,ive only ever had hungry howies pizza one time my friend and i joked about how they had a salt flavored crust it was good pizza just way too salty
1SAezMUB8sw,idk why but the papa johns and little ceasers near my house are absolutely banging id bet a lot of these places just vary by the restaurant
1SAezMUB8sw,matt never fails us with these videos might eventually eat everything in the world he is a great example of how you feel when your starving
1SAezMUB8sw,costco deserves the throne theyve always been know for the huge slices and awesome pizza
1SAezMUB8sw,pizza hut fresh out the oven is always the best for me i believe its s tier
1SAezMUB8sw,i dont care what people say i will always love dominos i dont know if its the same in america but here in saskatchewan the garlic fingers are absolutely delicious
1SAezMUB8sw,costco is great i just wish they kept the combo supreme pizza at the food courts
1SAezMUB8sw,never tried costco pizza i will give it a try after watching this d
1SAezMUB8sw,ive always said if you dont get dominos with the garlic crust dont get dominos at all
1SAezMUB8sw,do more of these please
1SAezMUB8sw,stonie the calzone always fully stuffed 
1SAezMUB8sw,papa johns is superior ngl i love the sweet sauce plus the fact that they dont have an influx of sauce on their pizzas
1SAezMUB8sw,i always get stuffed crust when i order from little ceasers because their cheese for it is so good
1SAezMUB8sw,love these tier list vids
1SAezMUB8sw,i love these kinds of videos
1SAezMUB8sw,we need more of this
1SAezMUB8sw,hungry howies has always been criminally underrated the custom crust you can get makes it great for a fast food place
1SAezMUB8sw,the fact that costco beat the top pizza companies speaks volume

3tZXQlh8vO4,if they have not been given what they were promised ie in a verbal contract
3tZXQlh8vO4,feels nice that bbc brings my neighbors problem to light for all to see  i feel horrible that we little people couldnt do anything to selfish people in power
3tZXQlh8vO4,nice coverage if global channel like yours pressurize for sure the global biggies will try to behave as per rules and the societies will be happy
3tZXQlh8vO4,thank you bbc for being on their side
3tZXQlh8vO4,it is an old story thats never changespoliticians andor parliament who are bribed by the big companies pleasehelp this poor people
3tZXQlh8vO4,so much injustice for these people
3tZXQlh8vO4,the companies should be made to pay for the building of a town for these people and then leave them in charge the people
3tZXQlh8vO4,the people give up their land   well that sure was a bad idea
3tZXQlh8vO4,johnson and johnson used me as a human guinea pig  minnesotas attorney general wouldnt give me the time of day  im in pain every step i take
3tZXQlh8vO4,heart breaking n need solutions
3tZXQlh8vO4,there is a simple solution to this impose sanctions on palm oil coming from indonesia and excessively fine companies who buy it from them
3tZXQlh8vO4,i never buy products containing palm oil anymore for this reason
3tZXQlh8vO4,very disturbing documentary their situation is very common in many parts of the world their ancestral lands were taken by big corporations and in return giving back nothing
3tZXQlh8vO4,time for those farmers to ditch those farms and shift to more sustainable and profitable agroforestry or regenerative agriculture
3tZXQlh8vO4,the world needs to get off its addiction of palm oil
3tZXQlh8vO4,a promise is a verbal contract which is valid in law the big companies have commited fraud
3tZXQlh8vO4,great video youve remind me of what someone once said
3tZXQlh8vO4,when the proletariat failing to see the justice of this bourgeois economy begins to murmur the policemans club is called into active service
3tZXQlh8vO4,helping one person might not change the whole world
3tZXQlh8vO4,greed has no boundaries as an american i will do my part and not buy kellogg or johnsonjohnson products hopefully others will follow suit
3tZXQlh8vO4,its sounds like modern day colonialism truly distressing that local communities go through such atrocities its nice that their stories are being shared so that they get justice
3tZXQlh8vO4,feeling very sad for those innocent people government please do justice for them atleast in the form of compensation for all those years
3tZXQlh8vO4,isnt capitalism after all just the strong taking advantage of the week
3tZXQlh8vO4,gave up using products with pal oil totally unethical business
3tZXQlh8vO4,we need to start profit capping these companies so the money goes back into pay pensions and infrastructure we need to make companies work for society
3tZXQlh8vO4,we need to start a petition and make the people suffer ad and the farmers win
3tZXQlh8vO4,politicians can solve this easily but they dont care farmers

3tZXQlh8vO4,they should simply take the plantations by force
3tZXQlh8vO4,more than a hint of palm oil greasing of palms going on here methinks
3tZXQlh8vO4,o nation ofmuhammad
3tZXQlh8vO4,in indonesia the old olligarchs that are related to soehartos family can do pretty much whatever they want
3tZXQlh8vO4,corporationthey dont deserve it
3tZXQlh8vO4,crazy country
3tZXQlh8vO4,i dont buy anything that contains palm oil i have read it isnt good for you
3tZXQlh8vO4,palm oil is not even needed its a luxury product
3tZXQlh8vO4,big corporations big greed exploitation for profit

3tZXQlh8vO4,wtf salim group also has many companies in my country this greedy company doing same thing in our country wtf
3tZXQlh8vO4,shameful just shameful
3tZXQlh8vO4,the story is the same all over africa with cocoa coffee etc
3tZXQlh8vO4,its normal when they have no income
3tZXQlh8vO4,not missing millions more like billions
3tZXQlh8vO4,its not outright stated but this is state sponsored land acquisition
3tZXQlh8vO4,we dont need billionaires start getting rid of them
3tZXQlh8vO4,corruption is no stranger in government and even religion
3tZXQlh8vO4,its like stealing from a baby if i was in charged i would have the heads of the cowards that showed up with guns done and done
3tZXQlh8vO4,the answer is to stop buying processed food
3tZXQlh8vO4,why arent these multinational corporations ban on buying palm oil from companies who do not share the profits with the indigenous population
3tZXQlh8vO4,these companies are pure evil smgdh
3tZXQlh8vO4,if we really care about these people so the least to do is to stop consuming products that had palm oil
3tZXQlh8vO4,its called greed 
3tZXQlh8vO4,the tribes dont do anything why do they expect to be paid
3tZXQlh8vO4,we should boycott kellogs products
3tZXQlh8vO4,greedy politicians and businessmen
3tZXQlh8vO4,got to love all these hypocritical comments
3tZXQlh8vO4,i hope they listen
3tZXQlh8vO4,my research we just need only need at least 30 per cent of forest each country that produces it thats all we need to feed the population
3tZXQlh8vO4,not buying things with palm oil anymore also boycotting these corporations
3tZXQlh8vO4,nowits will becom global issues
3tZXQlh8vO4,the left boycotting jjfinalllly

6DYgImG1CKo,she managed to be so factual straightforward and scientific yet didnt come off as robotic
6DYgImG1CKo,i adore this woman i want to read everything shes written
6DYgImG1CKo,i could listen to this woman all day not a wasted syllable and each  word resonant and meaningful brava
6DYgImG1CKo,based on everything she said i am so interested how shed explain asexuality aromantic ppl and polyamory
6DYgImG1CKo,love is primordial adaptable it is eternal can we just take a minute to appreciate that this woman is simultaneously scientific and poetic
6DYgImG1CKo,id be very interested to hear what she thinks about people who dont experience romantic attraction and whether thats related to conditions that affect your dopamine like adhd
6DYgImG1CKo,soulmates dont need to be romantic they can be friends family or other figures in your life not just romantic partners
6DYgImG1CKo,i love how she states her answer in the topic sentence then explain it this is like listening to a well written and enjoyable essay
6DYgImG1CKo,id love to hear her take on arospec and polyam people i know the majority of people are monogamous and alloromantic but it would be interesting
6DYgImG1CKo,id be really curious to hear what she has to say about asexuality and aromantic people
6DYgImG1CKo,id love to hear her thoughts on people falling in love with celebrities and people theyve never met
6DYgImG1CKo,if anyone is interested about the test mentioned by dr fisher its called the anatomy of love i got builder as primary and director as secondary
6DYgImG1CKo,how about depression how will it affect our ability to love and feel attachment my theory is that it will most likely have a negative effect
6DYgImG1CKo,i like how she kept us hanging onto every single word she said the impact  that too while explaining complex scientific stuff
6DYgImG1CKo,the human brain is not made to deal with more than 59 options after that the brain just spaces out
6DYgImG1CKo,i hope this woman comes back and answer some questions related nonmonogamy a bit more
6DYgImG1CKo,so wait with her definition of the distinction between romantic and platonic lovedoes that mean i romantically love both my spouse and my best friend
6DYgImG1CKo,she needs a youtube channel or something id definitely watch her analysis of love
6DYgImG1CKo,she should really make a ted talk a podcast some sort of channel she explains so well
6DYgImG1CKo,hearing obsession and jealousy explained as both natural instincts is so insanely relieving
6DYgImG1CKo,i need more episodes with her this is deeply fascinating
6DYgImG1CKo,i love this because it explains the most childish reaction to love and normalizes it
6DYgImG1CKo,if she was a writer she would be a great writer at romance genre or at character building in general
6DYgImG1CKo,please bring her back to speak on her views in aromantics and polyamory
6DYgImG1CKo,i love this lady shes so likeable and the way she talks is so soothing i could listen to her all day all the love to her
6DYgImG1CKo,this is just fascinating absolutely fascinating
6DYgImG1CKo,i was delighted that she did not take a negative view on how technology has changed dating and relationships she simply addressed our own misuse of it
6DYgImG1CKo,send your dna in to tomorrow said so well as a biologist and a realist that nails what life and reproduction is all about
6DYgImG1CKo,dr helen sounds very confident and knowledgeable its very reassuring i feel like ill believe in anything she says
6DYgImG1CKo,shes is incredible with words she makes love sound so much more mystical and special than how we all kinda consider it
6DYgImG1CKo,would love if they had a second video about polyamory and aromantics  asexuals
6DYgImG1CKo,we need a part 2 this was very interesting
6DYgImG1CKo,this was not enough time she was an amazing speaker and teacher incredibly interesting and engaging bring her back
6DYgImG1CKo,i hope you guys bring her back this was amazing and so eye opening i really enjoyed this and her presentation
6DYgImG1CKo,i do hope there is a next time this was so enjoyable
6DYgImG1CKo,i want more of this woman loved hearing her answers
6DYgImG1CKo,just took the test and its really interesting how she groups people i feel like you could also connect this with the mbti system lol
6DYgImG1CKo,oh shoot
6DYgImG1CKo,this woman is so professional and able to capture my attention by talking to me great teacher i bet
6DYgImG1CKo,this was hella good gave me goosebumps even well humored and funny but deep enough to move me to near tears in awe as well
6DYgImG1CKo,this lady is fantastic i would love to see another episode with her answering more questions
6DYgImG1CKo,im in love with this woman the speech the arguments the science the posture perfection
6DYgImG1CKo,wow learning about partner choosing being related to hormones like estrogen serotonin dopamine etc is so interesting this makes so much interesting
6DYgImG1CKo,shes extremely charismatic and intelligent love how she explains everything would love to read something by her or even meet her someday
6DYgImG1CKo,didnt think anyone could top the ask a mortitian series in my opinion anyway but she was really interesting  great video
6DYgImG1CKo,i sometimes experience romantic love for more than 1 person at a time what she described as soulmates i can feel for 2 or more people at once
6DYgImG1CKo,shes so great would love her take on aromanticism and asexuality
6DYgImG1CKo,i greatly appreciate calling her a biological anthropologist and not just anthropologist which is such a broad term anyone that studies anything could call themselves that super interesting topic
6DYgImG1CKo,shes got it  and what a great teacher  science rules
6DYgImG1CKo,so far im minoring in biological anthropology this is the first time ive seen a youtube video with a biological anthropologist
6DYgImG1CKo,unrelated  but the skz
6DYgImG1CKo,i would like more of her please
6DYgImG1CKo,really appreciated the clear explanation of the difference between romantic and platonic love  ive always been confused about that
6DYgImG1CKo,thank you so much for this ive been having such a hard time and just the encouraging and understanding tone of this video made me feel so much better
6DYgImG1CKo,love being scientific is just so wholesome makes me very happy
6DYgImG1CKo,this is a great video and i truly adore dr fisher and her way of speaking and explaining things now
6DYgImG1CKo,i love hearing the biological breakdown of emotions like love and this was delightful  loved dr fisher very soothing very interesting really enjoyed this vid
6DYgImG1CKo,to me this just seems like classic paradigmprison thinkingi want to get on this womans scientist team and do so many experiments involving poly people asexual people aromantic people etc
6DYgImG1CKo,i really enjoyed her well thought out answers that were fun clear and impressionable
6DYgImG1CKo,this was so fun i found it surprising how much she advocated for monogamy regarding love but it was still fun and informative
6DYgImG1CKo,i loved her  her facts and her thoroughness can people on twitter ask more stupid questions so she can be back please
6DYgImG1CKo,would like to hear her thought on polyamory considering she doesnt believe you could have more than one soulmate at a time as well as her thoughts on aromantic people

LFQ3LkVF5sM,this all sounds like absolute hell for consumers rights repairability upgradability and overall variety in the pc space
LFQ3LkVF5sM,hearing this i imagine a dark future where pcs are handled like phones today  sorry your 2 year old pc is now irrelevant because were not giving it anymore updates
LFQ3LkVF5sM,while i can see this change as an inevitability i just hope the serviceability and upgradeability will not be impacted as hard as i think they will be
LFQ3LkVF5sM,i wont ever give up the ability to modify my computer
LFQ3LkVF5sM,man this is something
LFQ3LkVF5sM,2 things
LFQ3LkVF5sM,im just gonna pray that the pc industry does not head this way i still want to feel the incredible feeling of unboxing an rtx 3090 not unboxing a cube
LFQ3LkVF5sM,yeah teething period thats gotta be the understatement of the century
LFQ3LkVF5sM,and the great thing about a small integrated system is that when it breaks you get to buy a whole new system
LFQ3LkVF5sM,when amd manages to improve performace per watt with 50 each two years these gpus are not dead but in their prime
LFQ3LkVF5sM,honestly i would really love to have the moduality of the current pc stay forever
LFQ3LkVF5sM,now hold on theres
LFQ3LkVF5sM,power efficiency is absolutely irrelevant i would love to get a 600w cpu and a 1000w gpu ill get a 20a socket for a little more power any day
LFQ3LkVF5sM,two things important for me from this vid
LFQ3LkVF5sM,pcs desktops will never die same thing was said before when everyone thought laptops and phones and tablets would kill them
LFQ3LkVF5sM,back compatible functions are good but some of the really old ones could probably be replaced with emulation layers or virtual machines
LFQ3LkVF5sM,yesss lets put the entire system on a single pcb so we need throw everything away when one part goes bad
LFQ3LkVF5sM,im really hoping that this is only implemented on business computers and company technology and not solely for consumer products
LFQ3LkVF5sM,i remember when they thought laptops would replace desktops i dont think theyll ever fully replace desktops maybe itll be smaller and compact
LFQ3LkVF5sM,thank you this was an amazingly researched video highly appreciated
LFQ3LkVF5sM,i like these more philosophical ones this was very well done learned a lot
LFQ3LkVF5sM,it might be painful but this is the future
LFQ3LkVF5sM,clickbait title aside this was an
LFQ3LkVF5sM,the times when it was way cheaper to build a hackintosh than to buy a mac are gone
LFQ3LkVF5sM,even with a switch to arm i believe the socketed chip on motherboard paradigm will stick around people will still want upgradability and expandability in their desktop computers
LFQ3LkVF5sM,all of those parts dont look excessive it looks gorgeous
LFQ3LkVF5sM,i do think intel amd and nvidia should definitely heavily invest in arm too it would enrich computing market
LFQ3LkVF5sM,old time linuxfreebsd user thank you for being relevant
LFQ3LkVF5sM,actually i cant wait to see the ability to use socs in standard pc boxes i bet thatll happen lol
LFQ3LkVF5sM,i enjoy hearing you unpack and elaborate on computer architecture stuffs
LFQ3LkVF5sM,more of these business tech videos anthony is a great host
LFQ3LkVF5sM,one neat thing about risc is
LFQ3LkVF5sM,this will make game preservation a lot harder backwards compatibility is one of the main benefits of pc
LFQ3LkVF5sM,very unlikely to happen and if it does go this route innovation will degrade due to a reduction in open competition
LFQ3LkVF5sM,man you did a great job explaining this

ZK7ZUJyMqYk,nice looking car but still will end up in the garage every week like all the rest
ZK7ZUJyMqYk,imaging paying that much for a car with a laggyunresponsive infotainment system
ZK7ZUJyMqYk,20 wont get you far in this knowing you run cars on the bar above the empty

2xVBAqybA_8,she needs to rewrite all the textbooks her analogies make sense
2xVBAqybA_8,dr biberdorf is a fantastic explainer i would love to hear her give a talklecture
2xVBAqybA_8,she literally was my professor at ut austin shes the best its so cool to see her do this
2xVBAqybA_8,i just graduated with my bachelors in chemistry and shes much better at explaining general chemistry theories in an understandable way than most of my professors
2xVBAqybA_8,this is absolutely the first time kickthepj has ever been featured in a youtube video congrats to kickthepj for making it onto youtube
2xVBAqybA_8,yes pj was joking but youd be surprised how many people dont know what chemicals are and assume theyre always dangerous
2xVBAqybA_8,her excitement and energy is contagious glad shes been brought back
2xVBAqybA_8,i love how visibly happy and excited kate always gets when shes just made something with chemistry so adorable
2xVBAqybA_8,what a creative way to explain double replacement reaction in a nutshell
2xVBAqybA_8,an absolute energizer bunny professor the ideal chem professor for all ages
2xVBAqybA_8,the word chemicals these days get a bad name in many fields but chemistry and chemicals as a whole is actually super interesting and useful
2xVBAqybA_8,omg poor pj first removing his checkmark and then actually answering his joke tweet
2xVBAqybA_8,i wish i had you as a teacher you can explain chemistry like a genius i will use your examples when i help kids with chemistry for sure
2xVBAqybA_8,shes all perky and fun and explains everything quite well
2xVBAqybA_8,she seems so fun would listen to her explain anything lol
2xVBAqybA_8,pj is bringing so many people here you guys better give him his royalties
2xVBAqybA_8,love her energy and simple to understand metaphors
2xVBAqybA_8,you can tell she loves chemistry love her vibe
2xVBAqybA_8,you are a disney chemistry nerd and i love it someone so excited by what they do
2xVBAqybA_8,i really thought it mightve been a joke holy cow they really edited out the verified check and used pjs tweet im shook
2xVBAqybA_8,i just love seeing people being excited to explain things
2xVBAqybA_8,finally something up my ally chemist here enjoying this also you can break a bond between atoms just by giving them enough energy
2xVBAqybA_8,i cant believe shes answering pjs unhinged tweet
2xVBAqybA_8,i love her enthusiasm and how she explains things in the simplistic form
2xVBAqybA_8,that was a flawless description of how bonds form perfectly at the level of the person asking the question master teacher as well
2xVBAqybA_8,i feel like i could pass any class shes teaching
2xVBAqybA_8,i hope there will be a part 2 of this i recently got interested in chemistry because of my professor and now kate is spicing it up
2xVBAqybA_8,the ryan blake analogy tho
2xVBAqybA_8,this is what i love about chemistry the more you learn the more you realized everything is a huge huge huge chain of reactions
2xVBAqybA_8,if she was my chemistry teacher i would have made good grades since i sucked at chemistry back when i was in high school
2xVBAqybA_8,she explained in such a beautiful simplictic way that made sense and her enthusiasm about answering the questions kept me engaged for the whole video lovely
2xVBAqybA_8,i hated and i mean hated chemistry in high school these questions are so good and interesting to see answered and this chemist is so good at answering them
2xVBAqybA_8,i absolutely adore her energy
2xVBAqybA_8,i love her enthusiasm and energy she really loves her profession

_2jULayKYTs,theory the warden actually has the spirits of 5 children in it and the ancient city is a pizzeria
_2jULayKYTs,wither you cant defeat me
_2jULayKYTs,disk 5 serves as a warning about opening a new portal
_2jULayKYTs,adult minecraft will never become scary its made out of blocks
_2jULayKYTs,ancient builders were saved the warden freed us
_2jULayKYTs,mini theory idea for matpat whats the deal with the monster spawners
_2jULayKYTs,id like to see a video responding to the sound of disks 11 13 and 5 being played together since it oddly flows together really well
_2jULayKYTs,builder 1 let me get this straight
_2jULayKYTs,warden drops sculk catalyst
_2jULayKYTs,something else id like to add is why the sculk hasnt spread any further its because of the lack of humans
_2jULayKYTs,by the way discs 13 and 5 played together actually sounds relatively orderly and makes it seem like they were meant to be played together just a theory though
_2jULayKYTs,theory the endermen are ancient builders they take blocks from top world and transport it to the end to try to kill the warden with the dragon
_2jULayKYTs,ive literally been wondering about the old civilizations for years in minecraft
_2jULayKYTs,the reason why the ancient builders werent able to defeat the wither is because they forgot the combat system changed after the 19 update
_2jULayKYTs,that was a great theory and almost sounds like a fact and im curious to know the origins of the mushroom island as well
_2jULayKYTs,it has been a while since one of these actually felt like a theory video so i am very pleased keep up the great theories
_2jULayKYTs,i like the reference from my childhood where the wild things live one of my favourite books brings back so much nostalgia
_2jULayKYTs,when theorist was sponsoring squarespace he perfectly said it every 10 seconds
_2jULayKYTs,minecraft community the warden is terrifying kill it
_2jULayKYTs,i love how he describes the wither as a haunting floating nightmare
_2jULayKYTs,you can argue that the thing i forgot its name is sentient
_2jULayKYTs,i actually wish that the ancient builders wouldve armed themselves and fought back against the wardens along with the golems
_2jULayKYTs,after they evacuated the city from the warden that would be when disc 11 starts playing as they make their way to the surface
_2jULayKYTs,and along with that its strange how we keep going to one thing escape attempts via portal
_2jULayKYTs,also the ancient builders thought that to revive one human it would require wither three skeleton skulls again hinting to the number 13 which has many references to the lore
_2jULayKYTs,i love when minecraft makes a update promising better caves and then ends up turning into 3 updates and making frogs
_2jULayKYTs,i found out that if you put subtitles on and listen to the disk it tells you what some of the sounds are like footsteps and portals and stuff
_2jULayKYTs,i think its a new dimension it would explain the mix of cave sounds nether sounds a wither and deep dark
_2jULayKYTs,weird how the wither is involved in the ancient city i feel like the warden is a bit too powerful cause it can kill anything easily even the wither
_2jULayKYTs,another thing i tried throwing a bottle o enchant on a skulk catalyst and the exp did not disappear meaning that dead enemies souls are what spreads the skulk
_2jULayKYTs,i just love the warden and everything sculk its not our enemy like zombies and skeletons its just trying to survive it will attack anything and its very cute
_2jULayKYTs,from cave noises to sculk shriekers who knew that a simple block game could introduce the most disturbing noises ever
_2jULayKYTs,lets all take a moment to appreciate the true hero of this story the absolute madlad who was running around recording all of this on a music disk
_2jULayKYTs,im surprised when he said 2 hits it takes 2 hits with full diamond armour with protection 2 and with 1 hit you get half a heart
_2jULayKYTs,i think the phantoms sound more like the sculk shrieker
_2jULayKYTs,this theory really shows that the enderman could really be the ancient builders
_2jULayKYTs,this actually explains why you cant find the wither that was summoned way back when it was already defeated
_2jULayKYTs,imagine if the moment matpat finally solves the story of minecraft mojang is like nope your interpretations were wrong start over dude
_2jULayKYTs,ive actually been working on restoring the ancient city not easy i also would love to see a new dimension more worlds to conquer
_2jULayKYTs,damn these ancient builders couldnt catch a break huh
_2jULayKYTs,this is one of the craziest yet best theories about minecraft ive heard yet
_2jULayKYTs,play all 3 of the music discs 5 11 and 13 together mat it syncs up insanely well
_2jULayKYTs,builder 1 remember when we built a creature out of bones and souls that is causing our extinction builder 2 yeah what about it builder 1 lets do it again
_2jULayKYTs,this is a super cool theory i love it
_2jULayKYTs,who else wants this to be animated
_2jULayKYTs,im honestly shocked you didnt mention the reversed xp sounds i really think there is something to that
_2jULayKYTs,just watched your quiet place theory and the wool and carpet placements reminded me of it
_2jULayKYTs,your cat skip
_2jULayKYTs,ah the ancient builders so smart that they can open portals with redstone yet so pathetic that they cant just spam harming potions
_2jULayKYTs,try playing 511 and 13 in unison it creates something pretty interesting id be curious to see your interpretation
_2jULayKYTs,discs 5 11 and 13 sound like they go together when you play them together
_2jULayKYTs,the story breakdown from the new music disc is really cool looore
_2jULayKYTs,the skulk is rather similar to the protomolecule from the expanse
_2jULayKYTs,also interesting that the end portal frame has the same palette as the warden
_2jULayKYTs,you should listen to disc 511 and 13 together it really makes a mysterious confusing story
_2jULayKYTs,you should also touch on the odd illager lookin structured in the city as well
_2jULayKYTs,i like the idea that the warden doesnt even drop anything useful

rDK4D5zwJkE,im a jays fan but i always check to see how ohtani did
rDK4D5zwJkE,shohei doing amazing things really hope we see him in the playoffs
rDK4D5zwJkE,one of the best pitchers in the league atm and that red white and blue uni
rDK4D5zwJkE,ohtani back to top 10 in mlb for war with this dominating pitching performance lets go shohei
rDK4D5zwJkE,yesterday a hr today 11k big showhei keeps delivering
rDK4D5zwJkE,im nearly convinced shohei is a mythical creature
rDK4D5zwJkE,his back hurting literally carrying his whole team on it
rDK4D5zwJkE,shout out to rengifo back to back hr games the other players are stepping up on the angels
rDK4D5zwJkE,nice win hopefully ohtani with no injury
rDK4D5zwJkE,ohtani was the better pitcher on this night i really like the angels city connect uniforms
rDK4D5zwJkE,based of last season and this season ohtani is the best player in the league change my mind
rDK4D5zwJkE,lets go shohei masterful performance
rDK4D5zwJkE,solid game for ohtani
rDK4D5zwJkE,shohei ohtani victory create a team atmosphere
rDK4D5zwJkE,best example of one person to carry the entire team
rDK4D5zwJkE,ohtani has 24 strikeouts through 13 and 23 innings in his last 2 starts
rDK4D5zwJkE,shohei ohtani if you take the mound you win
rDK4D5zwJkE,i know lets have ohtani pitch every game that way the angels can win most of the time instead of losing most of the time
rDK4D5zwJkE,i know shohei is watching this channel and reading each comment
rDK4D5zwJkE,im a guardians fan and always keep an eye on ohtani
rDK4D5zwJkE,go halos go my favourite team from the golden state
rDK4D5zwJkE,opportunities dont happen you create them chris grosser
rDK4D5zwJkE,shohei ohtani is the best 2way player in baseball
rDK4D5zwJkE,after the last few months of this its just a hard time to be a sox fan jose abreu doing great tho
rDK4D5zwJkE,the los angeles angels are 3741
rDK4D5zwJkE,today i realized i came to mlb channel every day  not for ohtani but for reading comments on ohtani
rDK4D5zwJkE,shohei is a beast
rDK4D5zwJkE,i always though ohtani is a better hitter than pitcher and should focus more on hitting  but he turned it around this year
rDK4D5zwJkE,intentional walk for the pitcher
rDK4D5zwJkE,sho was grabbing his lower back hope he is okay
rDK4D5zwJkE,i hope ohtani didnt hurt himself
rDK4D5zwJkE,what are angels chances of playoffs now with this form and record
rDK4D5zwJkE,i hope ohtani didnt get hurt
rDK4D5zwJkE,white sox are brutal
rDK4D5zwJkE,i love you ohtani
rDK4D5zwJkE,shohei is still underrated
rDK4D5zwJkE,white sox really need some balance in the lineup
rDK4D5zwJkE,he already won mvp last year so is he going to win cy young this year
rDK4D5zwJkE,the crowd was giving a standingo but you can see ohtani mouthing a japanese curse word at
rDK4D5zwJkE,mlb best player shohei  ohtani
rDK4D5zwJkE,how do angels fans survive with that guy being their main caster
rDK4D5zwJkE,joe kelly is a mexicanamerican and his nationality is the united states but is it possible to compete in the wbc as a mexican national team
rDK4D5zwJkE,go sox go
rDK4D5zwJkE,wow the angels must be in first place
rDK4D5zwJkE,they wont even throw to the pitcher and who blames them when the pitcher is ohtani
rDK4D5zwJkE,taylor ward lost something when he crossed home in the 1st
rDK4D5zwJkE,ohtani should win the cy young award
rDK4D5zwJkE,shohei the goat ohtani
rDK4D5zwJkE,shohei we love you
rDK4D5zwJkE,angels blowpen can learn from this
rDK4D5zwJkE,go whitesox
rDK4D5zwJkE,chicago  vs  angeles
rDK4D5zwJkE,go angels
rDK4D5zwJkE,pitch ohtani against the braves
rDK4D5zwJkE,y wasnt wades dive in here
rDK4D5zwJkE,nice malherido en la palabra de bola
rDK4D5zwJkE,ohtani may have hurt his back
rDK4D5zwJkE,angels forever
rDK4D5zwJkE,god bless america
rDK4D5zwJkE,take care of yourself shohei
rDK4D5zwJkE,what time is it
rDK4D5zwJkE,can someone explain the angels jerseys are they new uniforms or throwbacks
rDK4D5zwJkE,white sox vs angels

vEAlw1WGdsY,i rather have kounde  koulibally one is young  the other with experience both will suit the prem  not over 50mill
vEAlw1WGdsY,if maguire is worth 80 million then de ligt is worth 2 billion  add ons
vEAlw1WGdsY,120 million euros103 million pounds thats incredibly steep i was expecting somewhere in the region of 6570 million other cbs are available at a more affordable price
vEAlw1WGdsY,understandably when chelsea here the numbers 100m the trauma comes back im sure the chelsea board will not go that far this season
vEAlw1WGdsY,interested fc doing what they do best
vEAlw1WGdsY,chelsea seem 2 be  interested  in alot of players but have signed nobody
vEAlw1WGdsY,he is a fantastic defender
vEAlw1WGdsY,they should get in koulibaly for 40 replace rudigar without standards dropping than wait for his price to drop
vEAlw1WGdsY,would be a great replacement for rudigersign him please
vEAlw1WGdsY,great signing if chelsea can get this done but that release clause is ridiculous get kounde in there
vEAlw1WGdsY,juve rn thier main problem is thier coach they have quality players but allegris tactics are outdated
vEAlw1WGdsY,this would be a fantastic signing
vEAlw1WGdsY,they need to be more than interested we need time for the team to gel
vEAlw1WGdsY,they really need a new top cb after losing two
vEAlw1WGdsY,de ligt will be untouchable
vEAlw1WGdsY,if tuchel can do with him what he did with rudiger he will become the best cb in the world
vEAlw1WGdsY,lukaku experience will not pave the way for the deal chelsea would not pay such a huge amount 
vEAlw1WGdsY,chelsea seem to be interested in fc
vEAlw1WGdsY,at first i was like people are reactionary when i saw all those interested fc posts im actually starting to believe them now lol
vEAlw1WGdsY,vamos usar jorginho na negociao
vEAlw1WGdsY,great to see todd woodwa i mean boehly so closely involved in transfers
vEAlw1WGdsY,imagine selling tomori who became champion last season to buy de ligt for over price fee is crazy
vEAlw1WGdsY,united should buy him omg
vEAlw1WGdsY,been found out since going to juve not sure why chelsea would want him
vEAlw1WGdsY,if de jong and de ligt end up in the prem too now thats it the other leagues should just give up the prem has all the stars now
vEAlw1WGdsY,yeah de ligt will great signing for chelsea and he can only get better at chelsea and win more trophies
vEAlw1WGdsY,juventus dont need him right fee he can go
vEAlw1WGdsY,they need to finance pogbas move
vEAlw1WGdsY,de ligt is so under the radar he needs to play for real or barca
vEAlw1WGdsY,his value surely must have dipped his performance juve was terrible
vEAlw1WGdsY,better go for lisandro martinez who is around 45m and also kounde or koulibaly120m is too much
vEAlw1WGdsY,for a reasonable price definetly
vEAlw1WGdsY,2032 and chelsea are close to signing jules kounde sky sports understands a deal is close
vEAlw1WGdsY,100 odds mil for someone whos not even starting when his rivals chiellini bonucci are retiring 
vEAlw1WGdsY,can anybody really see this deal happening
vEAlw1WGdsY,surely man utd should try and get him if pogba goes the opposite way even though theyve let pogba move for free good business sense that
vEAlw1WGdsY,he didnt have the greatest time at juventus tho and liverpool got konate for 40 million
vEAlw1WGdsY,chelsea will be interested in all the players but we wont buy a single player this window
vEAlw1WGdsY,brilliant bit of business if chelsea can get de ligt depending on the price
vEAlw1WGdsY,can chelsea possibly buy and save us from the trauma in business you act and not speculate
vEAlw1WGdsY,chelsea and man united are the only teams who have lacking in the squad but still they are only monitoring and considering players
vEAlw1WGdsY,city  50m haaland
vEAlw1WGdsY,the one explayer the clueless ten hag should be going after and isnt
vEAlw1WGdsY,sign de ligt and koulibaly sterling start broja gallagher
vEAlw1WGdsY,if i am a che fansi rather have koundede vrij than de ligt
vEAlw1WGdsY,who does chelsea not want that should be the news from now on
vEAlw1WGdsY,is this what qualifies as news nowadays pogbas agent going to milan equates him striking a deal for a 100 pound de ligtmake it make sense
vEAlw1WGdsY,aint seen de ligt for ages completely forgot him
vEAlw1WGdsY,kounde will be joining chelsea with him just get skriniar or bastoni no need to spend 120m on de ligt
vEAlw1WGdsY,need 2 centre back not just 1
vEAlw1WGdsY,if we can get de ligt and either koundekoulibaly then that will be massive hope we get him
vEAlw1WGdsY,harry maguire is available unbelievable player  top top player ps man united fan wouldnt lie to u
vEAlw1WGdsY,la dodgers is one of the biggest clubs in the usa and world if you think tb is not going to adapt fast you are delusional ktbffh
vEAlw1WGdsY,50 million max hes been mid for juve
vEAlw1WGdsY,i think 100 mil for a long term cb who is 22 and is one of the best is fair price and we should defo sign him
vEAlw1WGdsY,6570 million
vEAlw1WGdsY,should have kept tomori then we wouldnt be in this mess
vEAlw1WGdsY,this is a great purchase if they can get him but sterling  lewa dont even try that bs
vEAlw1WGdsY,manchester united plz we need him
vEAlw1WGdsY,van dijk is the benchmarkif he cost 75 mn no club sud pay more than that for any other player
vEAlw1WGdsY,wont happen lol se ligt wont leave juve till next season
vEAlw1WGdsY,good news
vEAlw1WGdsY,he is a good defender but not worth 103
vEAlw1WGdsY,my club chelsea is interested in almost all the players all over the world but has confidently signed noting
vEAlw1WGdsY,interested fc at it again
vEAlw1WGdsY,better get bremer and pau torres because de ligt is too costly
vEAlw1WGdsY,if he is available united will ruin the party just watch all ajax players are going united lol
vEAlw1WGdsY,chelsea  interested fc
vEAlw1WGdsY,chelsea fan here he is one of the most overrated center backs i have seen
vEAlw1WGdsY,yes please
vEAlw1WGdsY,ah yes the dutch mcguire
vEAlw1WGdsY,hey once it isnt any of our players go for it take that penalty and hand ball magnetic from them
vEAlw1WGdsY,chelsea no longer have more money than arsenal
vEAlw1WGdsY,another maguire  no thank you
vEAlw1WGdsY,any man united news please
vEAlw1WGdsY,60mil plus jorginho
vEAlw1WGdsY,chelsea cant sign him not just because i dont want them too but because of something to do with russia and ukraine this cant happen
vEAlw1WGdsY,italian and serie a fan here de ligt is massively overrated positionally he is still naive and gives away the most stupid of fouls chelsea can do better
vEAlw1WGdsY,overrated hes not on the same level of skriniar or bremer but he earns 3 or 5 times more than them his operation was a disaster for juventus
vEAlw1WGdsY,hes wort it
vEAlw1WGdsY,hell no
vEAlw1WGdsY,what exactly is happening at chelsea de ligt is the worst defender for juventus
vEAlw1WGdsY,prefer fofana
vEAlw1WGdsY,chelseawe sell you william saliba for 50 million good price d
vEAlw1WGdsY,i dont know how can i pronounce matthijs
vEAlw1WGdsY,so u let rudiger go to go spend more money on a player that hasnt played in epl yes he is younger but the epl is no seri a

VUXpU_vnNYE,a house divided against itself cannot stand it can only fall
VUXpU_vnNYE,thats just what the planet needs more people
VUXpU_vnNYE,clarence thomas needs to be removed since he didnt remove himself with a case involving his wife
VUXpU_vnNYE,when my mom was 8 years old in soviet russia she lost her mother my grandma due to illegal abortion  family had 3 kids 
VUXpU_vnNYE,apparently supreme court take abortion issue more serious than gun issue what a sad nation
VUXpU_vnNYE,sad factbefore today rowe vs wade being over turned there are over 460000 children in foster care and now that number will grow
VUXpU_vnNYE,a lot of women are going to be at great medical riskim pro choice  my choice is life  your choice is none of my business
VUXpU_vnNYE,simple dont be scared it sends the wrong message vote on candidates that will support your rights and who will stand by you change comes to those who seek it
VUXpU_vnNYE,bring on back street abortions and maternal deaths from bacterial septicaemia  on the other hand the percentage of school children dying from school shootings should be less  well done usa
VUXpU_vnNYE,the real question is prenatal and birth costs   no time limit national child support law
VUXpU_vnNYE,problem is we dont have good judges anymore
VUXpU_vnNYE,it took the supreme court 50 years to come to this conclusion
VUXpU_vnNYE,this would never happen if it were men who could get pregnant
VUXpU_vnNYE,this supreme court need to take a good hard look at its own constitutionality
VUXpU_vnNYE,i thought the abortion issue was decided 50 years ago huh
VUXpU_vnNYE,the supreme court on thursday states dont have the power to regulate how when and where you carry guns
VUXpU_vnNYE,the supreme court had to do this before clarence thomas and his wife are investigated
VUXpU_vnNYE,every american is granted the right of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness do with that what you will
VUXpU_vnNYE,to the two prominent senators who say they were mislead
VUXpU_vnNYE,hundred years ago you fought
VUXpU_vnNYE,is there anyone in the world more mislead than susan collins
VUXpU_vnNYE,i didnt hear anyone talk about how all of these babies were going to be taken care of
VUXpU_vnNYE,under such a stressful and duress circumstances all of us ladies should economically help one another
VUXpU_vnNYE,when u support some start and thenu see him on this stage really proud of bro
VUXpU_vnNYE,wow america really goes backwards in time what happened to so supposed freedom
VUXpU_vnNYE,we just went back 50 years vote
VUXpU_vnNYE,my compassion to young women in danger of their life risks as seeking abortion in darkness
VUXpU_vnNYE,i remember people like mitch mcconnell screaming about how he fears activist judges
VUXpU_vnNYE,thank you for your report
VUXpU_vnNYE,another night to regret switching on the news about our country no matter whos reading the teleprompter
VUXpU_vnNYE,sad to say this country is going downhill every day
VUXpU_vnNYE,usa never fail to disappoint the world good job
VUXpU_vnNYE,its beautiful  abortion is not a constitutional right if we cant receive medical treatment without a cost
VUXpU_vnNYE,nonphysicians will be allowed to provide abortions wait what lmao nbc just glossed over that one go back and explain that
VUXpU_vnNYE,so are all of those people against abortion going to step up and adopt every unwanted child born
VUXpU_vnNYE,so much for a free country
VUXpU_vnNYE,the courts decision to allow a right to conceal carry guns might cause a shooter to get shot down by fellow citizensa  positive change
VUXpU_vnNYE,its like they are mad they dont have the chance  to get aids come on ladies let them know you have the right to do what you feel
VUXpU_vnNYE,on one hand i believe in the sanctity of life  but on the other hand there are fates worse than death
VUXpU_vnNYE,well the supreme court should no longer be able to change precedence
VUXpU_vnNYE,problem is last 50 years congress failed to codify abortion in uk for example the parliament set abortion at 24 weeks long ago nationwide
VUXpU_vnNYE,i cant believe one of the justices is considering overturning rights to contraception this is ridiculous
VUXpU_vnNYE,ive seen people load up on the dependency check and then they say theyre republicans
VUXpU_vnNYE,i take bets no one ever received as much stuff as our zelyki
VUXpU_vnNYE,people keeping their pants on if they dont want a child will help a lot
VUXpU_vnNYE,whether the court was wrong or right today will go down in history
VUXpU_vnNYE,make america the 80s again
VUXpU_vnNYE,clearance thomas and his wife have no soul may they reap what they sow
VUXpU_vnNYE,someone you know and love has had an abortion learn some humility and compassion
VUXpU_vnNYE,today is monumental now lets see if we can also honor life by passing universal healthcare universal basic income and a living wage
VUXpU_vnNYE,why practice democracy if its going to take 30 years to make a significant change
VUXpU_vnNYE,if people claim to be true libertarians you would not try to go out of your way to block someone getting an abortion   it is a womans right
VUXpU_vnNYE,abortion affects more than just the mother
VUXpU_vnNYE,when the gop chanted lock her up they meant it
VUXpU_vnNYE,a termination or an unplanned unwanted unwilling inpregnation
VUXpU_vnNYE,no more one night stands and fellas its time to wrap it up
VUXpU_vnNYE,so when the justices said while they were being confirmed that they would not overturn roe versus wade they lied
VUXpU_vnNYE,great news for the unborn children they deserve to live god has won and the devil has lost may the bless our supreme court
VUXpU_vnNYE,so much bs 50 yr and the law has change for what reasonpolitical bs does not make sense
VUXpU_vnNYE,how crazy
VUXpU_vnNYE,next decision we need  from this supreme court  allow clarence uncle thomas dissolve all interatrial marriages for what is gods christian justice tell ginny she has to go
VUXpU_vnNYE,what an amazing way to end pride month
VUXpU_vnNYE,roe and wade gets overturned yesterday for the good i wonder whats going to be next in time
VUXpU_vnNYE,how about overturning the right to bear arms  how many lives would that save
VUXpU_vnNYE,i read a lot in the comment section if you are so much of prolife why not taking care of all children placed for adoption
VUXpU_vnNYE,i like the abort the court sign you see at
VUXpU_vnNYE,sad day for american and most of its women
VUXpU_vnNYE,and we are proud to do abortion she says waaaaaao
VUXpU_vnNYE,what a crazy country we live in i suppose in the future we will only be allowed one child because there will be to many
VUXpU_vnNYE,choices by americans will always be debated
VUXpU_vnNYE,red flag laws violate both 
VUXpU_vnNYE,all i can do is shake my head
VUXpU_vnNYE,mother of unwanted child needs to sue one of these states for child support

_t4ru1_xAH4,do you think the ipad 10 will get a full redesign comment below
_t4ru1_xAH4,whats funny is they could legit just re release the ipad air 4 as ipad 10
_t4ru1_xAH4,could definitely see them doing the upgrade now since they have created the differentiation with the m1 requirement for stage manager to limit the loss of air sales
_t4ru1_xAH4,this could be a game changing device even at 399 it is such a deal with the specs and hardware it will be interesting to see if this actually happens
_t4ru1_xAH4,a big concern of this redesign though is a 35mm headphone jack which i still frequently use nowadays
_t4ru1_xAH4,i love the feel of the first gen apple pencil
_t4ru1_xAH4,ipad air 3 design is likely to be next there are rumors on both 2022 or 2023 however
_t4ru1_xAH4,i think it would get a redesign due to usb c and larger display an old design like that cant keep those implementations
_t4ru1_xAH4,i like the bezel design coz it is easy to grip it with one hand and that design language is so much rigid than the new design
_t4ru1_xAH4,heres my prediction for the ipad 10th generation specs
_t4ru1_xAH4,bigger bezels  stereo sound and etched glass screen thats what i want  even with a12 
_t4ru1_xAH4,for them it is not really a redesign they just reuse the parts from other ipads  the price bump is not justified 
_t4ru1_xAH4,im shuddering with anticipation to see if that design comes on the 10
_t4ru1_xAH4,hopefully the budget ipad gets usbc this year
_t4ru1_xAH4,damn i was thinking of getting the 9th generation but i guess im going to hold off
_t4ru1_xAH4,id hope they keep the design and add pro motion rather than redesign and keep a 60hz panel i know its not gonna happen lol
_t4ru1_xAH4,yay i want my next ipad to upgrade 8th gen to 10th xth gen if it get redesigned
_t4ru1_xAH4,what about the rumored 14 ipad  pro or not any new rumors about it that might indicate how likely this will be
_t4ru1_xAH4,i was ready to buy the 9 and now i need to wait til september  useful info thanks
_t4ru1_xAH4,apple wouldnt sell many ipad airs when the ipad 10 or x will get the same disign
_t4ru1_xAH4,the redesign is something i think they should really consider due to the flaws
_t4ru1_xAH4,i really hope apple considers miniled to be the future over oled and give the cheapest ipads models oled  i would buy it with zero hesitation
_t4ru1_xAH4,i wonder chip will eventually use in the next iteration of the budget ipad
_t4ru1_xAH4,smaller bezels improved chips  new color options boom
_t4ru1_xAH4,depends if they keep touch id or not extremely useful for me
_t4ru1_xAH4,probably they are gonna remove the home button and headphone jack and make it more expensive like with the mini better buy now
_t4ru1_xAH4,i really wish those events would be between july  august rather than september  october
_t4ru1_xAH4,i brought the ipad 9th with 256gb storage last month for 350 on amazon mx i couldnt resist
_t4ru1_xAH4,im pretty sure they gonna keep the design just upgrade the cpu gpu thats it
_t4ru1_xAH4,laminated display is the  1 feature on my wish list
_t4ru1_xAH4,the a13 chip is really powerful i think
_t4ru1_xAH4,literally every college student waiting for this ipad
_t4ru1_xAH4,i think ipad 10 will come with boxy ipad pro design but with home button and top and bottom bezel
_t4ru1_xAH4,usbc 128gb base varient 2nd gen pencil support thats all i wanted on current ipad 9 otherwise the device is perfect as it is
_t4ru1_xAH4,i was debating to buy the ipad 9 but now that i saw this in my recommended i think its a sign telling me to wait
_t4ru1_xAH4,too late i just bought an ipad air 5 haha
_t4ru1_xAH4,i really hope the ipad 10 gets a redesign
_t4ru1_xAH4,apple courteously offers to smash and recycle any ipad 9th gen in their tradein program  so dont plan on trading one in
_t4ru1_xAH4,last month i got my brand new ipad 9 256gb from ebay for just 360
_t4ru1_xAH4,laminated display and apple pencil 2 support these two are in my wish list
_t4ru1_xAH4,if that happens i will assume the price will jump up to 429449 however if they stick to the ipad air 3 design then the price could stay about 329349
_t4ru1_xAH4,i dont think the ipad 10 will get its own magic keyboard because the current one should fit as that whats gonna make it 105 would be the fat bezels
_t4ru1_xAH4,i would really like the ipad to be redesigned  but i already have an apple pencil 1 and dont wanna buy pencil 2 im torn
_t4ru1_xAH4,i think they will just put the 102 or 105 screen inside the body of the airpro to make it compatible with the existing magic keyboard case
_t4ru1_xAH4,if that happen its gonna kill the ipad mini v because of the price and the size so i dont think they gonna do that 
_t4ru1_xAH4,great video i just bought the ipad 9 with 256gb just two days ago and so far its really good
_t4ru1_xAH4,i think the ipad ten will have bezel reduction and a removed home button or some new colors they might also call it ipad x
_t4ru1_xAH4,genuine reviews and honest opinions everything apple this channel is good
_t4ru1_xAH4,thanks for the info because i am thinking of buying one for my university studies
_t4ru1_xAH4,itll be a hot potato when it comes out itll be so inexpensive everyone can afford one or two protecting the market is a cunning path to prosperity
_t4ru1_xAH4,you hit the nail on the head  usb c is fragile  great observation about the flat sided chassis which also sucks  thanks eu
_t4ru1_xAH4,i beg the design will remain the same just upgrading the cpu and usbc port may be apple will be kind enough to come with laminated screen
_t4ru1_xAH4,its worth waiting
_t4ru1_xAH4,there is a massive air gap in screen of old model it should be removed to use new and thta is not possible design
_t4ru1_xAH4,so if lightning style port is more sturdy than the usbc why is everyone switching to that style instead of upping the lightning speed
_t4ru1_xAH4,will stick with the mini 5 i picked up for 75 at a rummage its more than capable tested the mini 6 before getting this could stand it
_t4ru1_xAH4,if we compare the ipad series to iphone series
_t4ru1_xAH4,lets all appreciate what this guy has done for us
_t4ru1_xAH4,im waiting for m2 ipad pro hope it keeps the current design so i can use the magic kb i already have
_t4ru1_xAH4,your analysis was reasonable i hope redesign too
_t4ru1_xAH4,if its getting a14 chip and air 3 design just get the air 4 if u dont mind missing out on stage manager and center stage
_t4ru1_xAH4,ipad10  air3 otherwise who would buy an air5  plus apple usually upgrade the base ipad incrementally
_t4ru1_xAH4,will we finally get a laminated display anything else may not be that important
_t4ru1_xAH4,its about time the budget ipad got a redesign so yea i really want it
_t4ru1_xAH4,this just makes me frustrated and sad for getting the 9th gen ipad
_t4ru1_xAH4,would the ipad 10th gen be better or the ipad air 4 if both are the same price
_t4ru1_xAH4,should i buy air 4 now im getting around 40k inr for gaming

YINDdVBAP7o,i work as a food delivery driver in london and can tell you that people buy less and less food
YINDdVBAP7o,this is planned  im sure im not the only one who thinks this
YINDdVBAP7o,the global hunger games by design
YINDdVBAP7o,a special thanks to all the climate alarmists and war mongers for this manmade disaster
YINDdVBAP7o,we cannot prevent what is coming but we can prepare to brace ourselves for whats coming shtf
YINDdVBAP7o,this is going to be a hard winter
YINDdVBAP7o,went to our local beefeater restaurant for a family occasion recently
YINDdVBAP7o,money spent predominately on reducing human life and livestock we really are the carbon they want to reduce
YINDdVBAP7o,its worrying the sheer amount of people that are asleep to whats happening globally and to how it could actually impact them
YINDdVBAP7o,im worried too neil  this is not only frightening but as you well made the case for here it isnt necessary  brace everyone
YINDdVBAP7o,slowly prepping week by week buying a little extra food on the food shop my mrs thinks im crazy

YINDdVBAP7o,whats more alarming is shops mainly grocery shops that have been around for decades are closing stock up people because things look like they will get worse
YINDdVBAP7o,its a good job bill gates has bought all that farm land i was really worried he might not get enough to eat

YINDdVBAP7o,make sure you all get in shape stock up on vitamins stock up on the things you dont think about like aspirin tylenol
YINDdVBAP7o,it is concerning the food scarcity england has forgotten that prior to sugar and processed foods mcdonalds and instant snacks the population was slim trim and healthy
YINDdVBAP7o,breaks my heart when people buy less food they are out of funds
YINDdVBAP7o,food shortages are designed to make people easier to control when people are hungry its going to be a bad time to be an overweight politician
YINDdVBAP7o,what was the first thing that uk politicians did in lock downgive themselves 10ooo pay increase but we are all in this together
YINDdVBAP7o,so far all ive seen is a lot of talk and warnings from the same entities that hyped covid fear im starting to question if this isnt a psyop
YINDdVBAP7o,after hearing all the countries you listed off that were suffering serious food shortages i couldnt help but notice that they all seem to have one thing in common
YINDdVBAP7o,its hard to press the like button after all this bad news thank you for the information
YINDdVBAP7o,once again brilliant informative update neil you always cover everything and say it so well thank you
YINDdVBAP7o,the shortages are all deliberate
YINDdVBAP7o,when the food was allowed to rot in shipping containers  that was as sure giveaway of the criminality we are witnessing
YINDdVBAP7o,does anyone remember lady gaga wearing an exact replica of an outfit from hunger games at bidens inauguration they are doing it on purpose and they are laughing at you
YINDdVBAP7o,as people have less accsess to basic needs you will see crime skyrocket
YINDdVBAP7o,self employed folk rarely get a pay riseus delivery drivers are worse off every yearsick of these moaning money grabbers wasting it on nexflix or sky bollox
YINDdVBAP7o,saw an article about uk energy suppliers planning on paying domestic customers
YINDdVBAP7o,how is a scarcity of food going to blend with diversity i wonder
YINDdVBAP7o,on a visit to the ritz last week with my 11 children i was amazed that are bill was  15000 
YINDdVBAP7o,hows that global debtbased economy working out
YINDdVBAP7o,im very concerned about energy im stocking up on tin foods i blocked my fireplace a few years back im regretting it now is it possible to have it reopened

nUZCE40n2zg,great video as always fast pasted with a lot of food and humour  what more do you want  just subscribed
nUZCE40n2zg,damn all the dishes look so good and delicious literally all
nUZCE40n2zg,im from the uk and i can confirm whenever i go out for a meal i religiously eat sticky toffee pudding best dessert going
nUZCE40n2zg,with fish and chips in britain a staple is curry sauce usually its a gravy type curry sauce rather than a mayo but its a killer combo
nUZCE40n2zg,i love this guy and the way he says youre fired to manny makes me burst out laughing
nUZCE40n2zg,i dont eat sweets much but that sticky toffee pudding looks and sounds delicous
nUZCE40n2zg,great episode really enjoyed it in the uk most people have curry sauce and mayo but separately but mix it together are selfs as it comes in separate pots mostly
nUZCE40n2zg,ah yes eating lunch while watching nick videos is the way to go 3
nUZCE40n2zg,oh man i want some of that sticky toffee pudding  everytime gordon mentions it im drooling like manny lol kidding luv ya manny
nUZCE40n2zg,when i saw the title i was like damn this man must be broke by now
nUZCE40n2zg,nick i miss the 1525 minute videos especially of you just cooking something delicious in your house
nUZCE40n2zg,imagine if nick is gordon ramsays employee and miss up i dont even know what will happen
nUZCE40n2zg,sometimes i wont bite the chili and just swallow it that way just my stomach hurts  why did that get me
nUZCE40n2zg,finallymanny actually gets to try some of the food
nUZCE40n2zg,its funny to see an american react to british food also im 90 sure the curried mayonnaise is tartar sauce
nUZCE40n2zg,i love it when nick makes food review videos keep up the good work big boy
nUZCE40n2zg,manny just happy to be there when he mixed the drinks i felt that on a spiritual level

nUZCE40n2zg,when i saw the title i was like damn this man must be broke by now eating the best food cooked by the best chef
nUZCE40n2zg,we need a spicy food challenge
nUZCE40n2zg,its always been my dream as a 15 year old to cook with a great chef like you or gordon
nUZCE40n2zg,nick never fails to make me hungry in every video
nUZCE40n2zg,ive been to the exact same hells kitchen and the salmon was just crazy good

EaRhaLhhakw,i would love to hear some tech news riley thank you
EaRhaLhhakw,riley is so charismatic he can carry a whole episode with no heckler
EaRhaLhhakw,thanks for the shoutout hoping apple releases an update so i can download another nand chip to speed up my storage thats how it works right
EaRhaLhhakw,that would actually make so much sense for cyberpunk im wondering if the stadia team did some bug hunting themselves when porting cause that version ran so so well
EaRhaLhhakw,finally someone who understands my burning need for tech news
EaRhaLhhakw,switch to google chat and await further instructions i laughed way out loud at that one ty so this brilliant writing behind this
EaRhaLhhakw,rileys energy is like a ray of sun that lights up my day
EaRhaLhhakw,apple calling things pro has always been a joke they slap that on whatever they want to get people to pay more for it
EaRhaLhhakw,riley is one of the greatest things i cherish these days can make me smirk like an idiot everytime he does the tech news
EaRhaLhhakw,now im scared that youll need to buy 2tb of storage to get the same speed as the m1 macbook
EaRhaLhhakw,so basically if you want the m2 chip that badly wait for the macbook air redesign
EaRhaLhhakw,on the flip side m3 might bring along a 50 increase in storage speed mind blowing
EaRhaLhhakw,i wouldnt go so far as to call cyberpunk2077 the thing it doesnt go so far is to not have voice actors and filled with microtransactions
EaRhaLhhakw,always love the tech news when its riley what a treat
EaRhaLhhakw,little known fact m2 macs can be put into m2 slots if you have a large enough case  truly apple priced storage
EaRhaLhhakw,i find it funny how companies like apple work or all tech companies for that matter
EaRhaLhhakw,dont mess with your steam deck meanwhile linus slaps a heatsink on the back for cooling
EaRhaLhhakw,the 2022 m2 macbook pros ssd is also 33 slower than my basemodel 2017 i5 macbook pro nontouchbar
EaRhaLhhakw,if i had a dime everytime riley said tech news itd be rich right now
EaRhaLhhakw,love the shout out to max tech they are doing great work over there
EaRhaLhhakw,ueg is really underrated love that guys work
EaRhaLhhakw,for the 7000x3d variant why amd they could just put 3d vcache into existing zen 4 cpus
EaRhaLhhakw,i would love to use my gpu as a extra processer and use the pci lanes as a handler of a lot of the data
EaRhaLhhakw,i always wonder if there is going to be tech news pro or quick bits renamed to tech news mini
EaRhaLhhakw,apple called spending 5000 on a nonupgradeable allinone machine with a faulty vesa mount adapter that breaks when you try to install it having to rely on
EaRhaLhhakw,riley james i love you guys
EaRhaLhhakw,thanks for uploads at this time perfect to eat breakfast and satisfy myself with the latest tech news
EaRhaLhhakw,the steam deck teardown video was a mess
EaRhaLhhakw,thank you riley you always know what i want
EaRhaLhhakw,if youre buying a base model pro youre probably not looking for insane storage speeds anyway
EaRhaLhhakw,chapter title should read m2 ssd half as fast as m1s half as slow is faster
EaRhaLhhakw,good to see cdp practicing the washing hands sop
EaRhaLhhakw,riley low key is my favorite person i wish i wasnt in nova scotia and we could be friends and watch compilations of ned flanders together
EaRhaLhhakw,im curious if a 1 gb cpu cache is possible because i found that 100 mb is already ridiculous
EaRhaLhhakw,on a side note the thing the video game for original xbox was a one hella fun game in my childhood it terrified me to no end
EaRhaLhhakw,the mans got jokes the mans got jokes loved it sir murdock
EaRhaLhhakw,riley knows a surprising amount about vaping lol
EaRhaLhhakw,imagine if riley was on fiver and could be paid to make a video like this on any subject
EaRhaLhhakw,wow took 21 minutes for my notification to come through
EaRhaLhhakw,i wonder if the ai riley will be better than the real one
EaRhaLhhakw,13 inch macbook pro should be macbook or fancy air because it has a fan
EaRhaLhhakw,apple could solve the slow storage drives by making their computers user upgradable again
EaRhaLhhakw,nothing like waking up to read the tech news in the mornin
EaRhaLhhakw,use it for your whole esports career and return it im dying lol
EaRhaLhhakw,google shutting down most of their chat services might mean their gonna focus on rcs messaging
EaRhaLhhakw,thumbs up if you want to see them make an arm and a leg joke the next time they cover apples m2
EaRhaLhhakw,having 2 kids now anytime i see gamer chairs i chuckle because they look exactly like my toddlers car seats
EaRhaLhhakw,gotta love the apple magic
EaRhaLhhakw,would def love some right about now
EaRhaLhhakw,where there is tech news the tech newsers will follow
EaRhaLhhakw,didnt watch orygina movie but if valve shows con you can maintain your deck and replace ssd for never one in future then yes great idea
EaRhaLhhakw,theres never enough riley in my riley ya feel me
EaRhaLhhakw,good thing you can just switch out that ssd in the m2 for a better one  
EaRhaLhhakw,the gadgets are here i need tech news not a ride
EaRhaLhhakw,you can almost use it for your whole esports career and return it after
EaRhaLhhakw,just give me the tech news man you know im good for it
EaRhaLhhakw,i cant wait for all of my communications to be approved by the corporations
EaRhaLhhakw,it makes no sense how is the ai supposed to learn how to get hold of diamonds when all the mining happens offcamera
EaRhaLhhakw,i found myself interjecting absurdities at riley between stories because james wasnt around to heckle him properly
EaRhaLhhakw,imagine they trained that ai to make a redstone ai
EaRhaLhhakw,the best tech presenter on youtube riley
EaRhaLhhakw,its not really a mystery how cyberpunk was a complete mess it basically boils down to horrible management and trying to save money by outsourcing crucial parts of development
EaRhaLhhakw,yes give it to me give me the tech news riley
EaRhaLhhakw,cyberpunk 2077 is one of my favourite games had less bugs in it than witcher 3 lol
EaRhaLhhakw,you can use it for your whole esport career and return it later  oof burned 
EaRhaLhhakw,i wouldnt want to be caught at school with a smok
EaRhaLhhakw,half as slow means 50 faster should probably fix that chapter marker
EaRhaLhhakw,i love tech news riley gave me a shoutout at the end
EaRhaLhhakw,i would show how much i love tech news however i dont want justin to freeze my bank account
EaRhaLhhakw,oh damn that plug to my favourite movie podcast was smooth as heck

bUmULlGACEI,a literal genius asking what is omg is exactly the situation i needed to see
bUmULlGACEI,dr kaku theres no such thing as a dumb question
bUmULlGACEI,he gave me more knowledge in 16 minutes than my physics teacher did in 6 years
bUmULlGACEI,i used to see this guy on every space and universe documentary in the 2000s glad hes still going full swing
bUmULlGACEI,he teaches at my university and hes so kind and humble always such a character
bUmULlGACEI,einstein is a really intelligent dude he should try his career in physics or something
bUmULlGACEI,he is so genius that even the omg was beyond for his learning
bUmULlGACEI,hes such a great science communicator were lucky to have him
bUmULlGACEI,theres no such thing as dumb question i hope a lot of people especially teachers understand this
bUmULlGACEI,i remember watching this guy on various astronomy shows on the science channel good to know hes still well and sharing what he loves with the masses
bUmULlGACEI,this dude has the most stereotypical scientist hair and i love it
bUmULlGACEI,michio kaku newton is my favore physicist
bUmULlGACEI,dr michio kaku explain every question in easy way
bUmULlGACEI,the knowledge in this dude is insane imagine breaking it up so down to the simplest form for us to understand shows you how much he knows
bUmULlGACEI,string theory could not be more simplified than this
bUmULlGACEI,i started watching this guys shows and videos when i was 11
bUmULlGACEI,the god equation looks like a good setup for a scifi adventure story something that is barely beyond reach but never grasp
bUmULlGACEI,the guy who answered it is oh my god must feel so proud of having taught dr kaku something he will brag about that until the end of his days
bUmULlGACEI,i teared up when he said theres no such thing as dumb question
bUmULlGACEI,dr kaku is amazing in explaining the toughest concepts of physics
bUmULlGACEI,how beautifully he answered every question with so simple explanation that even the toughest physics concept seemed so obvious and logical i wish i had a physics teacher like him
bUmULlGACEI,that was amaaaaaazing im so glad he is a teacher he is the best one i have ever seen
bUmULlGACEI,there are two types of people
bUmULlGACEI,seems like a great guy i love this series everyone in it is well spoken
bUmULlGACEI,hes one of the only physicist that i understood love how he explains all these concepts
bUmULlGACEI,imagine having him as ur science teacher i would legit listen to him
bUmULlGACEI,i am ready to give him ten years of my life really people like him should always live
bUmULlGACEI,birds fly not because they flap their wings
bUmULlGACEI,i love this man used to spend hours watching documentaries with him on it
bUmULlGACEI,incredibly inspirational thought provoking and the last lines were very touching im glad im alive at this age where knowledge is shared and encouraged
bUmULlGACEI,hope our physics tutor will be like dr michio kaku
bUmULlGACEI,a strange pain hits seeing such genius getting old
bUmULlGACEI,i watched michio on the science channel growing up i love him hes so smart and explains things easily so you can actually absorb it
bUmULlGACEI,i love this guy brain cox and jim alkhalili
bUmULlGACEI,he has easily always been my favorite scientist he explains things so well and his excitement just ups ur interest even more such a great man
bUmULlGACEI,finally understand dark matter because of this man ive been trying to get it for so long and he made it make sense in like 20 seconds
bUmULlGACEI,he is so smart he can actually make you understand things that are so daunting to comprehend
bUmULlGACEI,dr michio kaku is incredible humble and so good at explaining  ive become a total geek after i discovered him 10 years ago
bUmULlGACEI,i wish i had a physics professor like him he explained physics so clearly that i suddenly love it
bUmULlGACEI,you know youre a brilliant physicist when you dont even know what omg means
bUmULlGACEI,i love how he answers extreme tough and easy questions in the same manner
bUmULlGACEI,what a great guy a tremendous communicator
bUmULlGACEI,he didnt have the mathematics to calculate the fall what did he do he invented his own mathematics i couldnt stop laughing
bUmULlGACEI,i loved this episode he explains things so well  hope to have another episode 
bUmULlGACEI,i love the kind of teacher like him very passionate about the subject and happy to teach you more
bUmULlGACEI,he explains everything in such an easy way i love this man
bUmULlGACEI,i like michio he is very enthusiastic and explains things easily he has great knowledge and i found his books amazing check his books out
bUmULlGACEI,he is such a chill person honoured to see him answering all these questions and making understand in a simple manner
bUmULlGACEI,he explains things so simply that we all understand easily
bUmULlGACEI,michio kaku is that one grandpa everybody loves even the neighbors
bUmULlGACEI,i love this man his explanations are so clear
bUmULlGACEI,he has so much passion in physics and a constant smile throughout the whole video
bUmULlGACEI,its still baffles me to this day that mathematics can explain basically everything
bUmULlGACEI,isaac newton is such a chad
bUmULlGACEI,i love how happy he was when he said string theory was the closest  we have the god equation
bUmULlGACEI,my main take away is theres no such thing as a dumb question  live long shifu kaku
bUmULlGACEI,its really nice to see someone extremely passionate towards something
bUmULlGACEI,question does individual objects like glass have their own field of gravity considering light bends through objects as well as gravity
bUmULlGACEI,such a brilliant man i just listened every word he said in awe
bUmULlGACEI,in my language kaku is an affectionate way to say uncle so hes instantly uncle michio to a bengali person
bUmULlGACEI,this man is magnificent i wish that i had a chance to speak with him in person at some point
bUmULlGACEI,i was always so happy to catch the show with him on discovery science or whatever channel with all the space and wormhole stuff
bUmULlGACEI,michio kaku great guy my favorite professor of theoretical physics he is amazing
bUmULlGACEI,my science teacher gave me one of his books and i was absolutely amazed i almost fell out of my chair when i saw that it was him
bUmULlGACEI,if he was my teacher in highschool physics would have been enjoyable rather than boring
bUmULlGACEI,i absolutely enjoyed watching it
bUmULlGACEI,he know every bit of physics and asks what is omg
bUmULlGACEI,what is an omg
bUmULlGACEI,michio kaku knows practically everything there is to know about physics and life itself
bUmULlGACEI,first time listening to this guy and i didnt want it to stop hes awesome
bUmULlGACEI,its nice to see this guy again on wired
bUmULlGACEI,who cares about other physicchemistry teachers when you can understand dr michio kaku a lot better than school provided
bUmULlGACEI,im here to prepare how to explain physics in the most engaging way possible to my future kid
bUmULlGACEI,imagine being one of the greatest physicist in the world containing so much  knowledge that only a few have  and not knowing what does omg mean
bUmULlGACEI,i enjoy this show so much i can feel like im getting smarter thank you
bUmULlGACEI,when he talks about the invisibility part that is so cool had no idea light could do that but it makes sense
bUmULlGACEI,no matter how smart you are theres always something you dont know  what is omg
bUmULlGACEI,listening to dr kaku discuss physics makes me smile
bUmULlGACEI,this video just summerized my whole high school physics in 16 minsand i understood more than i ever did in high school
bUmULlGACEI,please do more physics support with dr michio kaku again 
bUmULlGACEI,well he did not really answered the first question he still a genius
bUmULlGACEI,i feel like learning something new for today and sometimes recalled the old knowlodge nice to meet you professor kaku
bUmULlGACEI,i love how he explains things in the most simplistic way possible so that everyone can understand
bUmULlGACEI,i never heard about dr michio kaku but now i love him and of course i want to share the nobel prize with you
bUmULlGACEI,its wild that i took his class some semesters ago and only now im learning that hes famoussheesh i had the best time in his class too thank you professor
CCc5xfFiz8k,ive never truly been a fan of actually having a creature in the back rooms to me it ruins the uncertainty
CCc5xfFiz8k,not only is habie hilarious with horror but hes just funny in general
CCc5xfFiz8k,i never knew that watching habie develop a phobia of doors could be so fun but here i am
CCc5xfFiz8k,i kind of miss when the backrooms was just mysterious but i still love what many creators are doing with the idea mainly kane pixels p cool looking game
CCc5xfFiz8k,you made walking through a hallway entertaining and for that i applaud you
CCc5xfFiz8k,wow last time i was this early my wife got dissapointed
CCc5xfFiz8k,i love this content habie im glad your content has been entertaining since i first started watching you
CCc5xfFiz8k,habie playing a horror game in vr is the funniest shit ever
CCc5xfFiz8k,the closest i will ever come to playing the backrooms in vr is the backrooms onward map because anything else will make me have a heart attack
CCc5xfFiz8k,watching this while camping watching in 144p adds to the experience lol
CCc5xfFiz8k,you were wrong with pretty much everything about the origin of the backrooms but this game looks awesome
CCc5xfFiz8k,i love that he talks about scp in past tense like its not still a thing
CCc5xfFiz8k,4 that texturing and lighting is great for that price and the gameplay is amazing
CCc5xfFiz8k,amnesia dark descent needs to be modded with updated graphics and a vr port that game would be amazing in vr and backrooms is proof of that
CCc5xfFiz8k,the idea of being stuck in an infinite neverending room is scary enough that and its now in vr
CCc5xfFiz8k,this is one of my fav vr channels hes funny and fun to watch keep it up and i think everyone agrees
CCc5xfFiz8k,loving the content habie been watching for over a year now and still loving it 
CCc5xfFiz8k,funnily enough i think habie not knowing what the backrooms are is probably truer to the spirit of the backrooms
CCc5xfFiz8k,habie thanks for the weekly laughs mate
CCc5xfFiz8k,thank you for not taking this opportunity to jump scare me im watching this at 230 am
CCc5xfFiz8k,you should 100 be hired to narrate videos voice sounds goes along with the videos so nicely
CCc5xfFiz8k,the backrooms are basically the parts of our existence that the devs didnt finish before launch like the inaccessible rooms in half life
CCc5xfFiz8k,that was tame compared to the rest of the backrooms lore i hope i get to play first good looking backrooms game
CCc5xfFiz8k,ive been waiting to try this and its finally out cant wait
CCc5xfFiz8k,kane pixels is a great youtube creator for the backrooms some seriously quality videos building up the word of the bacrooms have come out of that channel
CCc5xfFiz8k,great video keep up the great work habie
CCc5xfFiz8k,the most cursed thing is that theres no bathroom in the backrooms
CCc5xfFiz8k,always a good day when habie posts
CCc5xfFiz8k,the framerate on this one is rough
CCc5xfFiz8k,thanks habbie for distracting me today i had a wedding for some people i hate and this brought up my sprits
CCc5xfFiz8k,i got this game too and i also couldnt find anything online and this is one of the 2 videos i found about this specific game
CCc5xfFiz8k,i bought this game on the first day it came out unknowingly it is so freakin hard dude
CCc5xfFiz8k,hello habie and friendsi hope yall have a wonderful rest of your day
CCc5xfFiz8k,now by recording vr gameplay a shit ton more found footage backroom videos will appear on yt
CCc5xfFiz8k,hable id highly recommend looking for the channel backrooms explained if youd like to learn more about the lore behind this
CCc5xfFiz8k,i wish so badly that at
CCc5xfFiz8k,in the backrooms the texture glitches of the walls and monsters limbs sticking through walls makes it even more unnerving
CCc5xfFiz8k,it seems most of this stuff is actually from officialwidely accepted backrooms lore like the dog things and the sirenhead looking fungus creatures
CCc5xfFiz8k,crazy thing is that this game goes like 1 into backrooms lore
CCc5xfFiz8k,i dont think the person who made this quite gets the concept of backrooms
CCc5xfFiz8k,hey habie im coming from the future and im just here to tell you congratulations on 1m subs you deserve it
CCc5xfFiz8k,i wonder if this will ever become multiplayer
CCc5xfFiz8k,i cant even handle the backrooms maps in vrchat theres no way in hell i can play this game this looks terrifying
CCc5xfFiz8k,yyeesssss i can always count on you to find the best of vr games
CCc5xfFiz8k,for excellent videos about actually being in the backrooms check the backroomsfound footage by kane pixels
CCc5xfFiz8k,that was a fun stream
CCc5xfFiz8k,trust me  the more you know about the backrooms the scarier it is
CCc5xfFiz8k,id love a game based on the mystery flesh pit national park
CCc5xfFiz8k,a video about a horror game uploads late at night this is perfectly fine
CCc5xfFiz8k,you should try alien isolation with the vr mod  its absolutely terrifying
CCc5xfFiz8k,really wild to play a game and nobody played it first to help you along
CCc5xfFiz8k,i really cant understand how 46 people would dislike the content from the most humble youtuber ever
CCc5xfFiz8k,imagine playing this game and taking off the headset only to still be in the back rooms
CCc5xfFiz8k,another amazing video from the pig god himself
CCc5xfFiz8k,ha theres bo way your gonna be able to do this game in just 1 day this thing is  goes so deep
QW3KRaz4aI4,i love watching people talk about something that theyre passionate about
QW3KRaz4aI4,yeah we are gonna need a 3 hour version of this thank you extremely interesting subject and great explanations
QW3KRaz4aI4,i love his use of the out of how many error really mindblowing that the ladys own attorney couldnt come up with this defense for her
QW3KRaz4aI4,i took a probability class my senior year of college absolutely phenomenal insight into how the world operates
QW3KRaz4aI4,i saw this guy live along with other stats titans of our era truly inspirational stuff
QW3KRaz4aI4,this was one of my favorite professors at university of toronto i took stochastic processes with him i thought i recognized him
QW3KRaz4aI4,this is absolutely wonderful i can tell hes a great professor the way he can explain things but really be full of passion for what hes talking about 
QW3KRaz4aI4,extremely useful very precise straight forward and every question is very well explained thank you
QW3KRaz4aI4,i love how genuinely passionate this guy is along with his eloquence to explain complicated equations in simple terms
QW3KRaz4aI4,i wish my statistics teacher was like him i could have learned a lot more
QW3KRaz4aI4,someone should have asked how statisticians define luck
QW3KRaz4aI4,love this series looking forwards to learning more 
QW3KRaz4aI4,i used to do political polling and agreement to do the poll it was
QW3KRaz4aI4,that was genuinely entertaining and educating i watched 100 of the runtime
QW3KRaz4aI4,rosenthal should be brought back not only because hes engaging and delightful but because statistics is one of the most misunderstood or neglected fields

VTEhYwtjTjo,love a sunseeker but must say they are really taking their builds to the next level thanks again nick cheers
VTEhYwtjTjo,ive seen this boat on other channels for several times but everyone of them passed on the covert crew cabin  again nick didnt let me down on that
VTEhYwtjTjo,this is a lovely boat also love your sense of humour the only thing that my boat has in common with this one is that it floats 
VTEhYwtjTjo,now thats quite a lay out on this one love the idea of everyone having their own head very pretty yacht thank you nick

3GNoelvk6S4,thank you for covering this whoever in your team recommended talking about oneplus  thank you
3GNoelvk6S4,you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain  oneplus
3GNoelvk6S4,my op7 was the best software experience ive ever had in a phone and would still gladly use it if i wasnt in a position to buy a fold 3
3GNoelvk6S4,you either die a hero well you know where this ones going
3GNoelvk6S4,absolutely loved my oneplus 7 pro and i miss it to this day that full unhindered screen was a game changer
3GNoelvk6S4,well said long time oneplus user here or rather
3GNoelvk6S4,i love this format having different people tell their problem hope we see more of yvonne in future videos
3GNoelvk6S4,the oneplus 3 was a beast and at a sweat spot between price and features i loved that phone
3GNoelvk6S4,wow great video lmg
3GNoelvk6S4,this is so true thank you for talking about it linus
3GNoelvk6S4,oneplus have lost their identity that much is clear i also remember getting the oneplus 3 i was truly amazed with it unfortunate how theyve gone downhill
3GNoelvk6S4,while the price is what initially got me into oneplus the software was what sold me on it
3GNoelvk6S4,had a 7 pro and was so excited to buy a 9 pro but some bugs have become increasingly frustrating like youtube or google maps minimized functions losing functionality
3GNoelvk6S4,i have been fortunate enough to use the oneplus one 3 3t 6 and 7t absolutely loved each and every one of those phones really the golden age of android
3GNoelvk6S4,always blows my mind when people speak wistfully of the one plus one a phone with endless qa issues causing unusable touch screens that one plus refused to rma
3GNoelvk6S4,went from a oneplus 5t to the 7 pro im ready to upgrade but theres nothing compelling out there from android that fills the void left by oneplus
3GNoelvk6S4,im still using my 7 pro to this day and frankly until something completely mindblowing comes from oneplus or any other brand tbh i have no desire to upgrade
3GNoelvk6S4,after my 7 pro updated beyond android 10 it was a fast descent in performance and stability its never been the same since
3GNoelvk6S4,i have had 12 and 6t
3GNoelvk6S4,i drove the op 7t mcclaren for 2 years  2 earlier generations before that  i believe my mcclaren was definitely peak op and everything afterward has been undoubtedly a letdown
3GNoelvk6S4,i loved my oneplus one back in the day amazing phone sad to see the downfall
3GNoelvk6S4,i really liked the breakdown and the testimonies i could see this being a semiregular series when the opportunity arises

wFqQm1541aA,i remember hearing someone say theres not a shortage of teachers theres a shortage of masters level professionals willing to be paid 35000
wFqQm1541aA,in finland school teacher is a highly valued occupation the joke isnt why arent you a doctor or a lawyer yet its why arent you a teacher yet
wFqQm1541aA,my mom was a teacher she thought the system was so bad that she homeschooled me and my sibling from kindergarten through high school
wFqQm1541aA,my dad used to always say to me growing up you shouldnt want to be a teacher youre too smart for that apparently teaching would be settling for an
wFqQm1541aA,one time almost our entire  math department quit we had no math teachers for a good few days
wFqQm1541aA,i was an exchange student in america for a year from finland now at home im very average student but in america i was easily the smartest in the class
wFqQm1541aA,as a retired teacher with lots of teacher friends i have a few thoughts on this vox was right about some
wFqQm1541aA,lets also talk about the fact that teaching in the us may mean putting yourself between a gun and your students
wFqQm1541aA,as someone who taught secondary math in the us for two years and then left teaching for good i can tell you what the problem is
wFqQm1541aA,how to keep teachers and improve education in two steps
wFqQm1541aA,the quality of education is vastly different from state to state
wFqQm1541aA,in italy basically everyone wants to be a teacher because its one of the last stable jobs as privatesector jobs are highly unsafe
wFqQm1541aA,in my country there is a norm of having to greet your teacher everytime you pass them to give teachers the insentives that they are highly respected
wFqQm1541aA,idk where they got their numbers but teachers in korea do not work just 6 hours 48 minutes school starts at
wFqQm1541aA,my math teacher quit because the kids in my school were bullying him i feel really bad about it and hope hes ok
wFqQm1541aA,i would encourage people like anna to get the local schools international programs in asia countries they will be surprised to know how much power they can hold
wFqQm1541aA,this isnt a joke
wFqQm1541aA,i was a teacher and im leaving education after this year its so sad because i love teaching and my students but i just couldnt make it work anymore
wFqQm1541aA, we might want to take a few pages from finlands book
wFqQm1541aA,welcome to teaching where the salaries are low and everything is your fault
wFqQm1541aA,in the us majority of the population believe teachers are babysitters for their kids than an actual profession
wFqQm1541aA,spend a lot of schoolbudget in security
wFqQm1541aA,i honestly dont know how they didnt mention the kind of education system finland has
wFqQm1541aA,the worst teachers stay while the fun teachers only stay a year or two
wFqQm1541aA,im a student in oklahoma and i remember a couple a years ago we had the teacher walkout where teachers marched to the ok capital demanding a better pay
wFqQm1541aA,can we take a moment to appreciate the overall graphics that they used with this video its great
wFqQm1541aA,us vs the rest of the world
wFqQm1541aA,ive heard my teachers joke about their salaries with the students sometimes its cool that they can joke with us but also sad that they get paid so little
wFqQm1541aA,if anyone says something that compares the us to the rest of the world they really just mean western europe
wFqQm1541aA,big point this video doesnt mention is that american teachers have to furnish their own classrooms out of pocket
wFqQm1541aA,my mom was a teacher in america and she quit because she couldnt take how disrespectful the kids were and how long she had to work
wFqQm1541aA,as a substitute teacher in australia i can afford to own a property and can take unpaid leave and travel overseas for a month every year
wFqQm1541aA,my math teacher actually decided to quit because our superintendent said they need freshminded younger teachers instead of old and tired teachers
wFqQm1541aA,teachers or the backbone of literally everything your doctors your engineers your lawyers etc you wouldnt have them without teachers
wFqQm1541aA,needing security guards at schools in developed countries is just so freaking messed up
wFqQm1541aA,stop focusing on scores tests and all that school is so much more than that in ways that cant be measured
wFqQm1541aA,america spends more on securitythan other countries
wFqQm1541aA,in poland begginer teachers earn less than someone who works on cash register who often wasnt at the university
wFqQm1541aA,i live in finland and honestly my homeroom teacher is so chill
wFqQm1541aA,once my physics teacher said being a teacher isnt a job its a lifestyle
wFqQm1541aA,treat schools as education not as business
wFqQm1541aA,i love the visual presentation of this video congrats on whoever made it
wFqQm1541aA,can we appreciate the fact that the whole video was made by rearranging physical stuff not animation this takes time
wFqQm1541aA,i think this video forget to mention some important points 
wFqQm1541aA,instead of having a teacher appreciation day how about we just actually help them out and pay them more
wFqQm1541aA,honestly there are way more factors going on here
wFqQm1541aA,you should also talk about the good quality of finlands education compared to other countries
wFqQm1541aA,my cousins father who works with technology for chevron and has for many years finished paying off his college depot at age 42 he is 46 as of this year
wFqQm1541aA,also talk about how schools are so quick to throw money at the sports departments while everybody else has to scratch and use their own money

pp-zw4ykOpw,the touchinterface on that air fryer looks horrendous i cant fathom how anyone would be able to use it without having the usermanual on hand
pp-zw4ykOpw,id love to see a video where you test this specific air fryer against a deep fryer and an oven

pp-zw4ykOpw,frozen meatballs in the air fryer are amazing they get the maiyard reaction on the outside of the entire ball and since theyre frozen the inside stays juicy
pp-zw4ykOpw,i have a drawer in my freezer for snacks that go in the air fryer super quick and super easy

pp-zw4ykOpw,having a typical hong kong kitchen my air fryer is such a good alternative to a conventional oven
pp-zw4ykOpw,well you guys just cost me 250 cdn thanks a bunch seriously though  i was on the fence about these things and this practical test pushed me over the edge

pp-zw4ykOpw,i love my airfryer but i have the ninja one with the grill i also love that its always timed so you cannot forget about it and endanger the kitchen
pp-zw4ykOpw,i have the original 1 drawer version of this and love it but your making me want the two drawer version even though i usually just cook for myself
pp-zw4ykOpw,honestly my air fryer gets used primarily for chips and sausages mostly its just so quick and simple especially when you are cooking for children

pp-zw4ykOpw,please more air fryer recipes i love mine and i need inspiration
8N5wssPlSdE,when linus gets in his problem solving zone its pretty impressive to observe he wraps it in humor but the dude has frickin skills
8N5wssPlSdE,it hilarious how david is all happy and working well and linus is having a terrible time and nothing is working
8N5wssPlSdE,i swear that instead of ceo linus should rename his position to company dad
8N5wssPlSdE,david was so confident in his jank ass previous setup its actually kind of inspiring
8N5wssPlSdE,1 even though its for content i love how linus seems like a genuine friend to his employees and they have fun and joke together
8N5wssPlSdE,it wouldnt be a good video if it wasnt a challenge
8N5wssPlSdE,so this is the man who has that amazing laugh that i always hear behind the camera
8N5wssPlSdE,its a good starter mic to see if i like streaming he says as he has a 2000 webcam
8N5wssPlSdE,i like watching these 5000 upgrades like man i could totally afford that wood panel
8N5wssPlSdE,i cant wait for the day when somebody makes an all amd rig using intels money
8N5wssPlSdE,i love how hes casually standing outside his own house through the window with thousands of dollars of boxes in front of him
8N5wssPlSdE,i like how each tech upgrade has descended further into chaos
8N5wssPlSdE,this is definitely my favourite series man just seeing linus disappointed and judging his people  amazing
8N5wssPlSdE,linus ok lets make sure we get the peel on the back of this one i accidentally left andys on and it turns out that its actually needed for cooling
8N5wssPlSdE,the editing is on  point love the  counterpoint during the radiator x desk assembly
8N5wssPlSdE,the best thing about davids setup is those big apartment windows letting in all that lovely natural light its so nice
8N5wssPlSdE,i love how everyone is so excited like christmas morning while linus is like the wholesome dad
8N5wssPlSdE,i love how contrasting experience david and linus are having tthroughout this video
8N5wssPlSdE,i rarely say thanks to giant corporations but intel sponsoring these and making these happen is fantastic this series is awesome
8N5wssPlSdE,cant believe you hide this man behind the camera
8N5wssPlSdE,david seems like the kind of person that starts asking for a cup of sugar for a cake and ends up borrowing your oven for his muffin factory
8N5wssPlSdE,oh its sad you cant plug the dongle into this
8N5wssPlSdE,i have watched this 100 timesssand i love it this is the best tech upgrade ever
8N5wssPlSdE,he was genuinely hyped made it so much better
8N5wssPlSdE,i aspire to be as confident in david in life with that janky setup of his

8N5wssPlSdE,david is actually the best dude ever hes so kind and fun
8N5wssPlSdE,the more i watch this video the better im gonna deal when i build my first pc
8N5wssPlSdE,i thoroughly enjoyed jamess video and all of the others but i had to stop at 73x to just say this is my favorite hands down
8N5wssPlSdE,david is the embodiment of making the best out of any situation
8N5wssPlSdE,i feel so bad for him having to live with an rtx 3080 and not install it until they start filming that must be super painful
8N5wssPlSdE,i love to see that this video is sponsored by intel and also i love the fact that david is using an amd ryzen cpu on his gaming machine amd
8N5wssPlSdE,this was by far my favorite episode of this so far also david is not the only person to stream with an ursa 
8N5wssPlSdE,please more of these theyre too entertaining
8N5wssPlSdE,note on the avermedia card being in the same iommu group as the ethernet card you can just use an acs override patch on it
8N5wssPlSdE,david is still one of my favorites at ltt
8N5wssPlSdE,almost every time i see a pc built on this channel im reminded pc components desperately need to be standardized to a much stricter degree
8N5wssPlSdE,i didnt laught that hard in your videos for a long time awesome one lovin it wanna see david more fequently funny and cool guy
8N5wssPlSdE,this intro gets me every time  yes ive seen this 5 times already  the chaotic nonchalance of david speaks to me
8N5wssPlSdE,its refreshing to see so many lmg staff still rocking a 1080ti this recentlymakes my evga hybrid 1080ti ftw3 not feel so
8N5wssPlSdE,you never know when youre gonna have to burn a ps3 game
8N5wssPlSdE,this is still one of my favorite tech upgrades
8N5wssPlSdE,intel cant hold on anymore
8N5wssPlSdE,ahhh even though i love these videos it makes me a bit sad that i dont even have a 1000 dollar budget let alone 5000
8N5wssPlSdE,dude you can tell linus and david have been friends for ages
8N5wssPlSdE,its great to finally have davids goofy laugh on screen
8N5wssPlSdE,davids laugh is highly contagious it makes me laugh when i hear it almost like a winnie the pooh esk laugh lol
8N5wssPlSdE,when after 7 months of these videos you realise anthony and rileys extreme tech upgrades were simple af
8N5wssPlSdE,i really like these series its so real
8N5wssPlSdE,this video just made me feel so good about myself
8N5wssPlSdE,this video and anthony upgrade army two favorite they are both so informative while being entertaining
8N5wssPlSdE,david is so positive i love it
8N5wssPlSdE,linus is the best boss ever lol would def not mind working for this man xd
8N5wssPlSdE,i love this series its so good haha
8N5wssPlSdE,i love how most of the really big tech youtubers for example mrwhosetheboss linus mkbhd have the option to make video quality 2160p
8N5wssPlSdE,cooler master makes such good cases and linus and david make them look like the worst filtered cases ever with all the sticky dust and hair inside
8N5wssPlSdE,carefully all kinds of wrong is my new favourite sentence
8N5wssPlSdE,its not even close to budget i love him
8N5wssPlSdE,its a bunch of harry potter books
8N5wssPlSdE,youre watercooling your nas wait im watercooling your nas
8N5wssPlSdE,soon the 5k challenge will be
8N5wssPlSdE,linus points out something jank
8N5wssPlSdE,this dude has some of the coolest walls in his house the accent walls are all some crazy pattern
8N5wssPlSdE,thank you so much for pointing out the peel on the back of the cx i missed it too and just had a full blown panic moment
8N5wssPlSdE,the editor that threw in the sweet acoustic guitar music over the home improvement bits is genius i died laughing
8N5wssPlSdE,would love to see a david update with it all finished
8N5wssPlSdE,im probably the only person in the world using an ursa to stream                      gavin from slomoguys using a phantom flex 4k as a webcam

N4wBrYyu8U8,so do you prefer the design of the larger range rover or this new range rover sport
N4wBrYyu8U8,i love how they kept the names rather simple d for diesel e for elektrisch and p for petrol  easy and clever
N4wBrYyu8U8,its hard to imagine future versions of this and the nonsport model they already look so futuristic love it
N4wBrYyu8U8,finally ive been waiting for this since the reveal yesterday
N4wBrYyu8U8,i must say land rover has outdone themselves lets just hope its reliable
N4wBrYyu8U8,we all just appreciate the content this man and his crew makes its just a masterpiece imagine whats hes gonna doing the future
N4wBrYyu8U8,what a gorgeous suv its perfect i have no idea how theyre going to outdo this one in their future models theyve created their own trap
N4wBrYyu8U8,i love range rover my family has a sport supercharged 2014 though so its crazy to see how theyve changed over the years
N4wBrYyu8U8,mat never fails to amaze excite and entertain us
N4wBrYyu8U8,looks great hope they made improvement on reliability department too
N4wBrYyu8U8,looks amazing cant wait to see it tested by mat
N4wBrYyu8U8,the only company whos design is never stoping to evolve
N4wBrYyu8U8,mat never disappoint looking forward for a thorough review from carwow
N4wBrYyu8U8,looks great and tbh i like both the sport and normal range rovers design and looksboth are killer
N4wBrYyu8U8,love the design but would probably go for the full fat version with a v8 in an ideal world
N4wBrYyu8U8,if the p530 is as fast as the old v8 svr i can imagine the next svr will be a down right maniac
N4wBrYyu8U8,personally i prefer the look of the older model
N4wBrYyu8U8,i like that you mentioned off roading capabilities because most of these cars will never even see the dirt and only do school runs lol
N4wBrYyu8U8,love this new rr sport cant wait for matt to get his hands on this vehicle and give it a tickle or two
N4wBrYyu8U8,however i love previous rangerover sport exterior look
N4wBrYyu8U8,love the sport its been my family car for long time this one is lovely cant wait for svr
N4wBrYyu8U8,love all range rover cars especially sport versions by the way great presentation by mat on the new rangie
N4wBrYyu8U8,honestly i love this
N4wBrYyu8U8,you guys working so hard releasing these videos hours apart thank you we appreciate it so much
N4wBrYyu8U8,both the old and new models look cool i feel proud that land rover is owned by an indian brand ie tata
N4wBrYyu8U8,i personally still love brutal design of old generations range rover sport but new design is indeed futuristic and minimalism
N4wBrYyu8U8,congratulations for 7 million now 3 needed to reach 10 million you have made cars more interesting and entertaining which makes interest for those who feel bored from car videos
N4wBrYyu8U8,love the evolving design and look definitely a big baller suv
N4wBrYyu8U8,both new range rovers looks fantastic in and out
N4wBrYyu8U8,looks amazing  which id expect from land rover
N4wBrYyu8U8,really hope carwow review some of the jlr cars soon love the look of the new f pace
N4wBrYyu8U8,definitely a good looking suv if not the best looking out right now
N4wBrYyu8U8,please make them different enough so my neighbours know i got the latest one
N4wBrYyu8U8,hope there is the same v8 sound as the last gen svr
N4wBrYyu8U8,as a sport driver i will always vote sport but last week we saw the brand new full fat version and it looked mega
N4wBrYyu8U8,im definitely anything but an suv guy but this thing looks amazing
N4wBrYyu8U8,what a dream car
N4wBrYyu8U8,its weird how range rover now looks extremelly a lot like the saab 95 from 2010s have they found themselves working rr design team
N4wBrYyu8U8,the interior is amazing the exterior i prefer the old one
N4wBrYyu8U8,i was never a fan of the old one out of my price range being honest but this looks very cool
N4wBrYyu8U8,this looks like it took more of luxurious side than sporty i would take the previous gen any day
N4wBrYyu8U8,good that jlr has got some new awesome products at start  best looking rr for me so far the first one that lets me look beside the jags
N4wBrYyu8U8,its wonderful
N4wBrYyu8U8,old rr sport was much better than this in exterior 
N4wBrYyu8U8,simply amazing the new range rover
N4wBrYyu8U8,the older looks better love the bmw engine upgrade though
N4wBrYyu8U8,kind of looks like a discovery more than a sport
N4wBrYyu8U8,finally vedio is here waiting for matt to review
N4wBrYyu8U8,i hope the svr version isnt a turbocharged turd box that sounds like a blender
N4wBrYyu8U8,for some reason i wanna see matt review the new hummer
N4wBrYyu8U8,rear of this new rr sport is just fantastically done
N4wBrYyu8U8,wow bmw 44 twin turbo v8 in the range rover thats very interesting i wonder if the discovery and defender will come with this option in the future too
N4wBrYyu8U8,i love the black line between the lights it reminds me the models of peugeot like the 3008 from 2017 and the new 308
N4wBrYyu8U8,having owned a newer one i loved driving it and they are the boss suv
N4wBrYyu8U8,this is another level for range rover
N4wBrYyu8U8,the new range rover sport is better than gle q7 and others by a mile well done land rover
N4wBrYyu8U8,it looks great to me especially in that colour
N4wBrYyu8U8,wooow this interior so beautifulfuture is amazing love it
N4wBrYyu8U8,lets hope it doesnt breakdown as much as the older oneslooks nice tho
N4wBrYyu8U8,will it spend 50 of its time in the mechanic like older generations
N4wBrYyu8U8,i much prefer the senior sport especially my 2010
N4wBrYyu8U8,wow im crazy in love with this range rover sport
N4wBrYyu8U8,i respect everyone who were involved in this seriously the best piece that i ve ever seen on youtube  hate off to well all  love your videos
N4wBrYyu8U8,i thought it would look a lot better when i saw the wrapped prototypes being test driven
N4wBrYyu8U8,i love the unique design and the performance of range rover suvs
N4wBrYyu8U8,id like to know how it stays immaculate off road
N4wBrYyu8U8,i was waiting for this review
N4wBrYyu8U8,i prefer the previous car to this one 
N4wBrYyu8U8,matt congrats on 7 million subscribers keep up the good work
N4wBrYyu8U8,beautiful i prefer this to the full size ranger rover
N4wBrYyu8U8,i love the v8 engine of this new range rover sport
N4wBrYyu8U8,just realised it congrats to 7 million you wow us everyday
N4wBrYyu8U8,i hope the new svr is good
N4wBrYyu8U8,mat thank you so much for this insane video
N4wBrYyu8U8,i cant wait for the svr version
N4wBrYyu8U8,are the new landrovers more reliable than the old onesfor such a long time they have scored very low on reliabilitythey are known to breakdown easily
N4wBrYyu8U8,as a non range rover expert i have to say this looks exactly like the old model
N4wBrYyu8U8,mat you and yianni are my favourite car reviewers and drag racers ever
N4wBrYyu8U8,i prefer the look of the old sport hopefully the svr looks more aggressive
N4wBrYyu8U8,i love the full size range more
N4wBrYyu8U8,looks amazing
N4wBrYyu8U8,i like design of old one i think it cant just give sport vibe
N4wBrYyu8U8,its going to sell like mad
N4wBrYyu8U8,as always excellent video or presentation maybe everything
PHOqj8L1t50,god have mercy on ukrainian people
PHOqj8L1t50,very encouraging to hear that german promises are being fulfilled  with weaponry to resist i think ukrainians have the will  russia is soon going to find it hard to breathe
PHOqj8L1t50,sucks to be on either side
PHOqj8L1t50,why are you calling it a peoples republic
PHOqj8L1t50,separated from life well done
PHOqj8L1t50,after a while of hearing about ukrainian casualties its nice to hear it the other way
PHOqj8L1t50,my heart is bleeding for them
PHOqj8L1t50,uk ministry of defence has proved sooo accurate so far
PHOqj8L1t50,its not just the howitzers its the ammo supply and targeting technology that modern artillery need for the battlefield
PHOqj8L1t50,only getting weapon for fight is not enoughfighter should have heart to fight in battlefield
PHOqj8L1t50,such great news
PHOqj8L1t50,we have more men than they have bullets
PHOqj8L1t50,good job ukraine
PHOqj8L1t50,i feel very sad for all the families losing their loved ones in this war
PHOqj8L1t50,excellent news slava ukraini heroyam slava
PHOqj8L1t50,one thing i believe we can all agree on is that the ukrainian people are tough way tougher than russia expected
PHOqj8L1t50,so sad that we keep watching peoples lives los
PHOqj8L1t50,45 left to go victory for ukraine
PHOqj8L1t50,slava ukraini 
PHOqj8L1t50,yah sure sure moscow is nearly surrounded
PHOqj8L1t50,god almighty help the people of ukraine to keep the fight up and eventually take it to the doorstep of these aggressive and brutal russian force
PHOqj8L1t50,ive been documenting the war since 2014 lots of material from the front
PHOqj8L1t50,russia seems to have taken a leaf from the vietnamese in their tactic of sending the local forces in to get chopped up saves all that pesky disagreement afterwards
PHOqj8L1t50,will be super interesting we get to see a  artillery battle with quality vs quantity
PHOqj8L1t50,first 128 days of war
PHOqj8L1t50,this is excellent progress keep degrading their forces
PHOqj8L1t50,both sides have high casualities both suffer
PHOqj8L1t50,very good news indeed
PHOqj8L1t50,what a good newsif europe could help ukraine a lot more and faster may be the war would be ending soon
PHOqj8L1t50,slava ukraini
PHOqj8L1t50,news enunciated very perfectly with just the correct mix of punching and shoulder thrusting do you suppose joe inwood was once a rugby man
PHOqj8L1t50,this is how russia can lose so many they are forcing military age men in these regions to join
PHOqj8L1t50,always talking about russias losses and low moral but i never heard a single statement about the ukrainians side
PHOqj8L1t50,love how media put exclamation marks on top of most important  part they are lying about
PHOqj8L1t50,russian seperatus should have separated and moved 20 miles to russia when they had the chance
PHOqj8L1t50,always a good day when you get news worth reading
PHOqj8L1t50,never leave a job half done 
PHOqj8L1t50,look when can it end
PHOqj8L1t50,lets hope the tide turns bless you brave people
PHOqj8L1t50,i dont think we have a very good picture of the overall situation in donetskluhansk
PHOqj8L1t50,naklon industriji oruzjaopet ste pobjedili
PHOqj8L1t50,this is absolutely insane
PHOqj8L1t50,its been hell of a war 
PHOqj8L1t50,victory and peace
PHOqj8L1t50,civil war casualties are often the heaviest in that nations history
PHOqj8L1t50,really good news
PHOqj8L1t50,thats great news 
PHOqj8L1t50,full and brief shared history of ukriane and russia
PHOqj8L1t50,the address change on the us embassy is really going to hit america hardwow  how will they recover from a blow like that
PHOqj8L1t50,i just wonder how their figures are so precise surely one would need to round it off to nearest hundred
PHOqj8L1t50,this madness has to end
PHOqj8L1t50,great  hopefully the other half will join them asap
PHOqj8L1t50,good luck to the ukrainians
PHOqj8L1t50,the thing i find most amusing is that these seperatists and their families will miss being part of ukraine once the war is over
PHOqj8L1t50,how will 7 howitzers tip the scale its only 2 incomplete batteries yes they are among 3 best self propelled howitzers but its not nearly enough to do much
PHOqj8L1t50,slava ukraini
PHOqj8L1t50,i think they changed the address of the us embassy in memory of the thousands of deaths suffered by pro russian forces in donetsk
PHOqj8L1t50,always winning in western media
PHOqj8L1t50,russian force cannot make any progress in june cause there are no resources
PHOqj8L1t50,slava ukraine
PHOqj8L1t50,ok separatists have lost half of their number and are running westwards  comic news
PHOqj8L1t50,still looks like a lot a ground has been gained by the russians i hope the ukrainian soldiers dont get sorrounded trying to push too far forward
PHOqj8L1t50,slava ukraini
PHOqj8L1t50,what do you expect their hearts were never in the fight they will go down in history as the vichy french of ukraine
PHOqj8L1t50,horrific loses on both sides thanks to the egomaniac little boy putin
PHOqj8L1t50,thanks germany we gotta get em
PHOqj8L1t50,when their being used as cannon fodder high casualty rates should be expected
PHOqj8L1t50,good i want to see that number at 100 by the end of the year
PHOqj8L1t50,ok germany a little late but finally coming through for ukraine
PHOqj8L1t50,dprs forces were 30000 and since 2014 have been receiving heavy artillery and missle systems for years now

XIROoDszUzU,the women and clothing are lovely but the music is horrible
DduGAca6hZU,i think that huggy wuggy having maximum obedience implies that he wouldnt have tried to kill you on his own accord and that someone sent him after you
DduGAca6hZU,personally i feel that the protagonist is themselves an experiment  something about the way poppy says youll do whatever she asks makes me think of that maximum obedience line
DduGAca6hZU,like everytime matpat is here to create the lore of a game
DduGAca6hZU,this man should be in a movie and call it theory where this man theories comes to life and he has to find a way for everything to be normal
DduGAca6hZU,really love mommy long legs voice acting and just her character in general
DduGAca6hZU,the note that poppy sent wasnt sent by her though how could she send it behind the case
DduGAca6hZU,now this is dark even by my standards this lore is definitely getting better
DduGAca6hZU,matpat the poppy playtime lore could even be as more complicating as fnaf but it looks like it wont be too complicating
DduGAca6hZU,my nephew had a huggy wuggy party hes 6 the party stuff was bizzare and i cannot understand why kids are so into characters from a jumpscare horror game
DduGAca6hZU,as someone who is terrified of dolls the plain doll jumpscares that this channel shows absolutely scares me to my core
DduGAca6hZU,this man is so obsessed with fnaf that he relates it to something thats not at all fnaf and i love it
DduGAca6hZU,even though the company that made poppy playtime is very shitty i cant deny the lore of the game is very interesting and intriguing
DduGAca6hZU,poppys betrayal reminds me heavily of alice angels betrayal from chapter 3
DduGAca6hZU,can we just appreciate how much effort he puts into all of this
DduGAca6hZU,i love to think that you just write the lore whenever the creators mob just watch your videos and go hm hes right do that
DduGAca6hZU,i love how matpat is just roasting the game while also theorizing it
DduGAca6hZU,if you listen to the tape on ludwigs office at the end there is this sound and when poppy is interrupted you can hear the same sound from the tape
DduGAca6hZU,fnaf referrence
DduGAca6hZU,when i heard huggy wuggy had maximum obedience i thought the same thing its nice to know that someone else theorized this as well
DduGAca6hZU,i love the commitment energy and uniqueness of intro matt makes
DduGAca6hZU,lets all be honest weve all been waiting for this game theory ever since this chapter came out
DduGAca6hZU,i just love how much matt uses the fnaf stuff its honestly highlarious
DduGAca6hZU,please do calamity mod lore i think you will have a lot of fun talking about and it would be awesome to see
DduGAca6hZU,i havent watched you in forever im glad to have come across one of your videos again much love 3
DduGAca6hZU,matpat on fnaf and that is the final story of fnaf
DduGAca6hZU,i have a little theory about huggy wuggy
DduGAca6hZU,my question is how does poppy a doll made in 1950 have a soul of someone who died in the 1960s
DduGAca6hZU,i love these lore videos on horror games
DduGAca6hZU,poppy playtime really watched your video about changing games because of theorists and did exactly not that  they explained the huggy  1006 connection really well  great story
DduGAca6hZU,decent analysis video thanks for uploading
DduGAca6hZU,matpat always finds away to compare things to fnaf lol
DduGAca6hZU,the way mommy long legs said theyll made me part of him gave me the chills
DduGAca6hZU,mommy long legs death is so brutal its amazing this chapter did better than the first one for sure
DduGAca6hZU,mommy long legs recognized the player character as a staff member and said you deserved to die for your role
DduGAca6hZU,poppy saying we are perfect and keeps us trapped in the factory
DduGAca6hZU,from what i heard from another youtuber theres some cut audio from poppy during the train sequence in which she reveals that she needs the protags help not betraying him
DduGAca6hZU,i love watching theory videos for games ill never play its weird but these games are super interesting
DduGAca6hZU,the fact that everything is similar to fnaf makes it so hard to make a horror game
DduGAca6hZU,the claw reminded me of the other mothers hand from coraline
DduGAca6hZU,yess ive been waiting for a poppy playtime chapter 2 theory
DduGAca6hZU,the fnaf similarities are golden and this just shows how sarcastically excited mat is for a new update on their lore
DduGAca6hZU,wy do i love these poppy playtime episodes so much the intros the awesome lore how bout all the above
DduGAca6hZU,im surprised that he didnt talk about the alarm going off at the end of chapter two when poppy gets interrupted im sure hell talk about it in part 2
DduGAca6hZU,this game is giving lots of bendy and the ink machine vibes
DduGAca6hZU,is it just me or is poppys evil speech in the cut version really fun to cat out
DduGAca6hZU,so far this game seems like it would make for a great multiplayer survival game where you play as one of the toys
DduGAca6hZU,matpats intros just keep on getting better and better dont they
DduGAca6hZU,very nice theory i love the fnaf references
DduGAca6hZU,love the new matpat pictures animation lol its just also funny that you can show your emotions easily
DduGAca6hZU,cool lore great vid as usual and thanks for the shoutout at
DduGAca6hZU,i love how often matpat randomly references fnaf throughout the video its like he cant escape it
DduGAca6hZU,also did you know that mommy committed a severe skill issue moment that without it the player can literally just die
DduGAca6hZU,matpat is finally starting to become mildly disillusioned with his job now he can actually become funny what a joyous day
DduGAca6hZU,mat telling fnaf to settle down is my favorite

hSDhBXSdYig,looking back at y2k fashion leaves me relieved that i was a grunge lover in my teens it saved me from some intense fashion moments
hSDhBXSdYig,the fact 70 of these trends are things ive been wearing for the last couple years make me feel like a trend setter
hSDhBXSdYig,is it just me who believes so many of these are actually not trends right now like jean skirts futuristic jelly sneaker kilts clogs etc are like very unpopular imo
hSDhBXSdYig,i love the baggy cargo effortlessly look

hSDhBXSdYig,cargo pants were so popular in the early 2000s glad its back

hSDhBXSdYig,im all about the 90s and y2k fashion
hSDhBXSdYig,long denim skirts can be super unflattering but id say their easiest to pull off if youre super skinny otherwise its a frumpy look
hSDhBXSdYig,liked for the duggar shade
hSDhBXSdYig,i feel like if people actually do like those big prints they probably dont regret spending money on them
hSDhBXSdYig,futuristic jelly sneakers we wear those hiking in norway lmao
hSDhBXSdYig,i think y2k looks awful it never looked good back then and it still looks bad now
hSDhBXSdYig,you would rock cargos

hSDhBXSdYig,hey girl where do u get ur tees from

hSDhBXSdYig,hii very late comment but where is your jacket from 
hSDhBXSdYig,good luck
uNt_ReLwk40,this shows how much effort steam put into the steamos for steamdeck to not be a dissapointment
uNt_ReLwk40,you dont press b to go back in retroarch you are already on the root menu
uNt_ReLwk40,everyone  desperate to get their hands on a steamdeck
uNt_ReLwk40,oh no windows having problems with patchy hard to find drivers which need to be community fixed
uNt_ReLwk40,windows 1011 consumes a lot of system resources when compared to linux every developer has probably noticed that when compiling on windows 1011 in comparison to linux
uNt_ReLwk40,the aya neo does share many of the same issues here
uNt_ReLwk40,a few things i want to note that may help you guys in future videos
uNt_ReLwk40,in steamos desktop mode when you exit steam you get the same other input scheme as on windows when you exit steam there
uNt_ReLwk40,you need to add retroarch as a non steam game to the steam client and then the deck controls will work properly  same behaviour with the steam controller
uNt_ReLwk40,if you take the time to install windows on your system youre more likely going to tweak settings that improve performance or alleviate annoyances such as disabling uac
uNt_ReLwk40,windows is just a fallback solution for things that dont work well on linux yet why would anyone try to install it on a system that works perfectly with linux
uNt_ReLwk40,you can use the steam deck interface on windows online there is a tutorial to do this
uNt_ReLwk40,absolutely love the hardware controllermouse switch on my gpd win 1 it might not be customizable but it just works
uNt_ReLwk40,wtf i was not expecting the gog client i made in my free time while learning python to reach a linux tech tips video at some point
uNt_ReLwk40,seeing someone install windows an a device and have flaky behaviour due to badnonexistent drivers is such a role reversal wild
uNt_ReLwk40,on the verification process they should open it up to community contribution
uNt_ReLwk40,thankfully i have none of these issues control issues with my onexplayer amd 5700u
uNt_ReLwk40,precompiled shaders was a very smart move by valve as the hardware is the same on every sd
uNt_ReLwk40,i just got my steam deck today and i was thinking of installing windows os on it thanks for talking me out of it linus
uNt_ReLwk40,you know youve made it when youre holding your steam deck up with another steam deck
uNt_ReLwk40,as an 8year linux user i fully support your right to put whatever you want on hardware you own thats the linux ethos your computer youre in control
uNt_ReLwk40,i wonder would it be possible to run windows 1011 on a virtual machine inside steamos to play games that only work in windows instead of actually booting into windows
uNt_ReLwk40,i would be interested in a steam deck docked video replacing an old desktop with a steam deck
uNt_ReLwk40,the control scheme is pretty much just windows with steam controller so its pretty decent dont think id recommend it on the deck though
uNt_ReLwk40,i own this and i can do what i want
uNt_ReLwk40,its nice to see a company like valve to take such a different route compared to what the others take huge respect to valve
uNt_ReLwk40,probably silly to ask but how did it perform with windows 11
uNt_ReLwk40,i feel like this is a work in progress in addition to a followup for steamos id love to see a followup on windows
uNt_ReLwk40,steam os is now my default desktop environment i love this
uNt_ReLwk40,i guess emulators will be really awesome on the steam deck
uNt_ReLwk40,now looking at this makes me wonder how good steamos would perform on a regular pc
uNt_ReLwk40,drivers are not optimized for the hardware yet these look to be almost all driver issues
uNt_ReLwk40,linus linus linus thank you for doing you  i dont always agree with you but thats ok
uNt_ReLwk40,definitely interested in dualboot video thanks for the review  i reserved a top tier steam deck
uNt_ReLwk40,i just hope the steam deck pushes devs to add linux support gaming is litterally the only reason i and many if my friends still use windows
uNt_ReLwk40,retroarch windows steam finally together in the field of not having a joypad input properly
uNt_ReLwk40,setting all your apps in task manager to highpriority or realtime will speed them up
uNt_ReLwk40,imagine installing windows on steam deck just to use steam on the windows version installed on the steam deck
uNt_ReLwk40,id love to see another video on this when windows 11 works since it is apparently 20  25 faster
uNt_ReLwk40,now windows users can understand how linux users feel
uNt_ReLwk40,hearing that valve is certifying game compatibility with steamos by just booting up the game and making sure it runs initially is absolutely unacceptable
uNt_ReLwk40,yeah gonna keep this in mind when i buy a steam deck besides it could already run google and stuff right
uNt_ReLwk40,left and right clicks for the mouse can be swapped around in the windows cp  devices  mouse  set your primary button leftright
uNt_ReLwk40,you could simply use the steamdeck as a small lightweight capable low power consuming pc to do some work on for example forget gaming for a second
uNt_ReLwk40,wouldnt the shared memory configurations be similar to how onboard graphics intel used to use like my i53317u and i73667u uses the same ram unified memory p
uNt_ReLwk40,new steam deck users im about to install windows no one can stop me
uNt_ReLwk40,for whatever reason uac disables software controlling your devices
2ywCAiu9hI0,i love miss xos confidence  its important to be your own cheerleader  ensure you dont settle for less
2ywCAiu9hI0,i would scream and diealso thoughi low key feel like she said exactly what you said in a different tone
2ywCAiu9hI0,how are you gonna live and stuff  that really hurt me meaning people who works at shoprite are not living they cant live 
2ywCAiu9hI0,but  nawe youre constantly shaming broke men owamie youve dragged your ex for filth over how broke he is
2ywCAiu9hI0,being comfortable has levels the most comfortable influencers dont have to say a word take lee k for example we see it you dont have to convince us
2ywCAiu9hI0,i love miss xo s confidence but the minute she said im your god  i was like no thats just too much
2ywCAiu9hI0,its sad that we are in a world where money determines your worth
2ywCAiu9hI0,i love miss xo i dont necessarily agree with everything she says but i love love love her
2ywCAiu9hI0,hey ninja miss xo is just using hyperbole with that statement she is just exaggerating and not meaning it literally
2ywCAiu9hI0,i love miss xos confidence a girl love what she loves
2ywCAiu9hI0,lmao when you rolled the video i almost dropped dead   she was just so disgusted  i fully agree with you eish miss xo
2ywCAiu9hI0,yes its a reality for a lot of people in sa but its not necessarily her reality
2ywCAiu9hI0,i wish we can be proud of success without undermining other people
2ywCAiu9hI0,you starting to sound like the girl you suing whats her name vault what what maybe if u watched xoli yo would understand her lingo
2ywCAiu9hI0,exactly if you dont like something you dont keep telling it that you dont like it you simply choose the one you like and keep it moving
2ywCAiu9hI0,the world we are living in nowadays is so sad one cant find love because they are broke 
2ywCAiu9hI0,one thing about you and missxo
2ywCAiu9hI0,she is basically saying she will not date a broke man too she merely said in a dramatic way
2ywCAiu9hI0,the lifestyle she meant not like they cannot breath without money lol it is being taken out of context in that clip
2ywCAiu9hI0,you said the same thing just different words  scream and die is just an expression
2ywCAiu9hI0,theres no better way of saying it  she said what you always say
2ywCAiu9hI0,owamie the picture you choose thou  am droping dead and dying
2ywCAiu9hI0,she is not out of teach with reality she is crazy but whatever she is on is messing her up one day she will wake but to a different realization
2ywCAiu9hI0,i am xo xo is me in this aspect you are always bashing broke men and yet you want to bash xo for sinning same way you do
2ywCAiu9hI0,miss xo always complaining about heartbreak back in the ranches rich men will forever rock her on top of that shes a baby mamashe thinks those men take her serious
2ywCAiu9hI0,ene we are busy living xemwith our little salaries we wake up every morning and pushing life
2ywCAiu9hI0,there are people who work at shoprite who take care of their familiesbut im not going to judge her coz its her opinion
2ywCAiu9hI0,i will also scream and de  as much as they always say they wont date an ugly woman nathi we will scream and die than date broke ninjas
2ywCAiu9hI0,yet she doesnt scream and die for always being a side dish for rich married men that would make me scream and die
2ywCAiu9hI0,i dont think she was shaming
2ywCAiu9hI0,its important to stay away from such people  its such comments that get people to give their souls to the devil
2ywCAiu9hI0,this girl is hilariousif she had so much moneywhy be a mattress to married men
2ywCAiu9hI0,one thing miss xo akasabi mntu
2ywCAiu9hI0,leave her she will live to receive her karma  hope to be alive to see it god dont  like lokhumbi
2ywCAiu9hI0,she said the same thing about bad sex
2ywCAiu9hI0,but in a nut shell she meant the same thing you always say about dating broke guys
2ywCAiu9hI0,youre really obsessed with xoli shame
2ywCAiu9hI0,people are out of touch with reality but you yourself wouldnt date a man who works from shoprite and earns less than you
2ywCAiu9hI0,95of rich man have partners its gonna be hard for someone to find a single rich guy
2ywCAiu9hI0,in her defence she did say shes not teaching womengirls on how to attract men
2ywCAiu9hI0,mara she dd say i just people are not used to people telling their truth
2ywCAiu9hI0,owamie allow me to laugh
2ywCAiu9hI0,love her six figures means hundred thousands not million thats how slang is you say six figures
2ywCAiu9hI0,the question is can you date some1 whos working at shoprite   if your answer is no then what is the diferent between you and that lady
2ywCAiu9hI0,she did not come for anyone thats her preference though
2ywCAiu9hI0,guys leave miss x0 alone she is rich
2ywCAiu9hI0,is this the kettle calling the pot black
2ywCAiu9hI0,queen ninja is back
2ywCAiu9hI0,owamie is 31 years old
2ywCAiu9hI0,i agree with you owami she is out of touch of reality naive based on her response and yet to learn about life
2ywCAiu9hI0,leave mrs xo alone thats life  broke man  its a big no
2ywCAiu9hI0,some of those shoprite workers are her subscribers she is where shes today bcs of them
2ywCAiu9hI0,i will scream n die if old disgusting men approach me
2ywCAiu9hI0,she wasnt shaming though
2ywCAiu9hI0,we are here
2ywCAiu9hI0,look whos obsessed with miss xo lol i know you dont like her but do you really have to
2ywCAiu9hI0,lol xoli ke problem
2ywCAiu9hI0,high value nonsense
2ywCAiu9hI0,first one to commenti love xoli too sewendzeni nkosiyam udarly
2ywCAiu9hI0,yeah the problem was the way she put it otherwise kaloku ugirl dates rich men only so shop rite workers are infants to her
2ywCAiu9hI0,uhm i dont think what she said is wrong i think everyones just pressed about how she said it it was a little extra nd all that was not necessary
2ywCAiu9hI0,however which way she said it sadly at the end of the day its her preference like yours she just said it in a diffrent way
2ywCAiu9hI0,thats  a meme right there i will scream and die

ug6vChkIUGI,im pretty sure the umpire was going for the other team
ug6vChkIUGI,the blue jays were a really good team team rally fries
ug6vChkIUGI,i appreciate the consistency of the videos go team rally fries
ug6vChkIUGI,i love how benny doesnt take it too seriously and just loves to see the kids have fun
ug6vChkIUGI,it was an amazing game i think after the blue jays scored those runs in the 1st inning set the tone for the rally fries
ug6vChkIUGI,aaliyah is amazing love watching this team play
ug6vChkIUGI,i want lumpy to be successful he steps out and they threw it outside he has no chance of hitting it just want lumpy to hit
ug6vChkIUGI,i just love the good sportsmanship that benny has and i hope they win the world series
ug6vChkIUGI,you have no idea how excited to see these uploads brings me back to the days i played little league thank you so much
ug6vChkIUGI,i love this series so much
ug6vChkIUGI,my mans reaction at the end of the game shows how everyone should be in sports
ug6vChkIUGI,congrats on a great season for a first year team this is awesome ump a little inconsistent in that last game frustrating
ug6vChkIUGI,that was a good run in the world series my team also lost in the semifinals but we all had fun there hope you guys had a good time
ug6vChkIUGI,nice job lumpster keep up the good work
ug6vChkIUGI,last batter needed a softball to hit that

ug6vChkIUGI,great season boys also why did lumpy leave combat
ug6vChkIUGI,im gonna miss team rally fries videos
ug6vChkIUGI,i have a feeling there gonna match up against combat soon
ug6vChkIUGI,hold up ik we cant do nothing now but i think that was a drop 3rd strike at the end
ug6vChkIUGI,just a notice lumpy steps way out when he swings makes it hard for him to hit that outside pitch
ug6vChkIUGI,is it me or do i wanna see team rally fries vs team combat
ug6vChkIUGI,i love your videos rally fries is doing so good
ug6vChkIUGI,we made it to playoffs so hopefully we will see you one game
ug6vChkIUGI,other team played well umpire had a strange strike zone
ug6vChkIUGI,benny lumpy is backing out of the box when he is up im now sure u know that
ug6vChkIUGI,lumpy is just so talented and i want to be in a dodgerfilms video go team rally fries

ug6vChkIUGI,lumpy is a great player i feel like every at bat he hits it to the fence

ug6vChkIUGI,great game umps strike zone was wack
ug6vChkIUGI,lumpy great job keep it up
ug6vChkIUGI,rally fries are a very good team they did so good good game
ug6vChkIUGI,i played the 12u oxnard bluejays before and my team won vc dodgers but it was a nice 9 inning game
ug6vChkIUGI,lets go team rally fries
ug6vChkIUGI,seemed like the umpire wasnt very consistent for both sides some of those pitches were strikes for the other team
ug6vChkIUGI,go rally fries
ug6vChkIUGI,lumpy should work on keeping the ball in front of him
ug6vChkIUGI,great game lumpy
ug6vChkIUGI,love you team rally fries
ug6vChkIUGI,ive noticed that every rally fries hitter steps out of the box when they swing so its shortens up their bat
ug6vChkIUGI,good job rally fries
ug6vChkIUGI,i thought this was a double elimination tournament this was rally fries 1st loss
ug6vChkIUGI,when lumpy was on the angels my cousin jr played against lumpy and his first game and my cousin jr took a picture with you guys
ug6vChkIUGI,whats lumpy favorite position to play
ug6vChkIUGI,bro lumpy thor jayden are the ones tht carry not gonna lie
ug6vChkIUGI,omg i would cry if i had this umpire in my games
ug6vChkIUGI,this ump is crazy only calls strikes right up the middle
ug6vChkIUGI,lets go rally fries
ug6vChkIUGI,dude these eight year olds are better than every team ive ever played on
ug6vChkIUGI,ell lumpy the reason he keeps on swinging and missing is because hes stepping out and hes not able the reach the ball

Bv-56hHYWAg,no please dont take your clothes off boris its embarrassing enough having a bumbling scarecrow for a leader dont make it worse

Bv-56hHYWAg,if it wasnt for couple of them there  the average age around that table would hover around 80 
xy0ZHMvvUnw,you perfectly captured what using the pointer on the menu was like
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the fact that they animated the twitchyness of the cursor was hilarious and at the same time relatable
xy0ZHMvvUnw,this is the most depressing game of bowling ive ever seen
xy0ZHMvvUnw,i just noticed not even a second before he throws the wii remote the cursor jerks up really fast love the detail
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the hand moving on screen gave me a nostalgia l didnt know could exist haha
xy0ZHMvvUnw,never thought id get emotional over a mii character
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the fact that he was able to replicate the excact feel of the pointer astonishes me
xy0ZHMvvUnw,that was the most depressing game of bowling ive ever laid my eyes upon
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the bowling part is a little depressing
xy0ZHMvvUnw,can somebody explain to me why i started crying during the part where the miis life gets ruined
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the cursor is animated so accurately
xy0ZHMvvUnw,didt expect wii sports to be retold with even some lore but here it is
xy0ZHMvvUnw,i remember it all from my childhood very accurate especially bowling
xy0ZHMvvUnw,never thought a mans life could end so bad cause of bowling
xy0ZHMvvUnw,everything was pretty much on point me personally i think golf shouldve added more frustration
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the cursor shaking is so incredibly accurate
xy0ZHMvvUnw,i remember playing the resort edition it was so weird especially when little mes favorite game was to fly the plane across the map and dive into the volcano
xy0ZHMvvUnw,i love how accurate the shaking hand thingy on the menu is
xy0ZHMvvUnw,you perfectly illustrated matt abby golf the menu and bowling when your bored
xy0ZHMvvUnw,that bowling part was quite unexpected and genius
xy0ZHMvvUnw,i like how when he went bowling and when he had bombs strapped around his body and got a strike made him instantly get his life back
xy0ZHMvvUnw,its neat how the shakiness and borderlineuncontrollability of the cursor was accurately represented
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the player tries to end his miserable life
xy0ZHMvvUnw,that cursor shake is so accurate considering the fact the remotes are sorta weak
xy0ZHMvvUnw,everybodys talking about how accurate the cursor is but no ones talking about how accurate baseball and golf is
xy0ZHMvvUnw,peter parker i had to beat an old lady with a stick to get this
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the cursor wigging out is the most honest animation i have ever seen on youtube
xy0ZHMvvUnw,that end was the biggest plot twist ive seen
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the cursor is accurate
xy0ZHMvvUnw,this is very accurate specially the wobbly hand
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the boxing one feels like beating matt after 3 seconds
xy0ZHMvvUnw,lmao i love how matt is constantly doing his crazy ass hand movement
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the craziest part of this video is the fact that his wife got a wiistraining order because of what was clearly an accident
xy0ZHMvvUnw,mattkills tem8
xy0ZHMvvUnw,great animation literally cried when the man got his life taken
xy0ZHMvvUnw,lol the one person who constantly shakes their remote to swing rapidly is soooo true
xy0ZHMvvUnw,finally someone who envisioned the  real life of what happens to a mii after bowling
xy0ZHMvvUnw,this is more accurate than id like to admit especially the shaky controller
xy0ZHMvvUnw,this is so relatable since i played this game with my mom all the time when i was little
xy0ZHMvvUnw,as a wii remote i can confirm this is 100 accurate judging from my experience
xy0ZHMvvUnw,as much as i love wii sports the pointer thing couldnt have been more accurate
xy0ZHMvvUnw,him having the worst live
xy0ZHMvvUnw,as a curiosity the other wii characters that appear do not have legs they floated in the air only the player had legs
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the fact that he used the original sound effects makes me comfortable
xy0ZHMvvUnw,matt is the sort of person that could perfectly move the hand
xy0ZHMvvUnw,this is the weirdest game to do a recap on
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the hands extreme jiggling broke me i completely forgot how bad the wiis controls were lol
xy0ZHMvvUnw,this greatest recap went from innocent to very very effin dark fast
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the fact that he made a skit out of getting the motion controller settled on a games button is pure comedic genius
xy0ZHMvvUnw,despite it being a happy ending it still made me feel so bad for the poor mii
xy0ZHMvvUnw,you really knew to replicate that moment when the miis flip out after throwing the bowling ball backwards
xy0ZHMvvUnw,cant wait for the wii sports resort recap
xy0ZHMvvUnw,this brought back a lot of memories i remember that the ones i played the most were
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the excessive movement of the cursor is so accurate jesus
xy0ZHMvvUnw,if you can hear very carefully the miis steps sound exactly like in the mii channel subtle details that make shit better and perfect
xy0ZHMvvUnw,i loved the cursor jiggle you did that perfectly i wish i knew how you did that wiimote shatter at the end that was good
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the last one was kind of ironic everyone laughs when that actually happens in a game lol
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the bowling recap is dark as hell but it is accurate
xy0ZHMvvUnw,i love how at
xy0ZHMvvUnw,this video is the embodiment of they had us in the first half not gonna lie
xy0ZHMvvUnw,i waiting for the bowling one to come up throughout the entire video and had no idea it was gonna get that dark loved it
xy0ZHMvvUnw,theres no way this cartoon could turn dark
xy0ZHMvvUnw,once i saw that bowling was last and the fact that there is still like half the video left i figured something unusual was going to happen
xy0ZHMvvUnw,and so
xy0ZHMvvUnw,this is the funniest and most accurate thing ive seen today
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the most accurate part is the fact that matt from boxing is still out there wrecking peoples lives
xy0ZHMvvUnw,dang i felt emotional during the bowling part
xy0ZHMvvUnw,how the controller was launched in the tv just makes me feel nostalgic
xy0ZHMvvUnw,he perfectly captured wii sports alcohol suicide divorce and
xy0ZHMvvUnw,unrealistic forgot matt beating us everytime we play and hes there
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the end credit scene was phenomenal
xy0ZHMvvUnw,honestly i thought the overly violence was gonna be in boxing but it being in bowling because everyone throws the bowling ball back at least once is real smart
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the cursor got me cracking up so badly
xy0ZHMvvUnw,see in reality its actually an adventure game where the boss is the remote it was obviously the cause of the bowling accident
xy0ZHMvvUnw,incredible so funny and real
xy0ZHMvvUnw,that was perfect i love the animation
xy0ZHMvvUnw,this has more character development than the characters from netflix series
tZa4hs1MY3Y,her hear say testimony would never be allowed in a real court of law or trial why wont they bring the countering witness
tZa4hs1MY3Y,my favorite part of the hearing was at the end
tZa4hs1MY3Y,too good to verify as they say in the abc nbc cbs newsrooms
tZa4hs1MY3Y,then im sure theyll have no problem testifying under oath right
tZa4hs1MY3Y,the headline is secret service pushes back not someone said they pushed back etc  where is the official denial from the secret service  they can be given authority to testify
tZa4hs1MY3Y,if the secret service agents say she lied and the committee doesnt call them to testify  this will make this all a big waste of time
tZa4hs1MY3Y,anyone saying anything right now who is not under oath is frankly irrelevant
tZa4hs1MY3Y,isnt there video of arms flying around in that motorcade id like to hear testimony from these two agents denying that
tZa4hs1MY3Y,department of corrections stand back and stand by the testimony about inside the suv is actually hearsay in other words someone else heard it but the rest is not hearsay
tZa4hs1MY3Y,this is solid discourse good dialogue guys lmao
tZa4hs1MY3Y,i wouldnt be surprised if she has them or someone else discussing the story recorded it  the committee already have it
tZa4hs1MY3Y,if any of these secret service agents want to come forth under oath and testify they are welcome to do that
tZa4hs1MY3Y,they havent testified under oath so they havent pushed back yet
tZa4hs1MY3Y,i want to hear from the principal players engel and tony not just random secret service agents
tZa4hs1MY3Y,there was a reason pence didnt want to be in a confined space with secret service agents
tZa4hs1MY3Y,pushes back i guess or its they arent letting some random aide that wants spotlight to lie about the last man they had to protect with their lives
tZa4hs1MY3Y,her position within the west wing was specifically designed to help with these loose ended questions and she can connect what happened while the march was happening
tZa4hs1MY3Y,it seems to escape you that the committee brought her there to testify about something that she did not witness that in itself is telling
tZa4hs1MY3Y,the secret service agents may need to testify to explain what happened
tZa4hs1MY3Y,all it takes is to disprove one of her claims and shes toast
tZa4hs1MY3Y,anyone can push back on twitter in person on tv let them do it under auth with the penalty of purging themselves and facing prison for lying
tZa4hs1MY3Y,why is this the first time were hearing that they were armed
tZa4hs1MY3Y,the few knew jan 6 had plans coming i heard the senator talk about in dec
tZa4hs1MY3Y,i love how someone lies and pretty much the entire media and late night run with it without checking to see if it is true they keep falling for lies
tZa4hs1MY3Y,if she is lying why did they all ask for pardons
tZa4hs1MY3Y,which agents  this is simple produce the people who were in the room and have them say under oath if that conversation ever took place
tZa4hs1MY3Y,i wanna see that under oath i dont care for people making statements about witness testimony unless they are willing to sit for oath themselves
tZa4hs1MY3Y,well follow the facts where ever we want them to take us
tZa4hs1MY3Y,we all know what happened seriously this is now about how much they can prove
tZa4hs1MY3Y,if they dont push back under oath than it means nothing
tZa4hs1MY3Y,she related what she was told by people in the car the claim that trump wasnt worried about the crowd being armed was information was conversation directly heard by her
tZa4hs1MY3Y,the secret service needs to bring the videoaudio tapes from the beast on jan 6th so everyone can see and hear what happened during their deposition under oath
tZa4hs1MY3Y,its absurd theres no way he could have walked all the way to the capital 30 steps tops
tZa4hs1MY3Y,hmm i havent seen anyone else come forward and volunteer to refute anything
tZa4hs1MY3Y,i thought they were secret service agents
tZa4hs1MY3Y,but no recording of it since he was on camera the whole day
tZa4hs1MY3Y,im pretty sure there are cameras inside this socalled beast vehicle
tZa4hs1MY3Y,that agent needs a polygraph
tZa4hs1MY3Y,the secret service trying to push back on cassiday testimony is probably a bad call  stay secret and in the shadows  i just wouldnt touch that
tZa4hs1MY3Y,the true story will unfold when we see her next job appointment
tZa4hs1MY3Y,since when did hearsay become powerful statements
tZa4hs1MY3Y,when the denials come heavy you are spot on with the information
tZa4hs1MY3Y,my goodness the media are already defending her before hearing what the agents have to say
tZa4hs1MY3Y,you want to say same agents that vice president refused to seat in car with are saying that oh common who would guess that
tZa4hs1MY3Y,why even continue to discuss this if the law enforcers only give a two week sentence or house arrest
tZa4hs1MY3Y,it was all hearsay  and people believed it
tZa4hs1MY3Y,calling bs on the service
tZa4hs1MY3Y,looking forward to see her video testimony analyzed by the body language panel
tZa4hs1MY3Y,i want to hear from the fbi agents who served as agent provocateurs
tZa4hs1MY3Y,its amazing reading all of the comments that are parroting the media lie omg i wont believe it until they are under oath  hearsay cannot be used in court period
tZa4hs1MY3Y,secret service motto we protect liars who try to overnturn elections but we go after people who print a couple fake dollars
tZa4hs1MY3Y,how will legislators react
tZa4hs1MY3Y,its going to be funny when the secret tapes of the car ride come out proving don did assault a government official
tZa4hs1MY3Y,wow so much attention on a noncrime when do we have hearings on the leftist militias raping pillaging and murdering across our country for the last two years
tZa4hs1MY3Y,someone i know told a friend who told me the same thing i also need to testify
tZa4hs1MY3Y,they already have sworn statements from the named secret service agents corroborating the testimony it doesnt matter what the agency spin on it is
tZa4hs1MY3Y,this is the big lie thank you abc nbc cbs cnn
tZa4hs1MY3Y,a second hand account 
tZa4hs1MY3Y,no one can fit in a 3 inch window thats when i knew she was lying
tZa4hs1MY3Y,testamony was 100 hearsay and not admissable in court
tZa4hs1MY3Y,it appears the secret police are complicit
tZa4hs1MY3Y,you could see the lady was lying about the incident
tZa4hs1MY3Y,she didnt claim to have witnessed the motorcade incident she clearly said thats what she was told she was a firsthand witness to the other events
tZa4hs1MY3Y,3 branches of government legislative judicial and executive where does it say congress can hold trials thats the judicial branches job
tZa4hs1MY3Y,imagine having to admit the ss could not handle a tangerine
tZa4hs1MY3Y,tonys interview need to be released asap
tZa4hs1MY3Y,is there collaborating witnesses or denials where are others that were present
tZa4hs1MY3Y,they need to push back under oath and live otherwise irrelevant
tZa4hs1MY3Y,bendiciones hermosa celina que dios te cuidec donde quiera que
tZa4hs1MY3Y,when do all of the democrats and rinos come out of the little clown car
tZa4hs1MY3Y,they got all bases covered
tZa4hs1MY3Y,so as long as they are not her lies then the lies are okay to tell
tZa4hs1MY3Y,if anybody wants to call what she said a lie do it in from of the committee under oath soundbites and tweets dont count
tZa4hs1MY3Y,dont all ss agents wear microphones and maybe conversations are recorded and if so  those recordings are records they must keep by law for historical perspective

OMVdXAgXuoI,battlefield 5 did a lot of things wrong compared to its predecessor
OMVdXAgXuoI,battlefield 5 is truly amazing its so sad they abandoned it so fast
OMVdXAgXuoI,please make a battlefield 4 and 5 playlist i want to just binge watch you play them
OMVdXAgXuoI,this game is very underrated i think 2042 coming out also made us realise how good this was
OMVdXAgXuoI,just gotta say im so proud of you tbag
OMVdXAgXuoI,i absolutely love this game wish 2042 felt this smooth
OMVdXAgXuoI,i would really like to see a eastern front in bfv
OMVdXAgXuoI,bfv has great gunplay and great sniping it is incredibly satisfying and well done
OMVdXAgXuoI,regardless of how you feel about battlefield 5 it still gets the most players basically is always the number 1 battlefield on steam charts
OMVdXAgXuoI,this will always surprise me how every other battlefield game looks incredible compare to 2042 and they all still run better than 2042
OMVdXAgXuoI,man bf2042s setting was perfect for making the best battlefield game ever not too futuristic not too present time a perfect combination of both
OMVdXAgXuoI,bfv had some major flaws but the gunplay and movement were spot on imo better maps no attrition and a modern setting wouldve been a great fix for that formula
OMVdXAgXuoI,my favorite battlefield game but just to think what it couldve been
OMVdXAgXuoI,youre forgiven for the moment of zero aim ability tbag weve all been there
OMVdXAgXuoI,my only complaint about bf v was that everyone felt a bit bullet spongy
OMVdXAgXuoI,i appreciate you showing you missing your shots with the sniper rifle weve all been in the same situation
OMVdXAgXuoI,to this day it hurts me to see the empty firestorm servers
OMVdXAgXuoI,great to see the al sundan map getting some recognition its a snipers paradise and on breakthrough is immense
OMVdXAgXuoI,man imagine firestorm would be free to play
OMVdXAgXuoI,tbag 1 year ago bfv is dead its a lost cause                         tbag now no other game was like bfv
OMVdXAgXuoI,i love you so much tbag thanks for the memories of 2018 and the cuarentene
OMVdXAgXuoI,the gunplay and movement from bf5 combined with bf1 feeling of true war would be
OMVdXAgXuoI,love your videos ceep up the good work
OMVdXAgXuoI,i would like to see you make a video where it shows every time you got tbagged by a other person but then got revenge of them
OMVdXAgXuoI,trust me this is the best one they added enough maps and gear to solidify this game in the top spot for replay value
OMVdXAgXuoI,lady and gentleman you now gonna witness you aint promised to much
OMVdXAgXuoI,bro every time when i watch your videos  im like how is this guy still alive if i was in the situation i would have been dead
OMVdXAgXuoI,gunplay and movement in bfv is outstanding i still hate 2042 movement gunplay on console have improved a lot on 2042
OMVdXAgXuoI,glad to see you play some bfv again 
OMVdXAgXuoI,ea is too focused on representation and new and improved ways to report your fellow player for hurt feelings to actually make a good game
OMVdXAgXuoI,risen from the grave to live another day
OMVdXAgXuoI,this game was so fun to play during quarantine
OMVdXAgXuoI,eu prefiro jogar de de mmg ou lmg sempre na temtica do pas que eu t jogando assim da uma imerso muito boa
OMVdXAgXuoI,this probably has already been asked for but a worst to best video of bf4 would be pretty cool
OMVdXAgXuoI,i  absolutely love your videos
OMVdXAgXuoI,hey tbag i have a great idea you should maybe make a video on but basically using your favorite guns every battlefield game
OMVdXAgXuoI,really like the ots form dying light 2 on the background its suits a lot the situatuation
OMVdXAgXuoI,glad you are posting more frequently
OMVdXAgXuoI,tbag with at is surprisingly asmr
OMVdXAgXuoI,genuinely get excited when i see you post a video  by far my favourite youtuber
OMVdXAgXuoI,the ls26 is underated yet a fun gun to use
OMVdXAgXuoI,after all bfv wasnt that bad
OMVdXAgXuoI,love how half way through the video he puts on a dying light 2 soundtrack
OMVdXAgXuoI,lol i was not expecting firestorm gameplay in 2022
OMVdXAgXuoI,please rank every semi auto sniper rifle in bfv
OMVdXAgXuoI,every time you post im happy
OMVdXAgXuoI,the cod 4 music in the background when playing firestorm
OMVdXAgXuoI,battlefield v deserved so much more wish they never stopped making content to focus on battlefield 2042
OMVdXAgXuoI,honestly looking back bf5 was actually pretty good
OMVdXAgXuoI,i lost all hope for this franchise when bfv released im still playing bf1
OMVdXAgXuoI,bfv was only bad at content other than that it is the most advanced bf ever to walk on this planet
OMVdXAgXuoI,dice managed to take a step backwards in every important category of shooter
OMVdXAgXuoI,this is where we can see the start of ea fall apart and now being sold to either apple or microsoft
OMVdXAgXuoI,it still blows my mind of how bfv lacks so many iconic ww2 weapons
OMVdXAgXuoI,why would a masterpiece be treated as a dead game
OMVdXAgXuoI,in firestorm the way the fire engulf the map is pretty amazing
OMVdXAgXuoI,love firestorm content only 1 thing funy in bf5 plus im 17 in world on pc in solo wins
OMVdXAgXuoI,despite popular opinion bf1 and 5 are my fav battlefields in that order
OMVdXAgXuoI,yes finnaly battlefield v ive been waiting so long yessssssssss
OMVdXAgXuoI,the gunplay in bfv was too simplistic point and shoot no depth or variety at all when every gun can shoot with 100 accuracy
OMVdXAgXuoI,battlefield 1 is a behemoth but nobody can forget about battlefield 5
OMVdXAgXuoI,hey tbag i challenge you to play with my load out
OMVdXAgXuoI,one time i like to see battlefield 1 remastered
OMVdXAgXuoI,battlefield 5  4 literally have the best movement
OMVdXAgXuoI,i had a full lobby yesterday in firestorm
OMVdXAgXuoI,its the best playable shooter outhere for now according to me
OMVdXAgXuoI,tbag missing easiest shot in battelfield 5  omg i am so bad
OMVdXAgXuoI,that medal of honor music makes the gameplay way more interesting
OMVdXAgXuoI,concept ease of nautical trolling or an eod bot episode
OMVdXAgXuoI,as much as i love battlefield 5 battlefield 1 does it better imo
OMVdXAgXuoI,i dont know if im blind or what but i still cant see the enemy player in this game
OMVdXAgXuoI,if 16 people are playing and thats a quarter of capacity then its 75 dead not 100
OMVdXAgXuoI,could you rank every pixel in bf5
OMVdXAgXuoI,me here again asking for historically accurate doors in bf1 ranked from worst to best
OMVdXAgXuoI,i remember when you said before the launch of 2042 that you probably wouldnt do many og battlefield game videos but now you are not playing 2042 anymore
OMVdXAgXuoI,iam literally rank 121 and my best kill streak is 18 yesterday i met a lvl 8 hacker yes bfv on pc is like bf2042 on ps4
OMVdXAgXuoI,firestorm could be so much fun if people actually played
OMVdXAgXuoI,i hate some of the games sound design and all the female characters in each faction but overall i still am enjoying it
OMVdXAgXuoI,i can never work out tbags accent
OMVdXAgXuoI,rank all bf1 operations from worst to best
OMVdXAgXuoI,dice needs to revive bfv finish what they started
OMVdXAgXuoI,still a great game

cJhCHvovoBY,only jiri andmen in their sixties at your local fitness center are doing the 2 step like that on a treadmill im jealous
cJhCHvovoBY,can we all pretend glovers polish friend is jan
cJhCHvovoBY,jiri reminds me of that guy from the movie kickboxer where hes kicking a beam and knocking the dust out the ceiling
cJhCHvovoBY,im excited to see how far jiri can take this unorthodox approach i dont see his fundamentals as solid as they should be
cJhCHvovoBY,love how brown and teixeira turned their play roll into a real roll
15XYfjp9lso,adam trying to communicate better has been one of the most wholesome moments this season
15XYfjp9lso,adam and ruby bonding with each other was a moment i never knew i needed hope they have more screen time next season as friends
15XYfjp9lso,i cant believe that this season made me feel sorry for ruby since she genuinely loved otis still it was sweet that olivia and anwar comforted her
15XYfjp9lso,everybody should thank adam in this scene if he never watched the kardashians then this would have been a big fail also ruby  otis chemistry is so good
15XYfjp9lso,adam trying so hard for eric is the nicest thing
15XYfjp9lso,adam and ruby carried the whole season
15XYfjp9lso,at first i thought this would be a chaos but damn their chemistry lol
15XYfjp9lso,ruby and adams backs must be sore for carrying the whole season
15XYfjp9lso,i love seeing my queen ruby enjoying herself with otis she looks so happy here
15XYfjp9lso,while it was admirable of eric to stick up for himself he should have done it in a better way than cheating on adam
15XYfjp9lso,i hope to see more adam and ruby friendship in a platonic way look at their chemistry as friends bffs goals i hope so
15XYfjp9lso,i was laughing out loud when adam asked anyone who smell their own farts omg how can they even pull a straight face on that
15XYfjp9lso,yall better give us more ruby and adam next season
15XYfjp9lso,the way adam convey his thoughts about olas feeling with this new family thing was well written
15XYfjp9lso,im disappointed that they ended otis and rubys romance it was so good and too short
15XYfjp9lso,petition to make ruby  otis to be a endgame
15XYfjp9lso,one of the best scenes from this season sad both couples are broken up but well see in season 4
15XYfjp9lso,i love how they humanise ruby character without changing her personality at all
15XYfjp9lso,the more im gonna watch anything related to ot and rubes the more im gonna cry thinking they arent together the girl literally cried for him
15XYfjp9lso,theres an opinion that ruby confessed her feelings towards otis way to soon but actually shes been holding it for a while since s2e7 i guess45 months
15XYfjp9lso,adam anyone who smell their own farts
15XYfjp9lso,i am living for erics what on
15XYfjp9lso,everybody talking wa about rubyotis but im genuinely sad for adam his chara developement was amazing he deserves as much as ruby
15XYfjp9lso,otis and ruby have insane chemistry they are like each others missing pieces definitely should be endgame if theres a season 4
15XYfjp9lso,honestly think this double date was the best 4 minutes in all 3 seasons it was amazing
15XYfjp9lso,really love ruby in this season her and otis relationship was really good if they where to get back together i wont have an issue at all
15XYfjp9lso,the writers did such a good job with adams character development this season i wasnt expecting it
15XYfjp9lso,am i the only one who cant stop watching youtube videos of otis and ruby after watching the third season i still think they are the best couple
15XYfjp9lso,adam and rubys character development has been so great the past season and i want to see more screen time for both of them
15XYfjp9lso,this was one of the best scenes in the show the comedy the passion ruby opening up and the couples supporting each other
15XYfjp9lso,tbh otis and maeve are just really good as friends and otis should give another shot at not casual things with ruby he rlly brought out the best in her
15XYfjp9lso,the moment at
15XYfjp9lso,everytime i see otis approach eric for the hug in the beginning makes me go awww their friendship is so warm
15XYfjp9lso,i love this scene so much no conflicts no drama just good vibes we love to see it and adams little stain on his hoodie gaaahhh hes my favorite
15XYfjp9lso,ruby and adam carrying this date is a metaphor for them carrying the season dont argue with me i know im right
15XYfjp9lso,filled with emotion and comedy just makes you feel good watching it best scene of the season
15XYfjp9lso,this was when i actually started to like otis and ruby because it didnt feel like she was pretending and looked like she was actually having fun
15XYfjp9lso,one of the best scenes in ss3 they made my heart full of joyness
15XYfjp9lso,i love how awkward it is at the beginning and how cute it ends up being
15XYfjp9lso,when i tell you ruby  otis was the relationship i never saw coming and didnt even know i needed i just love these two chemistry and wanted so much more
15XYfjp9lso,i love how they pay the whole scene as a homage to the big lebowsky with the bowling and the song choice
15XYfjp9lso,this my most fave scene in the series ive already watched this multiple times and i never get tired of it lol i want to experience something like this
15XYfjp9lso,the double date  all the way through rubys home  is my favorite scene
15XYfjp9lso,this scene was unbearable at first then quickly became one of my favourite scenes in season 3 and probably the whole show
15XYfjp9lso,i just want ruby and otis to get back together omg
15XYfjp9lso,adam went from being a character i wasnt fond of to being my favourite male character in the show love his character development as the show progressed
15XYfjp9lso,love the big lebowski reference especially adam and his bowling ball
15XYfjp9lso,i freaking loved ruby this season kinda upset that they forget about her for the last half of the season ultimately i think her and otis have better chemistry
15XYfjp9lso,team ruby
15XYfjp9lso,ill just say that adam is literally my favorite character in the entire show its so sweet to see him genuinely communicating 
15XYfjp9lso,the group dynamic is honestly one the best and thats a fact
15XYfjp9lso,i love when ruby and adam truly feels happy
15XYfjp9lso,the actress who plays ruby is just too good loveable she makes being mean look charming she better get a happy ending
15XYfjp9lso,hands down the best episode of the season i absolutely love otis and rubys relationship and it made me so devastated when it ended
15XYfjp9lso,i would love to see more of them as friends the four together realy had good chemistry
15XYfjp9lso,it was so sad to see eric break adams heart adam trying his best not to cry was so painful
15XYfjp9lso,that was my favorite scene ever in sex education look how they are chemistryi hope otis and ruby back together in season4
15XYfjp9lso,one of my favorite moments from the new season i love how it started awkward but they ended up having so much fun
15XYfjp9lso,i fully cried with happiness watching them have fun bowling together
15XYfjp9lso,i know adam stole the show and this is my fave scene of the entire season but erics facial expressions also had me
15XYfjp9lso,all throughout the show ive never had this much butterflies as much as i have with these two together
15XYfjp9lso,i love how this show can bring the most unconventional chemistry with characters
15XYfjp9lso,we need more ruby and adam next season i want them and rahim to be the new clique
15XYfjp9lso,shipping otis and maeve since season 1 but now i think we all want ruby and otis to be the endgame
15XYfjp9lso,adam stole this scene the depth of his character is unmatched my fav character in this season
15XYfjp9lso,i hope ruby and otis get back together in season 4
15XYfjp9lso,ruby stands out in season 3 she is a good girl and she is so brave and tell otis that she loves him
15XYfjp9lso,this is one of the most wholesome and cutest scenes in whole of the season
15XYfjp9lso,the season 3 is so wholesome thanks netflix the chemistry bw ruby and otis is one of the best i have ever seen
15XYfjp9lso,best scene of the whole season 3 for me so happy and wholesome x
15XYfjp9lso,i love ruby fighting the new headmistress so much lmaooo if anyone isnt afraid of her its gotta be the mean girl
15XYfjp9lso,netflix please give me more ruby  otis

eWbQFZWroDs,every time i hear about the cost of american schools i appreciate my countrys free education a lot more
eWbQFZWroDs,love how jason is portrayed as matpats dad in the beginning of the episode hahaha
eWbQFZWroDs,to do chich fila you also have to be okay with the money you make going to campaigns to legalize the murder of lgbt people in other countries
eWbQFZWroDs,in defense of college i think an important point to realize here is that the benefit of modern university is not at all education learning concepts or training
eWbQFZWroDs,its nice to see more people stray from the way of thinking that college needs to be mandatory in order to earn a decent living
eWbQFZWroDs,from theories to giving life advice matpat has truly come a long way
eWbQFZWroDs,i must say this im sure for a fact i learned more in the 5 years i watched this channel than anything my school would even dream of
eWbQFZWroDs,really were not going to have any discussion about what chikfila are going to be looking for in those interviews
eWbQFZWroDs,you must participate in group prayers during training and management meetings and although you dont have to be a christian you must promote christian values
eWbQFZWroDs,may i just say that matpat nailed the experience of working at chikfila they are literally always watching and checking
eWbQFZWroDs,i love how food theory makes videos about things nobody else would even think of
eWbQFZWroDs,honestly loved this video ive been thinking of saving to eventually become a franchisee and this makes it seem actually doable
eWbQFZWroDs,id like to thank this video for being my inspiration for starting a franchise business
eWbQFZWroDs,i love how much work he puts into these videos to result in this
eWbQFZWroDs,anyone else catch that
eWbQFZWroDs,i cant imagine what trying to get your food from the cafeteria in a food theory school would be like
eWbQFZWroDs,freaking love your videos man keep it up
eWbQFZWroDs,you must be willing to participate in group prayers during training
eWbQFZWroDs,now my teacher has no excuse whenever i fail a test thanks matpat d
eWbQFZWroDs,i definitely agree with this theory college is too expensive and unless it gets cheaper then your better off owning a qsr
eWbQFZWroDs,i think id rather die than own a branch of one of the many corporations that want me dead
eWbQFZWroDs,love your content keep up the good work and great theory matpat
eWbQFZWroDs,is it me or am i enjoying this channel more than i am the other theory channels
eWbQFZWroDs,i love the videos about the business side of restaurants keep this up
eWbQFZWroDs,my teacher legit had this idea as well i cant wait to show them this video
eWbQFZWroDs,matpat says you should do a franchise and not go to college
eWbQFZWroDs,love this so sad that this society puts so much weight on college degrees
eWbQFZWroDs,i think i would pass on that one theres too much controversy to do with that place so no thank you
eWbQFZWroDs,mattpatt i am very disappointed that you not only made a video about bigoted chicken but you actively go there you are not an ally to the lgbt
eWbQFZWroDs,it would be so fun if matpat and steph made an online theory school i would come everyday
eWbQFZWroDs,being able to head back in a video in  makes me so happy knowing that this channel keeps posting enough to do that like the other channels
eWbQFZWroDs,i think the thing i love the most bout this channel is that just bout everytime i see the intro i discover something new everytime
eWbQFZWroDs,food theory do box tops actually work or the history of them im curious
eWbQFZWroDs,i was literally just thinking man i dont understand how those multimillion food industries only pay minimum wage when theyve got hundreds of millions of dollars under their belt
eWbQFZWroDs,isnt necessarily a food theory but toothpaste always says x10 dentists agree but its never 10 what would be the perfect toothpaste that makes 1010 dentists agree to use it
eWbQFZWroDs,after watching this im starting to question if my college years are actually wasteful
eWbQFZWroDs,im going to send this to my history teacher and i
eWbQFZWroDs,matpat has become the best personal financial counselor
eWbQFZWroDs,the question is will someone have the knowledge or background to run a whole restaurant after high school
eWbQFZWroDs,i can always tell when the manager is off at my nearby fast food places presence shows in the quality of food and service
eWbQFZWroDs,makes me so proud of my mom for owning one haha
eWbQFZWroDs,anyone else notice that whenever he said tacobell it highlighted  jackinabox
eWbQFZWroDs,this is probably the only food theory episode talking positive things about a fast food franchise
eWbQFZWroDs,considering the companys background and views it doesnt surprise me it would be more difficult to own one than to get into a prestigious university
eWbQFZWroDs,ah yes another matpat video that reminds me why i have depression and anxiety and have decided to not have kids
eWbQFZWroDs,i do not abide by the homophobia chicken house
eWbQFZWroDs,he may be setting me up for more dentist appointment by telling me to eat chocolate over salad at least hes setting up my future
eWbQFZWroDs,i dont know what channel this would apply to but id love to get a theory on whether there are more wheels or doors in the world
eWbQFZWroDs,one problem matpat
eWbQFZWroDs,i worked at chicfila for about half a year and i will say they definitely have the highest standards for everything they are constantly micro managing
eWbQFZWroDs,a lot of ppl have found that sticking with a fast food job and making your way to owning a chain is actually pretty rewarding
eWbQFZWroDs,you should definitely do a theory on the best franchise to own

WAWXj3GE9Tg,disgusting and unacceptable
WAWXj3GE9Tg,he obviously ended it as soon as he got into office the supreme courts decision doesnt change much it just gives incentive for even more people to come
WAWXj3GE9Tg,im saddened by this decision it worked and we really need it to stay in place the border is overwhelmed with immigrants
WAWXj3GE9Tg,well if its a policy by one president it can be reversed by another  that is the problem when congress doesnt make actual laws to stop illegal immigration
WAWXj3GE9Tg,missing president trump yet
WAWXj3GE9Tg,good bye amerikait was nice knowing you
WAWXj3GE9Tg,this is what a career in politics creates
WAWXj3GE9Tg,biden could wrap his own presents and still throw himself a surprise party on
WAWXj3GE9Tg,in the last days lawlessness will abound
WAWXj3GE9Tg,this is a green light for the cartels and drug dealers
WAWXj3GE9Tg,dont i wish i could go to another country and live just by walking across the border
WAWXj3GE9Tg,no repercussions no consequence no accountabilityone could define this as the current administrations self inflicted woes in one wordlawlessness
WAWXj3GE9Tg,corporate media never felt a amount of pain they deserve for what theyve done into our society
WAWXj3GE9Tg,lol if it wasnt clear before whats happening it should be now
WAWXj3GE9Tg,were living in unprecedented times in the us scary thanks joey
WAWXj3GE9Tg,pure bull
WAWXj3GE9Tg,whats the point of being a citizen when people can illegally come here and reap most of the benefits with almost none of the taxation
WAWXj3GE9Tg,going to be like when they open the gates at disneyland the only difference is they all get in for free
WAWXj3GE9Tg,we need voter id laws
WAWXj3GE9Tg,the hell with the sc we will defy them where did i hear that before the american people should be holding hands at the southern border stopping this bs
WAWXj3GE9Tg,such a great victory for our commander in chief can someone explain how this is good for america
WAWXj3GE9Tg,treat the migrants with respect
WAWXj3GE9Tg,what borderthe united states is a wide open territory
WAWXj3GE9Tg,so the pandemic is over
WAWXj3GE9Tg,as bad as the border situation is this should have been a slam dunk to not rescind a bone for payback smh
WAWXj3GE9Tg,at least we have the right to defend ourselves against the dangerous criminals being released into our streets
WAWXj3GE9Tg,i am sickened by this i live in south texas and its a dangerous time apparently its going to get worse now that drug cartels have carte blanche ugh
WAWXj3GE9Tg,so much for the pledge of allegiance
WAWXj3GE9Tg,texas is about tired of this horrific invasion
WAWXj3GE9Tg,investigate the supreme court vote them out and biden too
WAWXj3GE9Tg,lets go brandon hail the maga king fjb
WAWXj3GE9Tg,make the democrats pay at the polls vote like your life and your childrens lives depend on itbecause they do
WAWXj3GE9Tg,overturning roevwade allowing protective carry nice but agreeing to this
WAWXj3GE9Tg,i guess someones been threatening their families not surprising
WAWXj3GE9Tg,hell  fall up  the  stairs  to  tell you  how  great  this  is  this is going to ten times the amount to come now
WAWXj3GE9Tg,just importing the new democratic voters
WAWXj3GE9Tg,feel sorry for biden
WAWXj3GE9Tg,if only these supreme justices lived here in the border theyll see the damage going on
WAWXj3GE9Tg,what biden said at nato summit in madrid 
WAWXj3GE9Tg,he has ignored this for most of his term there by violating the law impeach him
WAWXj3GE9Tg,impeach those  kick them out of supreme court  put them in their own houses
WAWXj3GE9Tg,if you are ok with this judgement please explain the logic to me im open to the idea that perhaps im missing something
WAWXj3GE9Tg,supreme court justices who have had illegal protesters in their neighborhood should have shown more compassion for the families living on the southern border
WAWXj3GE9Tg,biden and biden led politicians have opted for a new and improved policy  its called  remain in cargo containers
WAWXj3GE9Tg,i see our taxes going up again and again and again
WAWXj3GE9Tg,looks like will be paying more for these people
WAWXj3GE9Tg,we can only hope biden cancels remain in mexico  that is going to be the last reason independents need to support the red wave
WAWXj3GE9Tg,and he cant figure out why no one supports his desire to run again 
WAWXj3GE9Tg,it is good to see the supreme court thinks for itself and by the law i may not like this descision but i will respect the court fir it
WAWXj3GE9Tg,im saddened by this and im over my tax money going to pay for these illegal immigrants to have things the american people are doing without
WAWXj3GE9Tg,there should be term limits for every job and for everyposition from top to btm
WAWXj3GE9Tg,this is insane  wow
WAWXj3GE9Tg,this is going to be the end of us as we know it
WAWXj3GE9Tg,thanks to roberts and kavanaugh must be a trade off for the roe v wade decision
WAWXj3GE9Tg,wow ok i wonder if they realize what is going on at the border this is saddening
WAWXj3GE9Tg,so on other words its gonna be like its always been
WAWXj3GE9Tg,here comes a bunch of new voters for biden
WAWXj3GE9Tg,really like the us isnt in enough trouble with illegal immigrants
WAWXj3GE9Tg,i foresee a lot more homeless tents being put up in the near future
WAWXj3GE9Tg,necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves
WAWXj3GE9Tg,so protecting our soverign borders ts now unconstitutional
WAWXj3GE9Tg,so where are the addresses for us to peacefully protest this asking for a friend
WAWXj3GE9Tg,how about a remain in delaware policy  resident biden wants them here so bad why not remain with him  lets go brandon 
WAWXj3GE9Tg,they sent it back down to the appellate courts for litigation and further rulings  so the circuit courts can still rule that remain in mexico is still legal
WAWXj3GE9Tg,horrible news for america
WAWXj3GE9Tg,treat them with respect and dignity then they will keep coming they are criminals and should be treated as such
WAWXj3GE9Tg,country is in total danger we are destroyed
WAWXj3GE9Tg,doesnt matter how they rule joe does what ever he wants
WAWXj3GE9Tg,well here comes more drug dealers
WAWXj3GE9Tg,this is still a loss for the dems now they will have to answer to the people on why they want open borders
WAWXj3GE9Tg,the judge who stopped it on no merits at all should be sued
WAWXj3GE9Tg,no ones waited in mexico since joe was inserted
WAWXj3GE9Tg,this just after 50 immigrants found dead in a truck  well done
WAWXj3GE9Tg,after insulting them does joe think they are going to be on his side
WAWXj3GE9Tg,it is easy to say you want open borders when you do not live in a border state
WAWXj3GE9Tg,god help our country
WAWXj3GE9Tg,i prefer dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery
WAWXj3GE9Tg,here we go million coming
WAWXj3GE9Tg,as a comedian if im not crossing the line then im doing my job
WAWXj3GE9Tg,kavanaugh has been such a disappointment
WAWXj3GE9Tg,how can they vote against the sovereignty of our nation
g-_hVXzkn0o,jeff really giving us a proper reality check td
g-_hVXzkn0o,continue to learn to code and try to create value for other people
g-_hVXzkn0o,this was my favorite coding channel now its also my favorite news channel
g-_hVXzkn0o,sometimes i dont like working for megacorp inc but on days like this im reminded why im always wary of working for unicorn companies
g-_hVXzkn0o,thats great to hear as a student that will get into work life in a few years
g-_hVXzkn0o,i am a simple javascript developer and that makes me as resilient as cockroach
g-_hVXzkn0o,i love how you tell it like it is rich got richer that transitory inflation was not transitory at all and a lot of tech companies are wildly overvalued
g-_hVXzkn0o,now i realize that this video sounds very pessimistic but just remember that things can always get a lot worse
g-_hVXzkn0o,normally trendy tech coders online dont understand politicseconomics but you sir got it right and explained it well
g-_hVXzkn0o,to me it all sounds like good news honestly it feels like were passing through a strainer the bad stuff stays where its at and the good stuff goes on
g-_hVXzkn0o,there will always be a demand for practical developers who can actually do stuff
g-_hVXzkn0o,to be fair everything is down because of the thought of a looming recession
g-_hVXzkn0o,as someone with a degree in economics and almost a degree in software engineering  i appreciate the insight jeff brings to economics visavis the software world
g-_hVXzkn0o,the belt curve applies to every industry it cant always keep growing at break neck pace its inevitable theres limits to every market it will come back again
g-_hVXzkn0o,whether coding news or any other content this channel is on another level cheers
g-_hVXzkn0o,i feel like ive been through 3 recessions and im only in my 20s the random seed events  in life has taken a mind of its own
g-_hVXzkn0o,this channel always delivers on fantastic tech content  informative succinct memeheavy now based and erudite takes on the news christmas has come early this year
g-_hVXzkn0o,i mean as long as internet exists we gonna need developers
g-_hVXzkn0o,wanna say thank you for jeff mom raised person who can talk about devs tech business economics at once properly and educate people
g-_hVXzkn0o,so not only you can code and teach it but you also have some excellent general worldview worthy opinions great jeff keep up the great work inspirational
g-_hVXzkn0o,a month later mgs missile guidance systems in 100 seconds
g-_hVXzkn0o,thanks for this
g-_hVXzkn0o,wow i wasnt expecting this from a coding channel you know your stuff
g-_hVXzkn0o,im not an economist  but i think this whole thing is supported with the fears of more likely incoming economic stagnation
g-_hVXzkn0o,this is the type of report we need to see on tv quick and very efficient
g-_hVXzkn0o,this is the best tech channel i found recently thank youfor all this awesome content
g-_hVXzkn0o,surprisingly level headed analysis for a coding channel haha
g-_hVXzkn0o,thanks man keeping it real anything can get worse ive absolutely come to that conclusion lol
g-_hVXzkn0o,possibly the most useful 3mins of my week solid video packed full of info and memes pure perfection
g-_hVXzkn0o,i have to say this video has a different vibe than most of the content i watched on this channel so far but is still very informative
g-_hVXzkn0o,well when the layoffs really pick up learning to code may also really pick up  or just the opposite
g-_hVXzkn0o,though the entire video was scary you shoot up our motivation by saying will continue to code
g-_hVXzkn0o,what i think we are seeing is bad ideas finally having a cost
g-_hVXzkn0o,spot on its really time to end the whole silicon valley vc racket but i dont think its going anywhere
g-_hVXzkn0o,im so glad to be a computer scientist going into the tech industry right now
g-_hVXzkn0o,i agree with everything except one thing stimmies are not the reason for the inflation quantitative easing is
g-_hVXzkn0o,love you videos man far and away my favourite coding channel
g-_hVXzkn0o,having witnessed 2001 and personally experienced 2007 2020 and now 2022 what do i see in the next year opportunity
g-_hVXzkn0o,in this 3 min i learn many things which i cant even learn in 3 months thanks man
g-_hVXzkn0o,thanks jeff for giving a summary of whats going on on the other side of my world
g-_hVXzkn0o,couldnt agree more all that you said can be translated into the market is driven by hype and emotions not by fundamentals untill hype ends and real life kicks in
g-_hVXzkn0o,very interesting overview thank you for putting it together
g-_hVXzkn0o,welp i was hoping i could at least get my first job as a developer before a bunch of companies decided they no longer needed developers
g-_hVXzkn0o,shopify has also been on a massive hiring spree upping costs but alot is for engineering and over the last year there have been noticeable feature releases and improvements
g-_hVXzkn0o,how can you be that good at what you do its amazing
g-_hVXzkn0o,they will keep doing what theyre doing bubbles will come and bust but as long as you have skills you will be employable and earn a living
g-_hVXzkn0o,just keep on coding and keep on delivering value all you need to do
g-_hVXzkn0o,you have really great content keep it up man
g-_hVXzkn0o,great vid
g-_hVXzkn0o,your videos are freaking awesome  thanks
g-_hVXzkn0o,fing love this channel haha but seriously it could be a good thing companies that actually make a profit will still be around
g-_hVXzkn0o,you know its bad when your friendly neighborhood programmer talks about the stock market crash
g-_hVXzkn0o,man youre killing it with whatever you decide on covering
g-_hVXzkn0o,awesome video jeff
g-_hVXzkn0o,your final sentence is where its at creating actual value is what matters
g-_hVXzkn0o,moments like this are the best opportunity to find good companies
g-_hVXzkn0o,im going to continue coding but im going to focus on value for myself before others
hQtb20i40lU,the roads are a huge difference they actually have detail and texture now
hQtb20i40lU,the nrburgring is massively different  i feel like the gradients are more obvious now
hQtb20i40lU,the wind effects add much needed realism still driveclub from 2014 has the best precipitation effects ive ever seen from a game
hQtb20i40lU,gran turismo is my childhood from the ps1 days and the car details are so damn beautiful i feel that the environmental designs in the forza series are better though
hQtb20i40lU,was checking your channel page last night waiting for this one to drop this is probably my most anticipated direct comparison from you yet
hQtb20i40lU,while watching this video i realise how damn good gt sport actually looks
hQtb20i40lU,when you use anti lag there attentiom to detail where you gotta wait for the muffler to get hot enough to ignite flames more aggressive just like in real life
hQtb20i40lU,its literally the same game but with better reflections and a bit higher textures gran turismo 7 feels like gran turismo sport remastered
hQtb20i40lU,i always anticipate one of these videos whenever a new racing game drops
hQtb20i40lU,the priotize framerate mode on gt7 will make the photo and replay modes look more like gameplay
hQtb20i40lU,this reflection effect over the cars is too much and distracting they should decrease it a lot in the next patches other than that is an awesome looking game
hQtb20i40lU,you missed one major point gt7 finally has that interior camera shake option which can be found in other games like project cars this was not featured in gtsport
hQtb20i40lU,game looks amazing but the little effects they gotta work on especially when you crash because nfs unleashed had amazing effects
hQtb20i40lU,my only issue with gt sound is how the cars sound when they shift everything else is great for me
hQtb20i40lU,gts had good audio amazing compared to gt6 but gt7 i could tell you were driving a porsche without seeing it which is another level of audio accuracy
hQtb20i40lU,i love these videos
hQtb20i40lU,such an awesome game
hQtb20i40lU,after seeing this video i feel like sony could do better you have pointed many aspects that could have been improved buy they havent thank you for the video
hQtb20i40lU,love them both although 7 is more presentable which draws me in
hQtb20i40lU,i would have liked using my own music tracks while driving street cars at least it just seems natural to do so in a car
hQtb20i40lU,you said the plume of the lighting or reflections seem to much
hQtb20i40lU,i havet played any racing game for a while but somehow gt sports looks more real in some comparisons
hQtb20i40lU,seriously i have been waiting for this video from you man love your in depth analysis on games
hQtb20i40lU,this comparison video turned out to be a great review of gt7
hQtb20i40lU,graphics improved but interface and features like breaking cones and selling cars are better in gt sport
hQtb20i40lU,most of the changes in gran turismo 7 are good but their is some changes in id like to see improve thats if the time comes
hQtb20i40lU,amazing videos man very well done  can you do a fh5 compared to gt7 that would be dope
hQtb20i40lU,i miss the bspec feature and also the class level career progression
hQtb20i40lU,great comparison and review
hQtb20i40lU,awesome content i could be fooled if you had a digital foundry logo in your video keep up
hQtb20i40lU,the bloom effect is like having cataracts disease  hope they turn it a bit down
hQtb20i40lU,love the wind noise they added in gt7
hQtb20i40lU,from what i am seeing i think i like gt sport more but i want to get gt7 for the single player campaign and ability to modify your cars
hQtb20i40lU,it would be nice to see this same compression done on ps4 pro also
hQtb20i40lU,it looks like they will soften the shadows with a patch rest everything looks good
hQtb20i40lU,im really liking how good gt7 looks but that bloom effect on all the reflections is really annoying  is there a way to turn down the glare
hQtb20i40lU,it is basically the same core game with new menus and beefed up graphics more of an update than really a new game i still like it anyways
hQtb20i40lU,an interesting direct comparison would be gt7 vs forza motorsport reboot whenever that gets released
hQtb20i40lU,amazing review
hQtb20i40lU,been waiting for this one for a long time
hQtb20i40lU,holy heavens simply watching that final clip of you hydroplaning a 458 in the raindrenched night gave me anxiety this is about to be a blast
hQtb20i40lU,the smoke particle effect is also something gt 7 went to home with
hQtb20i40lU,this is like an enhanced sport versin
hQtb20i40lU,much more beautiful cars and tracks are clean and crisp very detailed no need better car sounds are fine tuned too
hQtb20i40lU,i dont know why but for me the graphics in gt7 feels more cartoonisharcadeish than other racing games today
hQtb20i40lU,decent upgrade on gts but certainly not overawed by it as its supposed to be a next gen release the online aspect has been ruined already
hQtb20i40lU,this feels like the update rockstar games are doing with gtav for ps5 and xbox series its a decent but slight improvement overall is it worth the full 60
hQtb20i40lU,it would be cool a comparison between gt and forza
hQtb20i40lU,i feel like the photo mode in every game increases the graphics fidelity
hQtb20i40lU,the screach from the cut gears really botherd me in gt sport so im glad that its toned down abit even though its loud af in real life
hQtb20i40lU,another great video
hQtb20i40lU,i really wish if you can make a direct comparison between assassins creed syndicate vs unity
hQtb20i40lU,other than the roads and some reflections only artistic differences
hQtb20i40lU,not gonna lie this doesnt feel next gen theres low for todays standard polygon some models obvious that much was recycled
hQtb20i40lU,you can tell this game isnt a true showcase and that it is made on the gt sport engine but it still looks spectacular

9EitxdKVDd0,wasnt no mystery guy been looking sick
9EitxdKVDd0,pancreatitis is travis a heavy alcohol drinker or taking excessive meds that could explain the diagnosis pancreatitis is very painful
9EitxdKVDd0,wishing mr barker a speedy recovery was he vaccinated ive heard stories about various organ  heart  blood pressure issues sometime afterwards

9EitxdKVDd0,sad but the fact that travis is married to kourtney kardashian is the most upsetting news here
9EitxdKVDd0,after watching father stu   i believe that god has chosen him to praise his name

9EitxdKVDd0,oh snap no wonder hes daughter put send ur prayers on her story i was confused
9EitxdKVDd0,the kardashian curse

9EitxdKVDd0,spending too much time with mgk
9EitxdKVDd0,he is pregnant
9EitxdKVDd0,was he vaccinated
9EitxdKVDd0,i was hospitalized for pancreatitis and it the worst pain ever
9EitxdKVDd0,he must did drugs  drinking when he was younger
9EitxdKVDd0,damn kardashiansyou couldnt pay me to marry one of themunless i wanted to become a drug addict crippled or dead at 30 years old
9EitxdKVDd0,i guess all that gluten free vegan  sugar free  ayurvedic medicine crap that kourtney swears by is useless
9EitxdKVDd0,good luck
9EitxdKVDd0,he survived mtv a plane crash the death of his friend from the plane crash an ungodly amount of tattoos ptsd and pancreatitiscan he survive the dreaded kardashian cartel
9EitxdKVDd0,he is healead in jesus name amen
9EitxdKVDd0,maybe he should stop drinkingidk
9EitxdKVDd0,cool so theres no mystery its pancreatitis smh
9EitxdKVDd0,hope kourtney isnt controlling what hes eating
9EitxdKVDd0,it was pancreatitis
9EitxdKVDd0,its malnutrition
9EitxdKVDd0,probably from the weird diet kourtney is making him do
9EitxdKVDd0,could it be covidvaccinitis
9EitxdKVDd0,the jabdemic strikes another actor with a mysterious illness

9EitxdKVDd0,i think all the stuff kourtney is making him do is making him sick
9EitxdKVDd0,he couldnt keep up with tlhe kardashians too much bs going on
9EitxdKVDd0,i guess maybe this is what happens when you marry a kardashian
9EitxdKVDd0,never go full vegan
9EitxdKVDd0,pda disease
9EitxdKVDd0,dear heavenly father  if it is you will to help this family conceive  conception  amen  thank you jesus

VxoXfpr6spc,guy has an existential crisis whilst speedrunning a popular game altered for educational purposes
VxoXfpr6spc,fun fact the education edition is in bedrock edition and in bedrock edition there is a chance that a stronghold spawns without a portal room
VxoXfpr6spc,i loved watching a java player fight the bedrock ender dragon and fail miserably since all java players ever seem to say is that java is way harder than bedrock
VxoXfpr6spc,in bedrock sometimes portals are just that hard to find i remember blowing up a stronghold for like an hour then finally finding the portal
VxoXfpr6spc,yes in bedrock edition is very difficult to fight the dragon and its more aggressive
VxoXfpr6spc,i love the way he makes everything heroic as if its in an old tale at least everything after the stronghold
VxoXfpr6spc,java edition you one cycle the dragon in speedruns
VxoXfpr6spc,after seeing this made me realize that as a bedrock player who didnt notice before bedrock is harder other than the pvp pvp is probably easy because mobile players tho
VxoXfpr6spc,the most emotional speedrun ive ever seen i almost cried though
VxoXfpr6spc,this went from a speedrun into an epic tale with a whole ass redemption arc
VxoXfpr6spc,wondering why this stupid green villager wouldnt aid me in my quest
VxoXfpr6spc,i feel like hes the type of guy to just restart a game because he chose an option that made a npc sad prove me wrong
VxoXfpr6spc,i like how a java player really got a taste of what bedrock is like i do wish he fought the bedrock wither
VxoXfpr6spc,wow its amazing how someone could actually give a good description within the game without crying by being tired good job man you deserve a sub
VxoXfpr6spc,ive gotten really good at speedrunning education edition after i saw a lot of my friends do it my best is
VxoXfpr6spc,it went from speedrun to great teaching moments lol great job
VxoXfpr6spc,this is insane this guy commentates so well he should start telling online stories very good and entertaining video keep it up
VxoXfpr6spc,teacher okay so basically mitochondria is the powerho
VxoXfpr6spc,his commentary makes everything dramatic and i love it
VxoXfpr6spc,imagine youre trying to teach your class things and one kid is busy speed running minecraft
VxoXfpr6spc,id never played java edition before but as a bedrock player i feel this
VxoXfpr6spc,this was amazing and the commentary was beautiful truly a timeless classic
VxoXfpr6spc,i love how he just casually enters a nether fortress not even surprised
VxoXfpr6spc,i appreciate the amount of dedication and effort that you put into this video man respect
VxoXfpr6spc,fun fact in bedrock edition its really common to find strongholds under villages
VxoXfpr6spc,a good tip for your next speedrun at bedrock is that if you just run without jumping you will never lose hunger bars
VxoXfpr6spc,i love how he makes the speedrun feel so alive
VxoXfpr6spc,watching a java player play bedrock is the most annoyance ive had in my life
VxoXfpr6spc,the lesson we learned today never mess with bedrock edition bosses
VxoXfpr6spc,this is a great speedrun thanks for teaching how to speedrun edu edition
VxoXfpr6spc,bro your storytelling skills are on point  defo made the run hella motivational
VxoXfpr6spc,this was a perfect minecraft video the best narration i have ever witnessed
VxoXfpr6spc,i just love how he went attached to simple stuff
VxoXfpr6spc,to what i have experienced i think strongholds in bedrock edition have a small chance to not generate with portal rooms
VxoXfpr6spc,imagine teaching a class then near the end of class you see timmy has gained the achievement free the end
VxoXfpr6spc,the portal mightve been hidden i have found them in education edition so i wouldnt jump in to conclusionsonce i had to search for one for like 3 hours though
VxoXfpr6spc,i love how he slowly realises that edu is just bedrock edition
VxoXfpr6spc,that was the most cinematic speed run ever
VxoXfpr6spc,i legit did this same exact thing with the tnt when i tried to speedrun on adu edition but i ended up finding the portal
VxoXfpr6spc,i felt like this was a movie probably the best minecraft video i watched tysm for this stuff i appriciate it
VxoXfpr6spc,i just imagined a class playing education edition of minecraft but there is one kid that just beats the game while the class finally find diamonds
VxoXfpr6spc,imagine youre trying to teach your students about chemistry and one of them pulls up wearing  the dragons head
VxoXfpr6spc,i once found a stronghold with no portal too in bedrock edition i even used xray glitches and still found nothing i think it might be a glitch in bedrock
VxoXfpr6spc,you are the one person ive ever seen who has switched from java to bedrock and actually suffered the same way i did
VxoXfpr6spc,dude you did an amazing job almost cried when you kept dieing and doubting yourself but i knew you could do it
VxoXfpr6spc,just imagine being in a classdedicated server and getting the free the end achievement while the teacher is explaining how to code
VxoXfpr6spc,in bedrock edition the stronghold basically always spawns under a village
VxoXfpr6spc,dude that is some amazing story telling and script writing you made a storyline to a speedrun well done
VxoXfpr6spc,bedrock edition bosses and education since its based off of bedrock are actually harder and have more health weirdly enough bedrock is supposed to be the more user friendly edition
VxoXfpr6spc,i love how hes telling it like a story that you would tell your grandchildren
VxoXfpr6spc,man your storytelling voice is so good like when you were telling it like a tale of old
VxoXfpr6spc,theres something very calming about this video good stuff
VxoXfpr6spc,one of the greatest speed runs i have ever seen
VxoXfpr6spc,ide love to see this man write a novel
VxoXfpr6spc,i love the way this man just narrated the whole video
VxoXfpr6spc,guys whered jimmy go
VxoXfpr6spc,i like it how the version that can be played on phones means its harder to control the player has a harder boss
VxoXfpr6spc,fun fact some strongholds in bedrock edition education edition dont have an ender portal
VxoXfpr6spc,this sounds more like a sad life story than a speed run lol
VxoXfpr6spc,the thing you did at the last like pacing villagers beds and protecting them that showed your kindness u earned a sub
VxoXfpr6spc,imagine your teacher is waiting for the kids to join and youre already in the end destroying the dragon
VxoXfpr6spc,i played this before if you go into easy mode it will have no mobs at night still blazes and enderman but it makes the dragon pretty easy to fight
VxoXfpr6spc,what wholesome end i never thought id cry today but here we are
VxoXfpr6spc,is it just me or do strongholds always spawn in a village
VxoXfpr6spc,a fact for bedrock and education most stronghold is usually are under villagesalso in those versions dot always spawn
VxoXfpr6spc,dragon doing moves ive never seen before
VxoXfpr6spc,in bedrock edition its very common not to find a end portal in strongholds it happened to me a lot of times
VxoXfpr6spc,the end portal thing happened to me too it happened cuz a ravine destroyed the room where end portal was supposed to be
VxoXfpr6spc,i love how halfway through he goes fck it goes into creative blows up the cave makes an end portal and then goes back to the game
VxoXfpr6spc,btw the new attack that levitates you is dragons breath its more broken in older bedrock versions
VxoXfpr6spc,never give up
VxoXfpr6spc,ive played minecraft education edition before i can confirm that there actually is a end portal in strongbolds
VxoXfpr6spc,now you see what us bedrockers go through honestlybedrock has an extremely tough wither and ender dragon
VxoXfpr6spc,this is not just a speedrun this was a whole entire netflix series
VxoXfpr6spc,this isnt just a speedrun
VxoXfpr6spc,i knew this was going to be kinda frustrating but in the end no pun intended you pulled through
VxoXfpr6spc,the ending was good no one expected this type of good content others dont protect village and he protect and left the dragon egg there humans still alive
VxoXfpr6spc,this video was so dramatic i loved it definitely subscribing
VxoXfpr6spc,also the dragon can clip underground to kill you in tunnels in bedrock too lol java has it easy

j8TcR4ihSyE,as a chelsea fan huge respect to ronaldo for the way he conducted this interview hes easily a living legend
j8TcR4ihSyE,honest confident but still humble and able to reflect his actions after all those years and achievements amazing interview
j8TcR4ihSyE,he is 37 years old this year and still competing at the highest level this is mentality
j8TcR4ihSyE,the mentality that is leading united to 7th place respect 
j8TcR4ihSyE,he is 6th exactly
j8TcR4ihSyE,this guys mentality is something else he is the definition of a winner he is my role model and i am not even a footballer
j8TcR4ihSyE,i dont care what anyone says but this is the mentality you need in all aspects of life thats why this man has done what he has
j8TcR4ihSyE,the mentality ronaldo has is just impecable and it shows through his personal ethics and the game itself incredible
j8TcR4ihSyE,unfortunately looks like utd will finish 6th7th
j8TcR4ihSyE,thats a proper captain and leader his mentality is unmatched in football
j8TcR4ihSyE,this aged well
j8TcR4ihSyE,took manyoo from 2nd to 6th
j8TcR4ihSyE,this really aged well
j8TcR4ihSyE,well how time flies
j8TcR4ihSyE,6th place isnt that bad
j8TcR4ihSyE,what a goat mission completed thx ronaldo
j8TcR4ihSyE,lol this interview aged well he hoped to win 2 trophies
j8TcR4ihSyE,if your not at manchester united to compete for 6th  7th what are you there for because you 6th now lol
j8TcR4ihSyE,im not at man united to compete for 6th or 7th man united finished in 6th this year
j8TcR4ihSyE,his best answer in the interview was
j8TcR4ihSyE,basically cr7 s saying giving advice some of my young team mates feels like trying to teach my 6 year old kids
j8TcR4ihSyE,and four months later manchester united finished 6th
j8TcR4ihSyE, the guys who give up are the guys who are weak mentally  very well said
j8TcR4ihSyE,whos here after united at 7th placed
j8TcR4ihSyE,someone who actually cares about the club unlike half of the current squad respect
j8TcR4ihSyE,he needs to be the captain he elevates the team
j8TcR4ihSyE,and they finsihed 6th
j8TcR4ihSyE,hes 100 right finishing 7th is not acceptable for united
j8TcR4ihSyE,legend of the club his contribution since his arrival and his passion for the club in this interview speaks for itself
j8TcR4ihSyE,fantastic mentality i had my doubts but after this interview its clear that cr7 is not the problem in fact he is a big help on and off the pitch
j8TcR4ihSyE,running out of words to describe this man a true legend
j8TcR4ihSyE,this aged like milk
j8TcR4ihSyE,my guy elite mentality united through and through
j8TcR4ihSyE,by far the best interview i ever watched king of football and king of positive mentality elite footballer
j8TcR4ihSyE,a legend and true professional one of the all time greatest in the game incredible athlete and footballer respect
j8TcR4ihSyE,one of the legends of the game respect him very much hes been on the best level of this sport for years
j8TcR4ihSyE,cristiano ronaldo best
j8TcR4ihSyE,ronaldo fascinates me these interviews show why hes special and the goat younger generations take note this is a winner through and through
j8TcR4ihSyE,mentality of a player and a manager what a great man
j8TcR4ihSyE,you finished 6th so what a shame
j8TcR4ihSyE,sometimes you have to destroy a few things to build good things hes coming for all the weak minded players
j8TcR4ihSyE,i love this man legend not only at united but of the game
j8TcR4ihSyE,this aged very well
j8TcR4ihSyE,i respect this guy much much more after this amazing interviewmind blowingladies and gentlemen this is how winning mentality look like
j8TcR4ihSyE,although im a city fan but i am feeling sad for ronaldo i always saw him competing for the title never saw him sad he was always energetic
j8TcR4ihSyE,the title aged like milk
j8TcR4ihSyE,there will never be any ace player like him from the past or present 
j8TcR4ihSyE,hope things change for the better or as he said its gonna be a nightmare
j8TcR4ihSyE,a winning mentality thats what the whole club need not just ronaldo
j8TcR4ihSyE,he is the greatest of all time a legend of manchester united and an inspiration to millions of people
j8TcR4ihSyE,man the more i watch the interviews of ronaldo the more i can tell how magnetic he is even through a screen i just enjoy listening to someone so legendary
j8TcR4ihSyE,in the premier league even the small clubs look like a big club when they play big teams
j8TcR4ihSyE,sometimes when you be a lil bit harder they do the opposite thats soooo true man
j8TcR4ihSyE,and what is the result they finished 6th
j8TcR4ihSyE,this man is god
j8TcR4ihSyE,well unfortunately this aged not so well
j8TcR4ihSyE,manchester uniteds biggest problem is rewarding average players with world class wages
j8TcR4ihSyE,the best answer in the interview was when the legend said the system is useful if the mentality is not there in the pitch and consistency the goat
j8TcR4ihSyE,penaldo did u see the points table after week 38
j8TcR4ihSyE,tears they finished 6th
j8TcR4ihSyE,penaldo mudded
j8TcR4ihSyE,so glad he came back to the prem now were getting all the english interviews with him huge respect for his mentality and work ethics
j8TcR4ihSyE,a great man and an even greater footballerlong live cr7
MtxqrHiP2Mk,when street food is more expensive than in a restaurant you know youre in america
MtxqrHiP2Mk,the greatest form of torture is to watch sonny review food while youre hungry
MtxqrHiP2Mk,sonny ayo i need to spend 100
MtxqrHiP2Mk,im actually so impressed with how much he was able to buy for 100
MtxqrHiP2Mk,starting off with the spiciest food you could find was a risky play
MtxqrHiP2Mk,so proud of original hockey moms brownies getting recognized theyre the bomb and such an amazing family run place if anyone goes to minnesota its a must try
MtxqrHiP2Mk,me as an american when he says hes going to try to spend 100 at food trucks ok so youre going to like 2 or 3 trucks cool
MtxqrHiP2Mk,when its difficult to want food your videos genuinely help
MtxqrHiP2Mk,everything he ate looked like a raging heart attack i love it
MtxqrHiP2Mk,you can literally buy almost everything in indonesias street food with 100
MtxqrHiP2Mk,sonnys gonna have to get used to spending a whole lot more money on food now that hes back home this us adventure is starting off great
MtxqrHiP2Mk,thats the thing with food trucks in the us everything is super overpriced so hitting 100 dollars mark isnt a problem
MtxqrHiP2Mk,but now theyre finally coming together here in my mouth i felt that
MtxqrHiP2Mk,as a mexican its hard to imagine burning the rice on purpose
MtxqrHiP2Mk,decision to move to states to film because of lockdown in vietnam has proven to be success great job sonny
MtxqrHiP2Mk,korean and mexico finally coming together in my mouth
MtxqrHiP2Mk,the worst part of all your shows is the fact i have to wait for the next episode
MtxqrHiP2Mk,im so stoked on this new american chapter asia was rad and this feels like the perfect time to change continents looking forward to it
MtxqrHiP2Mk,that food truck fest looks fun so glad u shared your experience with us sonny
MtxqrHiP2Mk,yum as an canadian you made me very jealous with all that delicious food
MtxqrHiP2Mk,as delicious as the food may look the asian in me finds it really jarring that you managed to spend the 100 for once
MtxqrHiP2Mk,yes love these kind of videos from you seeing the difference in food prices from across the globe
MtxqrHiP2Mk,cool to see sonny has brought his talents to merica 
MtxqrHiP2Mk,what an absolute dream job well deserved you have worked your tail off to get where you are totally love the great content

kaePaSZWGgk,that camera man deserves a bonus for capturing all of that figueirdos face was absolutely hilarious
kaePaSZWGgk,i love how the call out looked like it was straight out the office the pan from sean to henry with figuriedo beffudled in the middle was insane
kaePaSZWGgk,henry came up and everyone was like wtf is he even doing here lmao security treated him like an obnoxious fan
kaePaSZWGgk,the henry bit was comedy gold
kaePaSZWGgk,my favorite part was figgys reaction
kaePaSZWGgk,that sequence with cejudo and figgys reaction was so good i thought it was a skit for a sec
kaePaSZWGgk,adesayna walked out to undertakers intro and somehow henry still took the wwe performance of the night
kaePaSZWGgk,henry is hilarious lmao sean was left speechless
kaePaSZWGgk,he was surprisingly humble and sounds like a nice guy
kaePaSZWGgk,triple c was hilarious thats probably my favorite mma interview whaddya say precious
kaePaSZWGgk,get that little person out of here
kaePaSZWGgk,henry was hilarious
kaePaSZWGgk,the zoom in on figgy was as if its an episode of the office
kaePaSZWGgk,sean looked like he was going to cry after henry walked away
kaePaSZWGgk,sean nailed it with the description of cejudo he tries to hard
kaePaSZWGgk,cejudo making everyone cringe but the security taking him away is just amazing
kaePaSZWGgk,man i love sean but i havent seen him that scared in a while haha
kaePaSZWGgk,confirmed omalley will be going up to heavyweight to fight henry cejudo
kaePaSZWGgk,sean wants no part of cejudo did not even have an inkling of agreeing to that fight
kaePaSZWGgk,omalley was shaken lol caught totally offguard and had no response
kaePaSZWGgk,pedro definitely dove for the technical decision that eye poke was the most mild one ive ever seen lost all respect for pedro
kaePaSZWGgk,sean looked shookstartled when he saw henry was listening hahaha
kaePaSZWGgk,as flashy and loud as sean is he always stays pretty humble and hes honest thats why im a suga fan
kaePaSZWGgk,dominating wtf he didnt do anything i dont think he knows the definition of domination
kaePaSZWGgk,pedro could only see black cos he was looking at the inside of his eyelid
kaePaSZWGgk,that was actually hilarious thats called a tune up come fight a team figh
kaePaSZWGgk,love sean but god i love henrys gimic so friggin funny  uriah laughing filming in the background just gold
kaePaSZWGgk,cejudo was only there to challenge everyone backstage and in the crowd
kaePaSZWGgk,figueirdos face was priceless
kaePaSZWGgk,think cejudo called out everyone on that fight card
kaePaSZWGgk,such a polite young lad  his parents must be very proud
kaePaSZWGgk,bro cejudo had me absolutely dying when he interrupted out of no where and said id love a tune up fight
kaePaSZWGgk,henry funny as hell   hey precious
kaePaSZWGgk,when cejudo starting talking this interview immediately turned into an episode of the office
kaePaSZWGgk,that pan to davidson was office levels of funny
kaePaSZWGgk,henry had him
kaePaSZWGgk,prelim pedro didnt even wait the 5 minutes
kaePaSZWGgk,i could use a tune up fight bro i do wanna see henry come back lol
kaePaSZWGgk,such a polite young lad his parents must be very proud
kaePaSZWGgk,omalley is scared
kaePaSZWGgk,cejudo is just embarrassing at this point no wonder the ufc arent interested in him fighting for the belt
kaePaSZWGgk,ccc had sean shook
kaePaSZWGgk,seans a class act honest and brutal
kaePaSZWGgk,sean froze when henry called him out
kaePaSZWGgk,camera man made this look like i was looking at a sitcom
kaePaSZWGgk,once pedro realized that could have been a reason to quit he took it and didnt even think about it automatically took it
kaePaSZWGgk,turns out pedro wasnt faking the eye poke  hes confirmed to have suffered a right corneal abrasion
kaePaSZWGgk,the only thing he was dominating was checking leg kicks
kaePaSZWGgk, get that little person outta here 
kaePaSZWGgk,thats was hilarious uriah faber cracking up on the background
kaePaSZWGgk,cejudo trolled omalley lmao he got flustered by the cringe
kaePaSZWGgk,didnt get hit once lmao
kaePaSZWGgk,this is like a scene from the office
kaePaSZWGgk,cejudo is so cringe lmao
kaePaSZWGgk,i was completely dominating  more like hes completely delusional
kaePaSZWGgk,the cameraman deserves the bonus by zooming in on the god of war and henry to priceless
kaePaSZWGgk,henrys like a character from a key and peele skit
kaePaSZWGgk,figs face
kaePaSZWGgk,this was a literal real life scene of the office
kaePaSZWGgk,henry is trying to fight anyone with a heartbeat
kaePaSZWGgk,all the sean ball huggers comicalhes a legend in his own mindsean would be content fighting tomato cans all his careerlol
kaePaSZWGgk,pedro could see and feel sean was finding his range
kaePaSZWGgk,caroline does the best interviews period end of story awesome work
kaePaSZWGgk,if this fight happens this is going to be a very memorable moment
kaePaSZWGgk,im glad henry called him out
kaePaSZWGgk,im not gonna lie henry had me laughing hella
kaePaSZWGgk,respect for omalley
kaePaSZWGgk,he says nobody takes him seriously
kaePaSZWGgk,ive got to say that pedro bitched out he had a full 5 minutes to recover and barely waited a minute before calling it
kaePaSZWGgk,figgi was probably like phew he didnt call me out lol
kaePaSZWGgk,did henry just go around challenging all the winner of last nights ppv or something first volk and then sean
kaePaSZWGgk,didnt see he was standing there 
kaePaSZWGgk,20 more seconds and he would have had his 2nd loss 109 pedro on 23 judges scorecards in the first round
kaePaSZWGgk,the security was even laughing but cejudo was dead serious but he put it in a joking manner

Vbu7HOCti2c,you dont know how happy watching this makes me
U5LMHGfL39M,its so hard to believe that a president of the united states would allow this at our border
U5LMHGfL39M,her saying find a solution tells me she knows the border is a problem and that shes not doing anything about it intentionally
U5LMHGfL39M,the current executive branch should be held accountable for all of these crimes against the people of the usa
U5LMHGfL39M,shes just upset that hes doing a better job being the border czar than she is hell anybody could do a better job than she is
U5LMHGfL39M,i thank gov abbott for his action deploying national guards to stop illegal immigrants crossing the border
U5LMHGfL39M,this border czar hasnt done jack for us here in tx besides make things worse abbott is the only one trying to fix this and force mxico to help
U5LMHGfL39M,harris calling anyone a socalled leader  is mind blowing
U5LMHGfL39M,if she would have done her job shes such a embarrassment im disgusted with this administration
U5LMHGfL39M,we had a solution till biden became president lets keep that narrative alive and not act like that this is something new
U5LMHGfL39M,send them back stop bringing them over and paying them when we have our own issues to deal with
U5LMHGfL39M,abbott is doing the right thing the same tjhing the feds should have been doing all along shut the southern border down no crossers
U5LMHGfL39M,as a texan i appreciate our governor and his efforts to deal with this problem the federal government hasnt done anything to assist with the border issue
U5LMHGfL39M,kackala using the term socalled leaders is just fully packed with irony
U5LMHGfL39M,shes talking about herself and jb
U5LMHGfL39M,thank you governor abbott for being a fantastic leader
U5LMHGfL39M,whats kamalas solution
U5LMHGfL39M,abbott defensive stand is long overdue but very much appreciated
U5LMHGfL39M,harris should repeat that line while standing in front of a mirror
U5LMHGfL39M,so called leaders focus on solutions obviously she is referring to herself
U5LMHGfL39M,we need more politicians like general abbott  god bless you and god bless the great state of texas
U5LMHGfL39M,when government takes away citizens right to bear arms it becomes the citizens duty to take away government rights to govern
U5LMHGfL39M,hold your ground mr abbott  respect
U5LMHGfL39M,they want them here we dont keep up the good fight governor abbott
U5LMHGfL39M,come on now the biden administration showed us his solution the day he took office
U5LMHGfL39M,lets all give governor abbott a round of applause  the man is actually doing something instead of just babbling
U5LMHGfL39M,no free man shall ever be debarred the use of arms  thomas jefferson virginia constitution draft 1 1776
U5LMHGfL39M,weve got to take this stuff seriously as seriously as you are because youve been forced to take this seriously
U5LMHGfL39M,i prefer dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery
U5LMHGfL39M,keep protesting those are real insurrection words
U5LMHGfL39M,thank god for gob abbot god bless him
U5LMHGfL39M,kamala telling anyone to focus on solutions is one of the most hilarious things i have heard in my life time  she is the joke heard around the world
U5LMHGfL39M,thank god for real leaders like gov abbott and gov desantis kamala should  heed her own words
U5LMHGfL39M,ok legs up harris time for you to do something even if its wrong you have done nothing at all wake up america  maga
U5LMHGfL39M,god bless gov abbott and everything he sets his hand to  in jesus precious name
U5LMHGfL39M,and what solution would our border czar vp harris who hasnt been doing her job come up with at least someone gov abbott is doing something
U5LMHGfL39M,this is coming from someone that her family used to owned slaves at least abbott is doing something l support him 100
U5LMHGfL39M,biden and kamalas crowd shows up in the 10s
U5LMHGfL39M,her calling abbot a so called leader
U5LMHGfL39M,at least the mans doing your job and taking action she hasnt even been to the border i havent been to europe either giggle repeat the line giggle
U5LMHGfL39M,thank you gov abbott for trying to protect americans
U5LMHGfL39M,our border czar speaks more like border scar someone must have reminded her she still has this title as of this writing she has already forgotten this
U5LMHGfL39M,so call leaders immediately biden and harris comes to mind
U5LMHGfL39M,democrat  we need new gun control laws
U5LMHGfL39M,what is joe biden and kamala harris doing about that
U5LMHGfL39M,what country can preserve its liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance let them take arms
U5LMHGfL39M,supposed leaders amen praise god
U5LMHGfL39M,and what has harris done other than laughing like a dingbat
U5LMHGfL39M,i think we should bring up impeachment charges for both biden and harris for treason for the borders and giving away the oil reserves to other countries
U5LMHGfL39M,socalled leaders  nonleader
U5LMHGfL39M,a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed
U5LMHGfL39M,seems when someone interferes with the hate for mrtitanium you get zoned time to get over their childish behavior bravo governor texas tall
U5LMHGfL39M,ok how the hell is biden going to declare pregnancy a public health emergency
U5LMHGfL39M,at least the governor is trying
U5LMHGfL39M,she knew whats missing with her solution to all non sense coming out from this administration
U5LMHGfL39M,so called leaders take action  that took balls these snakes are unbelievable
U5LMHGfL39M,the constitution is clear
U5LMHGfL39M,thank god he love us those who trust him will be protected by him
U5LMHGfL39M,if they are doing nothing at the borderits equal to aiding and abetting
U5LMHGfL39M,lets go brandon a nation without a secure border is not a nation
U5LMHGfL39M,so called leaders
U5LMHGfL39M,so called leader  now theres something harris knows something about
U5LMHGfL39M,this is so scary
U5LMHGfL39M,thank you gov abbot cause these  so called leaders  in the white house arent doing a thing 
U5LMHGfL39M,only solution harris has where that skunk at
U5LMHGfL39M,i think god has begun to intervenehe is exposing the enemy and people are waking up and choosing truth praise god  thank you jesus
U5LMHGfL39M,this whole administration gives me huge second hand embarrassment
U5LMHGfL39M,you go governor keep up the good work gods speed to you and yours
U5LMHGfL39M,imagine going to trial with kamala harris as your attorney lmaooo
U5LMHGfL39M,kamala couldnt do a simple math solution shed be good a repetitive riddles
U5LMHGfL39M,hmm isnt the federal government responsible for securing the us borders i learned about this topic and american history in high school back in germany many years ago
U5LMHGfL39M,joe said hed stop the reversal of roe vs wade yep he said that after falling off his treacherous bike  walloping his noggin
U5LMHGfL39M,im proud to wear my ultra maga badge all the time with pride
U5LMHGfL39M,i guess harris must still be looking for the root cause of the problem
U5LMHGfL39M,he came up with a solution he sent them back just what our glorious leader should be doing fjb
U5LMHGfL39M,if the governor of texas is telling you theres a problem why would you act like there isnt the government should be helping not making things worse
U5LMHGfL39M,if the fed doesnt want to do something about the border then the states have to do  something
U5LMHGfL39M,i have always had respect for anyone who could work there way to that position but im just not sure what is going on right now
U5LMHGfL39M,as joe sead
U5LMHGfL39M,until someone in washington does something anything i believe the states should do whatever is necessary

ucAWhiiFjLA,canada ranks 31st of 32 countries for debt as a percentage of gdp
ucAWhiiFjLA,front loading should have happened months ago when maklin claimed inflation was transitory   the boc is reactionary and playing catchup
ucAWhiiFjLA,should do more segments like this  id like to see how the maritime provinces are also doing
ucAWhiiFjLA,thanks jt for getting our taxpayer funded news to tell us the peasants are going down hard
ucAWhiiFjLA,what does it mean little people get screwed rinse and repeat
ucAWhiiFjLA,cut government spending and booms inflation slows mind blown
ucAWhiiFjLA,its not covids fault its government overreaction to covid thats the problem
ucAWhiiFjLA,100 basis points or 1 for normal people still not really much different than prepandemic levels but somehow this is news
ucAWhiiFjLA,how boc can bring down inflation  you look back in march 2020 boc said go borrow more money and spending more as interest rate is low  lol
ucAWhiiFjLA,hopefully people will remember this is a large problem caused by liberals at vote time and this government will start to destroy canadian farmers
ucAWhiiFjLA,instead of making laws that prohibit price gouging and senseless greed lets just make the poor poorer instead this should fix everything
ucAWhiiFjLA,id like to know how the federal deficit is doing with all that debt
ucAWhiiFjLA,whao she makes me laugh  government generously  jajaja she is really well paid to said that
ucAWhiiFjLA,buy a house buy an ev not to good for us not rich folks i know many folks who will loose their house over this good work
ucAWhiiFjLA,the inflation wont go down  the interest hike wont work  job market is tight because more people quit looking for jobs and live on printed money
ucAWhiiFjLA,hmm printing money creates inflation eh
ucAWhiiFjLA,are we facing inflation because the usa printed trillions of dollars
ucAWhiiFjLA,this woman is so wrong about mortgage holders pretty much painting them all with one brush
ucAWhiiFjLA,maybe they shouldnt have printed so much money   all fiat currencies go to zero and the canadian dollar will be no different
ucAWhiiFjLA,we have to do protest government  making us beggers
ucAWhiiFjLA,25 percent we need 78 to counter inflation lol we are still in a stimulus economy
ucAWhiiFjLA,the bank of canada waited too long to raise rates now they are playing catch up and the consumers are suffering do they know whats going on
ucAWhiiFjLA,rich bcoming more rich and poor poorer dats inflation
ucAWhiiFjLA,pm pierre warned you but you were ignorant to listen its justinflation
ucAWhiiFjLA,how does that work spending less full employment cool the economy cost of rental and cost of food this segment has me so depressed 2 years for better inflation
ucAWhiiFjLA,if third time announce by our bank governor i am for sure to get my money out 
ucAWhiiFjLA,and what do you care about canadians tell me of any canadian bank that actually cares about its actual depositors other than they have your money to play with
ucAWhiiFjLA,means i can finally raise my rates 35  i winlets do it again 
ucAWhiiFjLA,medias mind conditioning
ucAWhiiFjLA,so they are saying not to get a mortgage and to keep renting so vague its doom but not yet
ucAWhiiFjLA,hopefully lower inflation
ucAWhiiFjLA,what goes down must go up
ucAWhiiFjLA,canada was in party mode 2010 to 2018 thanks to boc rate policies
ucAWhiiFjLA,money printing
ucAWhiiFjLA,what get people to spend less while everything is more expensive
ucAWhiiFjLA,unbelievable welcome to the next 2009
ucAWhiiFjLA,fomo home buyers have left the chat
ucAWhiiFjLA,money printer goes brrrrrrr
ucAWhiiFjLA,it means poor people suffer more
ucAWhiiFjLA,he has to go
ucAWhiiFjLA,cant wait to move out of this country
ucAWhiiFjLA,what the interest rate hike means for you that youre screwed lol
ucAWhiiFjLA,that is a heck of a record collection shes got behind her
ucAWhiiFjLA,crushed on both sides is good for you really
ucAWhiiFjLA,still way to low
ucAWhiiFjLA,get peter schiff on already
ucAWhiiFjLA,you get what you vote for pierre for pn
ucAWhiiFjLA,oh its only 30 of people who have a mortgage she is obviously not one of them or she would not have that smug look on her face
ucAWhiiFjLA,what is she smoking she didnt even make one point except regurgitate speculation
ucAWhiiFjLA,you know you just dont care
ucAWhiiFjLA,whats on all those albums

7-5uaPPCjBE,these clowns keep up mess like this then they turn around and act like they dont know why we dont trust them
7-5uaPPCjBE,if you vote for the other guy then you aint a breakfast taco  dr jill biden
7-5uaPPCjBE,key word may have thats not an evidence
7-5uaPPCjBE,evidence is a strong word for whats going on in congress these days
7-5uaPPCjBE,wake me up when ray epps and john sullivan are called to testify
7-5uaPPCjBE,how can you confirm what a call was about if you dont take the call
7-5uaPPCjBE,that crazy meeting in the white house is hilarious cippolone after seeing the overstock ceo missed the opportunity to ask bozo what you couldnt find the shamwow guy
7-5uaPPCjBE,evidence  as a conservative i feel like its the year 1600 and were the witches
7-5uaPPCjBE,imagine that the person in charge of capitol security that rejected the national guard that day and cherry picked the committee investigating the event wants to focus on trumpshocker
7-5uaPPCjBE,i love how theyre still pretending anyone believes them helloooo do you not read your own comments section
7-5uaPPCjBE,jan 6th is the worst day that ever happened even worse than when i was misgendered at the mall
7-5uaPPCjBE,thank you brandon for the current prices of food gasoline  everything else not to mention the border crisis and sending strategic us oil reserves to china
7-5uaPPCjBE,there isnt a single dissenting voice on the jan 6th committee everyone shares the same view even before they started this shame this is what fascists do in investigations
7-5uaPPCjBE,if they had something theyd prosecute they got nothing this is about preventing him from running again
7-5uaPPCjBE,what we care about is why groceries prices continue to climb as well as high gas prices
7-5uaPPCjBE,what a headline i thought it was focused on something else im glad they cleared that up
7-5uaPPCjBE,i thought theyve been focused on trump since 2015
7-5uaPPCjBE,i like how pat cipollone said thats not how we do things in the united states
7-5uaPPCjBE,hahaha they went from trump organized an armed insurrection with the help of his immediate circle
7-5uaPPCjBE,if no one is arrested after all these investigations and these hearings then the j6 committee should be punished for wasting everyones time and taxpayers money on a nothing burger
7-5uaPPCjBE,trump must be really awesome to spend millions of our tax dollars trying to depose him mueller investigation impeachments now this farce its dems doing insurrection
7-5uaPPCjBE,to know that theyre still with this jan 6th hoax is infuriating our government is a complete joke
7-5uaPPCjBE,famous liberal quotes
7-5uaPPCjBE,hey joehowd it go begging saudi arabia for oil
7-5uaPPCjBE,just to be sure the security at the capitol that day is gonna be or has been questioned too right
7-5uaPPCjBE,evidence but no evidence in sight lmfaoo
7-5uaPPCjBE,so the main question i see here  why is this committee spending so much time and effort to blame trump  they are afraid of him
7-5uaPPCjBE,its the economy stupid  the official inflation rate is now 91a new 40year high  it was 14 when trump left office
7-5uaPPCjBE,about as good as the evidence that amber heard brought to the table
7-5uaPPCjBE,uhhh youll heard about the evidence against  hunter and joe theyre literal traitors
7-5uaPPCjBE,evidence is not a living thing so it can not focus
7-5uaPPCjBE,how does evidence focus on anything if i wanted to be bombarded with strange theories that are tangentially associated with questionable evidence id be watching alex jones
7-5uaPPCjBE,we should focus on biden and our economy
7-5uaPPCjBE,no evidence of widespread insurrection of january 6th
7-5uaPPCjBE,saying something will be wild means absolutely nothing
7-5uaPPCjBE,these people are insane trump is still haunting their dreams
7-5uaPPCjBE,bravo sri lanka  for calling your misleaders out and chasing those bastards out we are with you
7-5uaPPCjBE,was there a trial for those who were destroying cities for months
7-5uaPPCjBE,oh they referred it to the justice dept im sure theyll do the right thing thank god were in good hands
7-5uaPPCjBE,this  january 6 committee is such bs hey congress lets get something done to help inflation
7-5uaPPCjBE,bombshell the jan 6 investigation into trump focuses on trump  damn i never would have guessed
7-5uaPPCjBE,thanks for continuing to popularize trump
7-5uaPPCjBE,lets see the phone and email records of pelosi  now that would be interesting
7-5uaPPCjBE,they have to look like theyre working for the greater good  a  dog stops digging when its lost the scent
7-5uaPPCjBE,even with disklikes turned off i know abc is being ratiod to hell lmao
7-5uaPPCjBE,they are running scared because their time is up  god is turning the tables on them
7-5uaPPCjBE,91 inflation highest since  1981 under democrat jimmy carter
7-5uaPPCjBE,i like how they leave out the part where trump told them to go peacfully 
7-5uaPPCjBE,the only insurrection in history where people were let into the building and walked calmly in between velvet foot traffic ropes
7-5uaPPCjBE,those midterms cant get here fast enough
7-5uaPPCjBE,abc ratings going down as fast as liz
7-5uaPPCjBE,breakfast tacos for trump
7-5uaPPCjBE,if you dont vote for joe then you aint a breakfast taco
7-5uaPPCjBE,the legal advice of the truth religious lee defined burger court
7-5uaPPCjBE,all these trumplings are going to lose whats left of their addled minds when reality hits their warped view of this story
7-5uaPPCjBE,btw if youre ever not sure what the right decision is just do the opposite of a cheney
7-5uaPPCjBE,ive seen a lot of innuendos havent seen any evidence yet
7-5uaPPCjBE,clown show of 2022
7-5uaPPCjBE,bidens doing a great job isnt he
7-5uaPPCjBE,722  sir lanka burns down their capitol in a real insurrection to start a new govt
7-5uaPPCjBE,thankfully there is only one more of these leftist democratrino pony shows left then the house can get back to matters that might actually be important
7-5uaPPCjBE,oh no couldnt of ray went down the day before when are we going to hear from him us citizens want to know
7-5uaPPCjBE,what a waste of time and money
7-5uaPPCjBE,we put tacos in the back of a truck to cook in the sun
7-5uaPPCjBE,breaking news january 6th investigation is about trump i had no idea
7-5uaPPCjBE,we literally pay the
7-5uaPPCjBE,lock him up hes a cruel sociopath
7-5uaPPCjBE,imagine if these dems focused as much on real issues as they do with trump
7-5uaPPCjBE,hasnt he always been the focus
7-5uaPPCjBE,one missed call from trump
7-5uaPPCjBE,when is pelosi  going to
7-5uaPPCjBE,some would call the humane society for beating the dead horse called 16
7-5uaPPCjBE,evidence thats hilarious what evidencesomeone told me he said something to the effect of is far from evidence
7-5uaPPCjBE,im disgusted that they blame trump who didnt incite violence yet maxine waters has multiple times
7-5uaPPCjBE,ive noticed that abc puts trumps picture on and they get clicks thats what this is really about theyre screaming please notice me
7-5uaPPCjBE,this time dat mean ol drumpfh will go to jail for sure  itll happen this time  our democracy is at steak
7-5uaPPCjBE,shout out to george floyd on 2 years of sobriety it took some tough love but he did it say his name liberals
7-5uaPPCjBE,this has been a very poor first season
7-5uaPPCjBE,wait i thought this was focusing on him the entire time no one cares

qrmW96pkc_I,odessans still have the genuine smiles  despite the odds theyre facing knowing their sacrifices are for their country ukranians just have that amazing spirit of nationalism mabuhay kayo
qrmW96pkc_I,godbless ukraine peace
qrmW96pkc_I,the germans were pardon methe russians that was a satisfying gaffe
qrmW96pkc_I,russias strategic goals were to make sweden and finland joining nato uniting the western allinace and cutting the economical and political ties with the western european countries bravo vova
qrmW96pkc_I,russias plans are specifically defined as follows
qrmW96pkc_I,the maps presented are very useful thanks
qrmW96pkc_I,pushing forward in the north and the south that is one way of describing a massive retreat i suppose
qrmW96pkc_I,germany should provide ukraine with more such artillery
qrmW96pkc_I,if russia says something is true then you know that it is false
qrmW96pkc_I,it would be hugely humiliating for the russian army in luhansk to be destroyed by 4 himars
qrmW96pkc_I,evade being caught in the cauldron the germans every ww2 buff the who
qrmW96pkc_I,ukrainian soldiers are fighting for their sovereignty country ukrainenot like russia aggressors
qrmW96pkc_I,the real issue is its not war if it was you would see complete anhilation of civilians and army
qrmW96pkc_I,and they managed to evade to be caught in the cauldron that the germans  pardon me  russians were talking about d
qrmW96pkc_I,if zelensky is so bold why havent he used his western supplied precision weapons to strike targets inside russias border
qrmW96pkc_I,ukraine wasnt granted the privilege to use the systems long range capability 450km range is blatantly false information the rocket systems  given to ukraine are limited
qrmW96pkc_I,its a shame they cant counterattack now when the russian side wants to take a break
qrmW96pkc_I,i love how everyone in the comments is suddenly a military expert
qrmW96pkc_I,what are russias strategic goals
qrmW96pkc_I,thank you to all western countries support ukraine fully on weapons and humanity services 
qrmW96pkc_I,after these atrocities are ended and the ukrainian citizens can get back to leading normal peaceful lives within their hopefully unchanged  borders ill start planning a vacation to odessa
qrmW96pkc_I,the west is far to slow supplying modern weapons 
qrmW96pkc_I,zelenskyy means to say finally american weapons are helping
qrmW96pkc_I,thank you to dw news for their continued fabulous coverage of whats happening in ukraine
qrmW96pkc_I,thank you lord  please continue to defend ukraine  they are weary and tired with the constant bombardment by the bully russians praying for you always ukraine 
qrmW96pkc_I,yes those new weapons are making a difference on the battlefield
qrmW96pkc_I,i say get them trained on the f35 lightening ii then casually hand over ten of them same with abrams and apache
qrmW96pkc_I,why is every correspondent on here always in kiev or lviv always talking about what is going on in donbas but never actually making statements from donbas
qrmW96pkc_I,war in ukraine  is another great channel with daily map and strategic discussion
qrmW96pkc_I,the germansuhh i mean the russians
qrmW96pkc_I,says alot ukraine  standing and fighting
qrmW96pkc_I,why putin not come to his senses and allow both russian and ukrainian people to live in peace and prosper
qrmW96pkc_I,goals are the same death and destruction
qrmW96pkc_I,well done dorks youre inheriting rubble
qrmW96pkc_I,funny thing is that i remember putin saying that his special operation would be over in a few days and that was back in february  glory to ukraine
qrmW96pkc_I,i wish germany was really helping ukraine with the heavy weapons
qrmW96pkc_I,i thought they stated their strategic goals these guys are funny
qrmW96pkc_I,they will be able to come home hopefully soonand hopefully not in the same shape as the cities in the donbas
qrmW96pkc_I,this war has shaken the whole world
qrmW96pkc_I,russia thought they had the second best military in the world and found out they have the second best military in ukraine  d
qrmW96pkc_I,yep red dawn wolverine pukins ars stay strong ukraine viking prayer sometimes you have to take one step back to take two steps forward
qrmW96pkc_I,strategy foreign concept to russiaobviously
qrmW96pkc_I,russias tactical operational and strategic goals is fundamentally special operations
qrmW96pkc_I,they are talking about emergency soon they will have no sea thanks to russia
qrmW96pkc_I,regrettably history shows russia is too big not to grind out a victory regardless of incompetence and corruption without very stiff resistance
qrmW96pkc_I,special military operations means taking control of flagship areas by rookie troops those who makes it after the war will be rewarded accordingly
qrmW96pkc_I,god help ukraine
qrmW96pkc_I,those weapons will continue to make a difference as the numbers and more accurate munitions are delivered by the west
qrmW96pkc_I,slava ukraini
qrmW96pkc_I,friends volunteers from europe and the usa   ukraine need your help in donbass we fight for all europe  thank you
qrmW96pkc_I,godbless ukraine  peace
qrmW96pkc_I,this reminds me of the soviet propogands during the early days of world war ii huge ukranian victory with huge russian losses followed by a glorious retreat
qrmW96pkc_I,give ukraine all the weapons they want its not like they are asking for boots on the ground
qrmW96pkc_I,from dw saying russian will run out of ammo fuel and food russia is losing to what is russias strategic goals what a world are we living in
qrmW96pkc_I,the russians can easily bombard the minefields and that is what they might do
qrmW96pkc_I,look   it doesnt matter what goals  russia has   there is a goal keeper   preventing the goals
qrmW96pkc_I,now that boris johnson has resigned who knows whether the next pm of uk will support ukraine as he did 
qrmW96pkc_I,thank you always for the daily updates denys
qrmW96pkc_I,these military expert comments are full of suppositionsare there real facts available what is the point of commenting if there are no facts made available
qrmW96pkc_I,i would like to see an ongoing report of western weapons arriving and being used by ukraine
qrmW96pkc_I,germans  excuse me russians 
qrmW96pkc_I,we have seen that british democracy requires the prime minister to step down we call on the russian people to vote on whether putin step down
qrmW96pkc_I,keep the longrange missiles systems flowing with 100 of those systems ukraine can actually start taking their land back snake island is a perfect example
qrmW96pkc_I,ruzzians keep in dark not only the world but also ruzzian citizens are kept in dark nobody ever told them what the goals are
qrmW96pkc_I,putin comes back from the afterlife and goes to a bar in moscow he is
qrmW96pkc_I,instead of going to the beach you people should be working at a munitions factory working for your independence not whining about the beach being closed
qrmW96pkc_I,heaven will take action against unjust
qrmW96pkc_I,ukranian artillery is very precise  indeed  it targets civilians right where its intended  bravo zelenski
qrmW96pkc_I,from putin to his soldiers remember stalingrad remember leningrad remember moscow during world war 2 his battle cry k
qrmW96pkc_I,let him praise what ever he likes or not
qrmW96pkc_I,does anyone remember that time when two democracies went to war   because i dont     thats two democracies where most of the society can vote  not just privileged few
qrmW96pkc_I,tactical retreat
qrmW96pkc_I,chechenya is the strategic goal of russia in ukraine
qrmW96pkc_I,i hope western satellite intellegence can accurately locate russian artillary in real time

fcY8YHw_sBc,im so excited for him
fcY8YHw_sBc,i feel like 55million is a bit of a bargaina player like raphina definitely worth like at least 70million
fcY8YHw_sBc,i thought he already signed for tottenham spurs
fcY8YHw_sBc,barcelona for life welcome to the camp raphinha
fcY8YHw_sBc,best of luck rapha thanks for some great memories and tg he didnt go to chelsea bring on the new season
fcY8YHw_sBc,chelsea fans laugh at arsenal only to end up like arsenal
fcY8YHw_sBc,glad to see it probably finally done  but still cant help feel were being dudded
fcY8YHw_sBc,god knows how they can afford him when they owe players millions in wages
fcY8YHw_sBc,surprised no pl teams upped their offers for this player what a miss he will be in the pl slightly disappointed
fcY8YHw_sBc,welcome to the best club in the world welcome raphinha vis br
fcY8YHw_sBc,barca is pretending to be in debt
fcY8YHw_sBc,take him deal baller up the chels
fcY8YHw_sBc,chelsea and arsenal never really had a chance once barca came in barca and real madrid have the pull
fcY8YHw_sBc,leeds are doing business with barcelona
fcY8YHw_sBc,after getting this money leeds will now buy two players to replace him like cody gakpo or adama traore
fcY8YHw_sBc,but chelsea fans said they signed him last week what has happened
fcY8YHw_sBc,after this transfer window
fcY8YHw_sBc,they have the money to purchase player but did not payback the money to frenkie but frenkie wants to continue barca will not paycut to stay
fcY8YHw_sBc,and they are going to pay for this how
fcY8YHw_sBc,sad   he was the heartbeat of that leeds team  hope we get some good replacements 
fcY8YHw_sBc,luis sinisterra is a decent replacement for him
fcY8YHw_sBc,got him on klarna then paul bohill will turn up from cant pay well take it away then auction them off
fcY8YHw_sBc,barca must have some money coming in from somewhere
fcY8YHw_sBc,barcelona signing so many players in that position lol

fcY8YHw_sBc,what is that car doing xd
fcY8YHw_sBc,it would have been wasteful for chelsea to sign raphinalet him join barcelona
fcY8YHw_sBc,20p a week payment plan
fcY8YHw_sBc,where does the money come from
fcY8YHw_sBc,this is not breaking news we knew this a couple of days ago
fcY8YHw_sBc,would that be money or credit on the never never
fcY8YHw_sBc,chelsea dusted lmao

wMtJPegwL08,imagine a whole force of police being afraid of one person so freakin humiliating these guys are clearly just police to cash a paycheck
wMtJPegwL08,what sickens me the most is out of everything the police department is more worried about finding out who leaked the video just disgusting
wMtJPegwL08,imagine being a kid inside the classroom with the shooter while he starts shooting them and the officers just stay outside
wMtJPegwL08,to protect and serve i feel like the teachers wouldve done more
wMtJPegwL08,whoever leaked the footage is a legend
wMtJPegwL08,i hope those parents sue that police department into oblivion
wMtJPegwL08,they had time to sanitize their hands though stopping the spread of germs is more important than stopping the spread of bullets apparently
wMtJPegwL08,and they choose to harass a courageous mother who ran in to save her kids
wMtJPegwL08,glad the mayor is really putting focus on whats important a leaked video instead of the abysmal police response and total lack accountability theyve faced
wMtJPegwL08,the fact theres a cop more worried about sanitizing his hands shows exactly how spineless the all were
wMtJPegwL08,that phone call was heart breaking
wMtJPegwL08,its as if the one coward was symbolically washing his hands of his duty
wMtJPegwL08,that would be terrifying being a kid and hear gun fire and to learn you have escape death rip to the kids and to the family
wMtJPegwL08,cops when unarmed young adult is on the ground fill him full of lead
wMtJPegwL08,so he wants an investigation about how the footage was leaked but he wont investigate why the cops didnt do their job to at least try and save those kids
wMtJPegwL08,cowarding behind each other putting on hand sanitizer and checking their phone this is completely unacceptable
wMtJPegwL08,if they were so freaking scared then they should have let the parents in
wMtJPegwL08,that guys using the hand sanitizer was his priority wow
wMtJPegwL08,take all of their badges all of them they dont deserve them protect and serve my ass
wMtJPegwL08,cowards  everybody that was in that hallway in the first 20min should be fired   put in front of a firing squad letting them kids get mowed down like that
wMtJPegwL08,whoever was over this raid and was in charge need to be fired asap lord please have mercy on the parents
wMtJPegwL08,the amount of footage ive seen of military and swat systematically clearing buildings and youre telling me these guys dont have the same basic training whats going on
wMtJPegwL08,as soon as i saw that little boy in the hallway i felt ill and then bawled the entire time i dont even like kids and this is heartbreaking
wMtJPegwL08,thank you the world needs to see and hear what really happened to those little kids may they all rip
wMtJPegwL08,they stood there idly by and listened to those babies get slaughtered  they deserve their scorn
wMtJPegwL08,they stood there forever they told them to stand back the actual video is an hour and 25 minutes long
wMtJPegwL08,law enforcement oath of honor
wMtJPegwL08,these cops really let those kids down this video must tear those parents apart inside
wMtJPegwL08,i did not know the shooter had initially crashed his car and that spectators had rushed to help him only to get fired upon
wMtJPegwL08,i see the title of this and though im drawn to the story because of what happened in uvalde i know that my heart cannot take watching this
wMtJPegwL08,my heart is breaking for those children i cant understand
wMtJPegwL08,i want to meet the one cop who was using the hand sanitizerdamn cowards
wMtJPegwL08,the fact that hes more worried about how the video was leaked is mind blowing
wMtJPegwL08,no what he meant to say was how could you release this video that shows my department failing in the worst way
wMtJPegwL08,this breaks my heart to see cops standing there while hearing all the shots hitting and killing children there were enough trained officers with rifles to rescue the children
wMtJPegwL08,seriously this guy
wMtJPegwL08,dont let up uvalde we are with you
wMtJPegwL08,lesson learned from this a cops life is more valuable than ones child
wMtJPegwL08,all that tactical gear and long guns and they just stand there
wMtJPegwL08,this is so maddening my jaw dropped seeing the officer put hand sanitizer on like really theres a special place in hell for all of them
wMtJPegwL08,this is heartbreaking
wMtJPegwL08,imagine being more concerned about how a video was leaked then the fact that you have a coward police force that all need to be fired
wMtJPegwL08,those officers should been held accountable for this  this is crazy
wMtJPegwL08,incomprehensible i would have barreled down that hallway without a gun to protect those children no excuses for those officers
wMtJPegwL08,please anyone whos is in power thats not money hungry please do something they tried to hid this i get so angry please do something
wMtJPegwL08,seeing them hide behind each other is just  idk i have no words sick
wMtJPegwL08,its so sad a hallway filled with armed cowards the police officer getting hand sanitizer from the dispenser really made my blood boil
wMtJPegwL08,these cops should be imprisoned for abandonment of duty
wMtJPegwL08,it is truly infuriating to see the complacency of the police inside the school standing around for over an hour
wMtJPegwL08,just remember  an unarmed mom saved more kids than all those cops did
wMtJPegwL08,we need to hold them accountable and charge them for deciding to wait over an hour while children are being shot
wMtJPegwL08,nice to see how that mayors gonna jump right to  not getting to the cowardice and bumbling incompetence of the police but on how the video got released despicable
wMtJPegwL08,if you want something done you gotta do it yourself dont rely on anyone
wMtJPegwL08,glad that one cop had time to sanitize his hands that was an important part of the rescue plan
wMtJPegwL08,i literally almost threw up watching this i cant imagine what those poor children went threw and its scares me to death to send my kids to a public school
wMtJPegwL08,its truly horrifying how cowardly all police are
wMtJPegwL08,this is as upsetting as it comes
wMtJPegwL08,rip the kids who died while officers with shields just stood there imagine standing there while little angels and their teachers die

2X5oHpuD510,thank you so much for telling usany can i say
t5zsPtd_Qhs,ronaldo is unlikely to move to bayern munich as they would prefer a younger lewandowski replacement
t5zsPtd_Qhs,maguire if im conceding goals your scoring them
t5zsPtd_Qhs,if he play for chelsea next seasonit will be the biggest betrayal for united fans i thinkbut as arsenal supportes i feel that so many timesadebayornasrirvpfabregas
t5zsPtd_Qhs,the fact that ronaldo is 37 and is still the most spoken about in football give the guy his respect
t5zsPtd_Qhs,makes sensehuge wages even if they arent full for an old player when most teams are looking at longer contracts with younger players
t5zsPtd_Qhs,i dont think hes going to get the offers he thinks he deserves
t5zsPtd_Qhs,all signs are pointing towards chelsea and ronaldo is a goal scoring machine we need that consistent striker
t5zsPtd_Qhs,the presser kept asking questions hed already answered
t5zsPtd_Qhs,i think he just giving a pressure on the board because the lack of signing
t5zsPtd_Qhs,he should go to the us imagine the goals hed score hed go down as the best major league soccer player of all time
t5zsPtd_Qhs,hope he goes to chelsea
t5zsPtd_Qhs,harry maguire definitely played a part in this
t5zsPtd_Qhs,heard a rumour he is interested playing for sunderland afc and putting the championship trophy on his record
t5zsPtd_Qhs,one word for ronaldo is
t5zsPtd_Qhs,even as a man u fan i want him to go psg
t5zsPtd_Qhs,i hear a lot of talk from harry maguire about going i never see him go
t5zsPtd_Qhs,reece james and ben chilwell are gonna get alot of assists from crosses into the box with ronaldo lurking about
t5zsPtd_Qhs,he wants to continue but his age and salary makes it difficult for top clubs to buy him
t5zsPtd_Qhs,i dont think if he didnt have options that he would have dropped the transfer request
t5zsPtd_Qhs,bayern have to go in for him
t5zsPtd_Qhs,he will score 50 goals at chelsea as a liverpool fan i dont want that to happen
t5zsPtd_Qhs,a club who needs goals and not a teamplayer
t5zsPtd_Qhs,nobody achieve the success of cr7
t5zsPtd_Qhs,cr7 to chelsea fc is a good transfer
t5zsPtd_Qhs,ronaldo playing with messi would be a dream
t5zsPtd_Qhs,sources close to the portuguese talisman suggest the global superstar is interested in a move to the mls with his sights set on toronto fc
t5zsPtd_Qhs,cristiano ronaldo will stay at manchester united
t5zsPtd_Qhs,best card for ronaldo is to gamble on chelsea
t5zsPtd_Qhs,what about bayern he literally just told you about bayern
t5zsPtd_Qhs,i have a gut feeling that cr7 will stay maybe its false hope which is blinding me
t5zsPtd_Qhs,he will be in europa where he deserves to be
t5zsPtd_Qhs,he will go real madrid or psg or stay man united i heard he is playing till age 55 it is just  the beginning of his career
t5zsPtd_Qhs,chelsea hopefully
t5zsPtd_Qhs,never listen to the media
t5zsPtd_Qhs,i would love to see cristiano go back to sporting cp
t5zsPtd_Qhs,would be good to see him back at sporting lisbon i think now is definaetly the time
t5zsPtd_Qhs,a year back in portugal would do him well
t5zsPtd_Qhs,ronaldo need to go to chelsea they are missing a striker and ronaldo getting 24 goals in this worst united side isnt being talked enough
t5zsPtd_Qhs,i held up there with best my boyhood hero thats tainted now
t5zsPtd_Qhs,want to see him with messi in psg
t5zsPtd_Qhs,gotta feeling he will stay
t5zsPtd_Qhs,did she even listen to him he spent half his time talking about how bayern munich dont want him and the first question she asks is what about bayern munich
t5zsPtd_Qhs,the people saying hell join chelsea clearly live in the land of magic  and fairies
t5zsPtd_Qhs,i thought ronaldo the saviour was coming back home to win the league
t5zsPtd_Qhs,united should just let him go and rebuild with a new younger attacker
t5zsPtd_Qhs,he should go chelsea or bayern if robert  lawendowski leaves
t5zsPtd_Qhs,i wish he played with messi at least once
t5zsPtd_Qhs,juve in my opinion he can again say im back omme
t5zsPtd_Qhs,im really hoping chelsea dont bite and get ronnie if he did sign and did incredible then id happily be proven wrong
t5zsPtd_Qhs,my favourite footballer cristiano ronaldo
t5zsPtd_Qhs,he will stay at manchester united
t5zsPtd_Qhs,hes odds on still to stay at united think this is a plan by ronaldo to get glazers to start signing players
t5zsPtd_Qhs,they cant stop making videos about him every 3 hours a new vid pops up to be fair i click on every vid
t5zsPtd_Qhs,ronaldo probably to chelsea with frenkie de jong
t5zsPtd_Qhs,the reporter literally explained why bayern arent a possibility only for that clueless sky news correspondent to ask if bayern was a possibility
t5zsPtd_Qhs,i believe he is gonna stay
t5zsPtd_Qhs,he wants cl football and currently chelsea look promising unless united can get back to consistent top 4
t5zsPtd_Qhs,he will stay
t5zsPtd_Qhs,again if cr7 makes a move to man city not only will it be one interesting transfers but it all partys happy
t5zsPtd_Qhs,cr7 will stay if manunited make good signings
t5zsPtd_Qhs,as a man u fan please go to psg i would love to see the messi cr7 link up i can then die a happy man
t5zsPtd_Qhs,best move for him would be
t5zsPtd_Qhs,sell neymar and buy ronaldo please psg
t5zsPtd_Qhs,hed likely stay since he is already 37
t5zsPtd_Qhs,hes going arsenal artetas 40 year project is too good an opportunity to pass up
t5zsPtd_Qhs,he will be at manunited trust me
t5zsPtd_Qhs,hes going to city
t5zsPtd_Qhs,psg boss should consider to have ronaldo mbappe messi and ramos if his dream to win champions league is still more important to him
t5zsPtd_Qhs,bayern refused him reallyhe is the best ever and will fit everywhere big mistake from them
t5zsPtd_Qhs,yes chelsea all the way
t5zsPtd_Qhs,united lost pogba lindgard in this transfer window theyre 6th on the table theyre considered a big club but theyve only signed a 22 year old unknown lb
t5zsPtd_Qhs,im going to say something abit different  i can see him going to bvb
t5zsPtd_Qhs,sky sports right now  we need more views
25Ko3qPTHoA,tbh ive never particularly hated a specific brand but those colorful pencils which literally broke every second you write with made me rage a lot as a kid
25Ko3qPTHoA,i used to think rose art was the higher brand cause they were rarer and their crayons had a cool smell texture 
25Ko3qPTHoA,everyone knows what crayola smells like it smells like childhood
25Ko3qPTHoA,while i used crayola as a kid i feel people have confused roseart for craz art at least rose had the cool markers
25Ko3qPTHoA,crayola being so happy rn because shes not talking about how much she hates us
25Ko3qPTHoA,roseart im not mad im just disappointed
25Ko3qPTHoA,rose art is now owned by crazart
25Ko3qPTHoA,i feel like on a scale of crayola to crazy art its definitely floating in the toilet  you should do prang next  i hated those lol
25Ko3qPTHoA,the crayons were awful absolutely awful when i was a kid yes i agree we need financial compensation for such crappy crayons lol  great video thank you
25Ko3qPTHoA,out of topic but can i just say that her makeup looks absolutely gorgeous she looks so pretty
25Ko3qPTHoA,i have distinct memories of using roseart crayons in the early 90s it was literally like trying to color with candlewax
25Ko3qPTHoA,i specifically remember the rose art pink being my absolute least favorite accidentally picking up a roseart crayon from the crayon bin completely ruined a handful of my childhood drawings
25Ko3qPTHoA,lmao as an art teacher who gets irritated when her students make marker swords roseart wins by default for not being able to make swords with them
25Ko3qPTHoA,the only qualm i had with rose art was their crayons everything else was fine it was always the crazy art brand that i never ever ever stand
25Ko3qPTHoA,rose art just vibing
25Ko3qPTHoA,i apologize to all the teachers who i bought the roseart crayons for when i was contributing to the class art supplies
25Ko3qPTHoA,never really had rose art as a kid but crazart was the bane of my existence i always felt embarrassed when i had to whip out the crazart
25Ko3qPTHoA,i love these comparisons d man  it actually makes me legit mad that crazy art wastes all these resources on such a bad product xd
25Ko3qPTHoA,i will say rosearts colored pencil turquoise is still my favorite color of all time though i remember crazart sucking more than roseart as a kid 20072014ish
25Ko3qPTHoA,the feeling of realizing you have never used anything but the terrible versions of these
25Ko3qPTHoA,i remember the roseart working more like the crazart   i wonder if they changed their formulas by the 2000s
25Ko3qPTHoA,i think i was just so used to crayolas specific iconic shades that rosearts sliiightly different shades hurt my brain lolololol
25Ko3qPTHoA,we dont have rose art products in brazil  but we have those brands of crappy products toosimilar to cra z art and rose art
25Ko3qPTHoA,the crayons of rose art were more like wax candles than crayons dollar general brand crayons were better
25Ko3qPTHoA,crazart would be pretty good to give to a toddler to use cos theyre so cheap and nasty it wouldnt matter when they inevitably break or lose them
25Ko3qPTHoA,i vividly remember being a little girl and whining awwwww rose art when my grandparents gave me a tub of art stuff
25Ko3qPTHoA,i loved rose art for its vibrant color and how smooth it was when applied
25Ko3qPTHoA,honestly i never really had rose art but i hated crazart so much so im feeling validated
25Ko3qPTHoA,i distinctly remember the black rose art marker had a terrible smell and that it wasnt quite black it was more of a very dark green that was almost black
25Ko3qPTHoA,hey rae i just wanted to lyk that im loving your content atm keep up the good work
25Ko3qPTHoA,i noticed a dramatic change in the roseart crayons starting a few years ago they started to work nicely but their brand is destroyed by their initial low quality
25Ko3qPTHoA,wow interesting when i was a kid i remember hating crazy art roseart was always acceptable as it wasnt as offensive lollllll
25Ko3qPTHoA,i must say i was somewhat surprised by your conclusions in this review  i honestly figured crazart would be much better than rose art across the board  very interesting findings
25Ko3qPTHoA,ideadrawing a science diagram in artistic style
25Ko3qPTHoA,the one thing i love about rae is she can make me happy always
25Ko3qPTHoA,the rose art crayons are what you would find in the art teachers bin of crayons for the kids who didnt have art supplies
25Ko3qPTHoA,if a candle company made a crayola crayon scented candle i would toldly buy it
25Ko3qPTHoA,i used to love rose art specially their triangle pencils those helped so much with my uh hand posture and they were so creamy as well
25Ko3qPTHoA,thank you for doing this people need to watch this so they can avoid crazart at all times
25Ko3qPTHoA,i wonder what chloe rose art has to say about this video

uY0pDe3rqOg,sanitizing your hands apparently is more important than saving a childs life
uY0pDe3rqOg,really sad to watch cops with rifles retreating and leaving innocent children to die they should be ashamed of themselves i wish and hope that their names would be published
uY0pDe3rqOg,accountability needs to addressed during this horrific scenario
uY0pDe3rqOg,cops take a defensive posture and do not engage the assailant nothing but cowardice was on display by law enforcement
uY0pDe3rqOg,they all need to be fired
uY0pDe3rqOg,are they really well trained for this or was that not the issue
uY0pDe3rqOg,how do those guys sleep at night knowing kids were being murdered while they were standing there
uY0pDe3rqOg,if any of those officers had a kid in that classroom it would be a different story the officer were scared to do their job
uY0pDe3rqOg,this is why they need to put cameras with sound in classrooms
uY0pDe3rqOg,all of them should be publically fired and stripped of their bages bars and strides for their cowardis acts
uY0pDe3rqOg,and by the way people almost all those local police officer in uvalde came from the training and education program right there in uvaldes local junior college
uY0pDe3rqOg,waiting for the order
uY0pDe3rqOg,dude in plaid shirt with hand sanitizer and hands in pocket on an active shooter area of operation is beyond pathetic he should be the first to go
uY0pDe3rqOg,sanitizing your hands is a top priority
uY0pDe3rqOg,back up the blue line  we support the system it has to be done in a way ladies and gentlemen
uY0pDe3rqOg,seeing this makes the police look very negligible i dont understand normally i would back the police but i just cant in this case
uY0pDe3rqOg,they had everything they needed to get the job done the only thing they didnt have was courage what cowards
uY0pDe3rqOg,and yet the public does not question the situation as a whole they just believe a narrative
uY0pDe3rqOg,im sorry if is harsh but theyre cowards and now theyre doing what cowards typically do point fingers and blame someone else
uY0pDe3rqOg,this video is so upsetting because they swear to serve and protect and i didnt see that  herei see cowards with their guns running lol
uY0pDe3rqOg,that first handful of cops should have charged the room and taken down the suspect or die trying  shameful all around
uY0pDe3rqOg,every last one of them should be fired
uY0pDe3rqOg,the officer using the hand sanitizer and on his phone should be fired
uY0pDe3rqOg,i guess 15 cops with m16s and vest have to wait for backup for one armed teen
uY0pDe3rqOg,the video with audio of gunshots even with the screaming redacted was so hard to listen to horrible
uY0pDe3rqOg,their position as police officers makes them cowards allow me to explain once again
uY0pDe3rqOg, put monitoring systems in the classroom and around the school and give teachers access
uY0pDe3rqOg,this is disgraceful fire them all
uY0pDe3rqOg,i think a group of angry dads wouldve done better
uY0pDe3rqOg,if the shooter had not come to a complete stop at a stop sign you can bet those cops would have been all over him
uY0pDe3rqOg,they all need to be fired  prosecuted
uY0pDe3rqOg,wheres the good guy with a gun in this scenario  i mean there was plenty of guns in this scenario but where were the good guys
uY0pDe3rqOg,when the movie comes out we get to see the heroic side of the killer and the cops
uY0pDe3rqOg,im a coward too thats why i dont have a job serving and protecting all of them are cowards the community is better off without them
uY0pDe3rqOg,hand sanitizer wow worried about clean hands when kids are dying despicable
uY0pDe3rqOg,those cops should be ashamed
uY0pDe3rqOg,the guy who got hand sanitizer is classic moment and the other guy checking his phone  maybe he was playing candycrush ahhahaahahah  bad example for the true heroes out there
uY0pDe3rqOg,think about it if i could save as many innocent children or lose my jobi can get another jobif i die trying oh well atleast im going to heaven
uY0pDe3rqOg,police trained to runaway from danger
uY0pDe3rqOg,every cop in that school should be fired for darlington of duty  and cowedtey in the face of the enemy 
uY0pDe3rqOg,thats messed up
uY0pDe3rqOg,everyone of those cowards should resign
uY0pDe3rqOg,looks like police had a part in this
uY0pDe3rqOg,how the cops scare of a lil white boy with one gun this is crazy if he was a black boy they would of got him in a min  smh
uY0pDe3rqOg,truly pathetic response i hope everyone of them is haunted by those children till their dying breath
uY0pDe3rqOg,they were scared
uY0pDe3rqOg,the best way for cowards to get a stategovernment paycheck is to a cop in uvalde texas apparently
uY0pDe3rqOg,out of 50 cops only a few are braves think about it
uY0pDe3rqOg,nbc great ratings eh maybe try to hire real journalist  might help your ratings
uY0pDe3rqOg,im sure that if these were your children in that type of situation they wouldve never taken that much time to act
uY0pDe3rqOg,i wonder what these cowards would have done differently
uY0pDe3rqOg,throw the cowards in a room with the families let them face the consequences of their actions
uY0pDe3rqOg,the cops in this make me sic what a bunch of cowards
uY0pDe3rqOg,so it breaks the idea that more men with guns is the solution to gun violence
uY0pDe3rqOg,the police can shoot someone when they think  its a gun but when they know its a gun they look confuse and dont know what to do wow
uY0pDe3rqOg,a display of extreme cowardice at least the border was less cowardice than the rest who were there horrible horrible tragedy
uY0pDe3rqOg,obviously not an ar15 but you gotta love the way these crazed drug dealing gun grabbing democrat politicians and big media like twisting the story around
uY0pDe3rqOg,what is up with that one officer with his hands in his fing pockets what a loser
uY0pDe3rqOg,this is sickening
uY0pDe3rqOg,they tore the school down i say tear the police station down
uY0pDe3rqOg,good thing he sanitized his hands
uY0pDe3rqOg,are american police really that dumb omg all the police should be demoted and be brought to court for questioning
uY0pDe3rqOg,they where craven in their actions call it like it is
uY0pDe3rqOg,what is the name of the artist and do she have a website or instagram page i love her art
uY0pDe3rqOg,wow those kids didnt get to wait for shields
uY0pDe3rqOg,beyond sad
uY0pDe3rqOg,some run into the gunfire some dont  you need to know your men  which one are you
uY0pDe3rqOg,this looks like a big lawsuit to me you took an oath and out of all of the people kids are more vulnerable
uY0pDe3rqOg,this is so sad to see the kids get killed and the cops did nothing
uY0pDe3rqOg,i wouldnt be able to live with myself if i was one of those officers
uY0pDe3rqOg,seriously the cop is checking his phone well kids are getting short
uY0pDe3rqOg,protect and serve
uY0pDe3rqOg,breakfast tacos what breakfast tacos everybody knows its breakfast burritos taco tuesday and friday night tequila shooters
uY0pDe3rqOg,teachers should have ccws
uY0pDe3rqOg,how many good guys with a gun it takes to take down one bad guy with a gun anybody know
uY0pDe3rqOg,19 and 2 thats a count of 21 follow the numbers
uY0pDe3rqOg,veteran sf with down range experience need jobs
uY0pDe3rqOg,cowards to the end like the hero mother said
uY0pDe3rqOg,nice blouse what do you think she did with the rest of the curtains

TFE9wfAfudE,if noctua actually made a box fan id get it in a heartbeat
TFE9wfAfudE,love this homage to noctua im not an rgb guy unless im building for my nieces and nephews so i end up using pretty much nothing but noctua fans
TFE9wfAfudE,ive never wanted a computer more than this one honestly
TFE9wfAfudE,actually i believe the overall look could have improved with more custom painted panelsnoctua inspired but the near dead silence is still worth the extra  imo
TFE9wfAfudE,the noctua color scheme looks really good when the entire pc is going for the same palette
TFE9wfAfudE,honestly the noctua collab gpu was the excuse i needed to finally upgrade and its absolutely glorious also way quieter than my old vega 56
TFE9wfAfudE,ive been loving the latest pc build videos great vid the build actually looks rly good im just not sure if id use it in my own home
TFE9wfAfudE,i honestly love not only the performance but also the looks
TFE9wfAfudE,i absolutely love this colour scheme it because its the theme which makes it awesome well done would love a case and fans like these
TFE9wfAfudE,love the noctua color scheme just wish manufacturers made matching parts
TFE9wfAfudE,very nice test result i always wondered how a full noctua pc would perform
TFE9wfAfudE,noctua is the only pc brand i love
TFE9wfAfudE,had a real linus held up my motherboard moment watching this you know minus the amazing noctua brown
TFE9wfAfudE,i tried to listen to the noctua fans being whisper quiet when linus was demonstrating it but all i could hear was my own pc rattling hahaha
TFE9wfAfudE,i actually love the look of the entire noctua color scheme would go well with a leather chair
TFE9wfAfudE,ive always loved the notcua colors this actually made me envious lol such a great build
TFE9wfAfudE,i have been following and watching almost every single computer build you have done since the beginning and this is by far my absolute favorite ever
TFE9wfAfudE,holy shit there has never been a pc i would call a
TFE9wfAfudE,the pc actually looks really good surprisingly   that said i really wished more graphics cards used standard size fans even if they have to use 92 or 80mm ones
TFE9wfAfudE,this is slick  very impressive build well done folks
TFE9wfAfudE,damn if there is one pc i could have this would be it it looks amazing
TFE9wfAfudE,i always kinda liked the noctua look
TFE9wfAfudE,awesome build
TFE9wfAfudE,it fits our 200mm fan
TFE9wfAfudE,the noctua color scheme looks really good when you make the whole pc that color very neutral and pleasant the way the dark brown accents the beige
TFE9wfAfudE,i second that linus id buy it too what a beautiful build i hope they do an rtx 4080 version
TFE9wfAfudE,they really need to release these for all gpus seriously
TFE9wfAfudE,the 40 series better have this noctua collab id actually pay over msrp for that
TFE9wfAfudE,this is why i like that fractal design still has nonglass panel case option  you can put any good performance parts and dont worry how it looks inside
TFE9wfAfudE,i was kinda hoping youd replace the side panel with the big fan
TFE9wfAfudE,you know once you actually get components that can be color coordinated to the noctua brown it actually looks really pretty
TFE9wfAfudE,as a person who loves the noctua color scheme i see this as an absolute win i love the way this looks
TFE9wfAfudE,i remember when my 4600 ti fan died and fell out of the housing hanging by the copper wire lol
TFE9wfAfudE,best build you guys have ever done
TFE9wfAfudE,the amazing wooden pc that you guys built would of looked really cool with these noctua fans
TFE9wfAfudE,i built a system using all noctua fans in a corsair vengeance c70 case in military green that was a pretty sweet theme for a pc
TFE9wfAfudE,it looks surprisingly good actually would do great alongside retro furniture
TFE9wfAfudE,ive had the same noctua cooler for 6 years run it basically silent at 100 and its still going strong
TFE9wfAfudE,ive even installed noctua fans in my homemade composting toilet been running at full speed 247 for over a year now without a hitch
TFE9wfAfudE,i remember when noctua fans first got introduced always wished a case solution was made  well done all
TFE9wfAfudE,noctua needs to make a box fan asap and yes pc cases and boards time to step up
TFE9wfAfudE,if noctua doesnt make this available they are missing a good opportunity
TFE9wfAfudE,its no secret that here at ltt were giant enthusiasts of noctua products
TFE9wfAfudE,this is amazing i wish i could buy a case with that colour scheme to build my own noctua pc
TFE9wfAfudE,omg you guys must have had a blast custom making this its such a joy to see you guys goof off like this
TFE9wfAfudE,im not gonna lie i really like that look of that case its pretty badass looking honestly it looks like a modern day sleeper pc
TFE9wfAfudE,honestly the whole here at ltt are giant enthusiasts made me mad embrace the dad joke and go with it
TFE9wfAfudE,such a beautiful pc honestly wish i had the time and money to make my own like this
TFE9wfAfudE,adding custom cables in noctua scheme and etching schematics of their fan on that glass panel would be cool finishing touch
TFE9wfAfudE,these type of collaborations really need to happen more especially regarding the fact that the coming generations will only ever draw more power
TFE9wfAfudE,imao the build looks really beautiful in its own way with everything in noctua color scheme
TFE9wfAfudE,add some optical drives and this is my ideal pc from a cooling perspective
TFE9wfAfudE,this looks truly awesome a lot of personality i would totally rock a pc like this
TFE9wfAfudE,i want it
TFE9wfAfudE,finally i always said a pc themed this colour will look sick
TFE9wfAfudE,honestly my favorite build theyve ever done
TFE9wfAfudE,now that linus has showed it on ltt hopefully well actually see the noctua 30s out in the wild in approximately 3 to 2 years
TFE9wfAfudE,i love it the fans might not be cheap but they work extremely well and last
TFE9wfAfudE,as my life going on currently my dream of owning a gaming pc is burned down however watching these videos give some comfort
TFE9wfAfudE,noctua making an oscillating fan for cooling the gamer would be sick i hope theyre secretly working on that
TFE9wfAfudE,i have one of those 200mm fans in the front of my case had to mod the case slightly with a dremel to fit it
TFE9wfAfudE,if i had money this is the pc i would build though i would probably wait a few months and get an rtx 4000 series gpu
TFE9wfAfudE,the dust collector just resting on top of the little nubbins from the fans is hilarious
TFE9wfAfudE,ive always found noctua fans to be awesome looking guess im one of the weird ones
TFE9wfAfudE,ive always kind of liked noctuas color scheme nice to see a consistent build looks pretty good
TFE9wfAfudE,this is my favorite pc theyve made that is sooo cool 3

KSY2TXjeNjo,fowles is going out with class 
KSY2TXjeNjo,fantastic  plum and ionescu best players
KSY2TXjeNjo,candace was a class act all weekend for real great host
KSY2TXjeNjo,man even for an all star game sabrina hit tripdub watch she has all the potential in the world
KSY2TXjeNjo,why didnt they show sabrinas 4 pointer in the first half they showed the other 2 fun game to watch with no defense very entertaining
KSY2TXjeNjo,i need a kelsey plum jersey
KSY2TXjeNjo,finally an exciting wnba game
KSY2TXjeNjo,the wilson team
KSY2TXjeNjo,that dunk tho
KSY2TXjeNjo,that was a great tribute to britney griner in the 2nd half  thank you wnba  nba playersstaffs for trying to get her home
KSY2TXjeNjo,i need an wnba jersey just great overall
KSY2TXjeNjo,that mvp trophy looks like a participation trophy
KSY2TXjeNjo,i enjoyed the game seeing all my favorite players shout out to a q the best 3 point shooter ever in the wnba chicago sky represent
KSY2TXjeNjo,i love how ppl goin crazy bout that dunk
KSY2TXjeNjo,i hope sylvia fowles has her jersey retired in chicago she made the sky a team to relevancy in the late 2000s
KSY2TXjeNjo,they play better defense than the nba allstar games
KSY2TXjeNjo,lmao britney griner knew the laws she was breaking
KSY2TXjeNjo,great game
KSY2TXjeNjo,during the fast break i got up to go get a beer from my fridge and the women hadnt reached the basket yet on the other end
KSY2TXjeNjo,wait since when did the wnba have a 4 point line ive heard of some people talking bout it but never in action
KSY2TXjeNjo,not sure if plums basket shouldve counted in the beginning seems like passing to self to me but i may be wrong
KSY2TXjeNjo,plum is my favorite player she got a ratchet since washington
KSY2TXjeNjo,this announcer always has the flemmiest throat i dont know how hes gotten so far up the broadcast chain sounding like hes gurgling
KSY2TXjeNjo,this game looked on point happy for the wnba
KSY2TXjeNjo,jewell lloyd
KSY2TXjeNjo,i just need me a sabrina jersey
KSY2TXjeNjo,thank you for giving us an actress like breanna  im sorry for you but fenerbahce will be the champion of europe  thanks to queen stewart
KSY2TXjeNjo,love seeing women do their thing  keep cookin 
KSY2TXjeNjo,aint even know they had a all star game
KSY2TXjeNjo,whats  with cp3 mini log 3
KSY2TXjeNjo,best game ever
KSY2TXjeNjo,the future of the league is here
KSY2TXjeNjo,they knew no one was gonna make the 4 pointer so there was no spot for the stat
KSY2TXjeNjo,heres an ideaget the best womens  professional basketball players together in 2 teams having them play against each other competitively to showcase their abilities
KSY2TXjeNjo,imagine steph with a 4 pointer
KSY2TXjeNjo,why do they always let the other team score
KSY2TXjeNjo,this is def the most boring performance like i know theyall take it easy but should be a lil bit more competitive
KSY2TXjeNjo,i dont know about you but i am surely a home depot teams fan now
KSY2TXjeNjo,why didnt brittney grimer play
KSY2TXjeNjo,good job ladies
KSY2TXjeNjo,i didnt enjoy this though l know its suppose to be an easy game but a competition is a bit needed
KSY2TXjeNjo,if this is so great why does the nba have to subsidize it
KSY2TXjeNjo,why didnt fowles get the game ball
KSY2TXjeNjo,that all star game mvp trophy has to be the most pathetic thing ive ever seen lol wonder why they didnt post a video of that lol
KSY2TXjeNjo,theres an wnba all star
KSY2TXjeNjo,yikes a bunch of layups and the one half dunk are all the highlights
KSY2TXjeNjo,wnba supports convicts 42
KSY2TXjeNjo,so god damn boring need some fancy handles step backs dunks dimes
KSY2TXjeNjo,lol more people watched a fishing show
KSY2TXjeNjo,that was boring as hell
KSY2TXjeNjo,i need a sylvia fowles jersey anything on sale
KSY2TXjeNjo,anybody come from farod
KSY2TXjeNjo,they play with a vollyball he he he
KSY2TXjeNjo,wheres johnnea
KSY2TXjeNjo,interesting match
KSY2TXjeNjo,whos mvp
KSY2TXjeNjo,kelsey  kelsey kelsey grammer
KSY2TXjeNjo,it was fun
KSY2TXjeNjo,wife me kelsey plum
KSY2TXjeNjo,all wnba players miss britney grinner
KSY2TXjeNjo,no one is above the law clearly griner used drugs in russia
KSY2TXjeNjo,they had to shoot 3s cause nobody wants to see a layup line

uNt_ReLwk40,ive been on the fence for a while now i think im probably going to stick with steamos since it seems to be able to do everything i need anyway
uNt_ReLwk40,the same architecture should be performing similarly
uNt_ReLwk40,i really want to know more about the dock now are they setting this up to be a more a all around product in the future
uNt_ReLwk40,nice video to show very clear why we shouldnt waste time trying that with ours when we get our steam decks of course
9l1p7zolPyY,hope you guys enjoyed this one
9l1p7zolPyY,while everyone hits the middle
9l1p7zolPyY,joey and garnt be like when you gotta hang out with your buddies at 9 but you gotta solve a murder case at 10
9l1p7zolPyY,petite asian women whos battle cry sounds like a kitten
9l1p7zolPyY,when connor said it cost 500 dollars just for the tiles i died inside for him
9l1p7zolPyY,has anyone broke their hand before
9l1p7zolPyY,connor monkey smash
9l1p7zolPyY,connor protagonist
9l1p7zolPyY,so is nobody gonna talk about how kaho literally sounds like an anime girl while hitting those tiles  or how joey sounded like a martial arts master 
9l1p7zolPyY,connor to a beautiful woman why would you bring me to a hotel
9l1p7zolPyY,kaho yelled ittai then suddenly yelled what the fuck in a very smooth accent change
9l1p7zolPyY,after watching this 30 times im convinced that connor leveled up strength joey leveled up dex and garnt leveled up intelligence
9l1p7zolPyY,connor so are you good in physical excercises then or is it just
9l1p7zolPyY,connor used his raging ape strength to destroy and disintegrate those tiles
9l1p7zolPyY,connor wearing eastern clothing and garnt and joey wearing western clothing truly a cultural crosspollination moment
9l1p7zolPyY,kaho i think garnt is stronger physically
9l1p7zolPyY,i love how connor is all brute force monkey go but joey has like cleaner strikes somehow
9l1p7zolPyY,conner wears a kimono
9l1p7zolPyY,joey breaks 5 tiles says thats 50 of his power then tops at 10 infinite brain
9l1p7zolPyY,i think miss shibuya is a wonderful foil to connors monkeybrain  she adds a bit of style and panache and im sure meilyn appreciates the backup lol
9l1p7zolPyY,love seeing connor hang out with kaho their individual wholesome vibes act like multipliers to one another when they combine
9l1p7zolPyY,connor has anybody have a broken hand
9l1p7zolPyY,joey and garnt look like theyre on their way to a funeral while kaho and connor look like theyre in a festival episode
9l1p7zolPyY,and this is to go even further beyond  breaks 2 tiles
9l1p7zolPyY,i love how kaho has just joined connors crew but im not complaining i love her shes so cute and nice
9l1p7zolPyY,you shouldve brought sydney along for the sole purpose of seeing her beat garnt at this
9l1p7zolPyY,connor lets set the bar low by letting kaho go first
9l1p7zolPyY,connor lets set bar low by makeiing kaho first
9l1p7zolPyY,even after constantly missing the target garnt refused to do a joey and actually practise lining up the strike on the centre point xd
9l1p7zolPyY,kaho im a regular here
9l1p7zolPyY,garnt and joey be looking like they gotta go solve a big murder mystery after they done with this
9l1p7zolPyY,connor on the newest trash taste episode im afraid of hurting my wrist
9l1p7zolPyY,i love that kaho is a recurring character in these videos now
9l1p7zolPyY,damn conner is strong  garnt well
9l1p7zolPyY,kahos  what the fu  is the cutest thing ever
9l1p7zolPyY,kaho is like cannurs mentor that makes surprise appearances to help him
9l1p7zolPyY,connor you did really well congrats but kahos ei at successful five tiles just wins by default
9l1p7zolPyY,the problem isnt garnts strength its his aim
9l1p7zolPyY,i feel like 90 of the videos ive watched from connor is always the ones where hes always with kaho
9l1p7zolPyY,dude a clean strike that any 11 year old could replicate i actually laughed hard that was hilarious
9l1p7zolPyY,i love how kaho is just part of the gang now seems like just yesterday joey was just interviewing her for the first time
9l1p7zolPyY,this is one of the best videos ive seen so far garnts spirit must be broken but kaho was a fierce kunoichi
9l1p7zolPyY,how many stories has connor told about him growing up and getting in fights with kids in his neighborhoodschool monke brain and muscle memory apparently
9l1p7zolPyY,i spent 500 in tiles alone
9l1p7zolPyY,for the first time connors destructive tendencies have proven themselves as useful
9l1p7zolPyY,loved how this video had a tournament arc for all of them a training arc for garnt and a redemption arc for kaho
9l1p7zolPyY,joey you look so white
9l1p7zolPyY,its so funny that kaho said that garnt was strongest and then she beat him
9l1p7zolPyY,connor has any broke their hand
9l1p7zolPyY,ive been watching for 7 years even peaked on acid to these videos doesnt get more quality than this  much love connor xoxo
9l1p7zolPyY,wow kaho is savage
9l1p7zolPyY,the way that he laughed when joey said thats easy it was like haha good luck
9l1p7zolPyY,kaho is like the speedwagon of this group
9l1p7zolPyY,i love having kaho on these vids at this point shes an honorary trash tastee
9l1p7zolPyY,i love kahos energy in these videos so wholesome
9l1p7zolPyY,i feel bad for garnt honestly kaho thought hed do the best and yet she broke more tiles than him
9l1p7zolPyY,please keep making videos with kaho she is so wholesome and entertaining
9l1p7zolPyY,i come from the future for those confused if garnt breaks more than 4 he breaks time and space in a perfect loop
9l1p7zolPyY,i knew garnt wasnt hitting shit right when they did the practice swings hes my people
9l1p7zolPyY,joey and garnt straight up looking like loan sharks with their outfits when meeting connor
9l1p7zolPyY,kaho is pretty much the fourth member of trash taste at this point
9l1p7zolPyY,connor finally getting a well earned w
9l1p7zolPyY,connor a real monkeh
9l1p7zolPyY,this is like another variation of stress relief room the one where you destroy junks
9l1p7zolPyY,its official garnt has no hand eye coordination
9l1p7zolPyY,things i learned from this vid
9l1p7zolPyY,that emotion on garnts face at the end i know exactly how he feels
9l1p7zolPyY,seeing kaho go from prim excited schoolgirl to what the fu and cutting away was the hardest ive laughed this week
9l1p7zolPyY,love how she said garnt was the most physically capable
9l1p7zolPyY,joey thats easy
9l1p7zolPyY,you can see that the tiles are obviously scored in the middle  btw i want more kaho  she is adorable  i hope she makes a youtube channel someday
9l1p7zolPyY,kaho is definitely a fun addition to the trash taste boys
9l1p7zolPyY,can we just take a moment to apreciate how happy kaho was when connor said that joey was coming
9l1p7zolPyY,sometimes people kept thinking they have to aim properly at a target tried to shift their arm movement causing hiting the target at the wrong angle or misses it
9l1p7zolPyY,so correct me if im wrong and take into account its 4 am for me but at
9l1p7zolPyY,love this video that first try kaho did was so cute and funny at the same time swear id probably do no better than garnt these days haha
9l1p7zolPyY,garnt leaning way too hard into his protagonist stereotype he only broke 3 but thats because he didnt hit the center imagine if he did
9l1p7zolPyY,shibuya kaho and connor have amazing on screen chemistry great on screen duo
9l1p7zolPyY,love kaho keeps coming up in your video she so funny and bubbly hope to see her more often
9l1p7zolPyY,love the content this one was insanely fun to watch
9l1p7zolPyY,good job connor i knew you could do it you can definitely get 21 next time
9l1p7zolPyY,wait this is an actual sport id seen the tile smashing thing in megaton punch from kirby super star but i thought it was just made up for that
9l1p7zolPyY,im dying this is the kind of content that matters on the internet

xy0ZHMvvUnw,matt violently just shaking his tennis racket is relatable on so many levels
xy0ZHMvvUnw,this went from a wii game to a life story
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the golf part and the shaking remote is so relatable
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the most unrealistic part about this is that matt was easy to defeat
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the bowling portion had a better story than most modern movies
xy0ZHMvvUnw,abby not swinging her bat is so relatable
xy0ZHMvvUnw,my favourite sport has always been court
xy0ZHMvvUnw,i like how as his life goes poorly after the bowling the wii sports theme is sad and depressed but still playing
xy0ZHMvvUnw,on boxing i expected too see matt throwing a flurry of punches and hear standing here i realize
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the fact this has more emotion than any netflix show ive seen is quite an accomplishment
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the accuracy on the bowling was insanely accurate
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the pointer animation looks so accurate
xy0ZHMvvUnw,that sad version of the wii sports theme is a masterpiece
xy0ZHMvvUnw,this shit went from 0 to 100 real fucking quick after bowling
xy0ZHMvvUnw,the amount of relatable things on this channel is astonishing
xy0ZHMvvUnw,that mii bowling part is better than a lot of netflix movies
xy0ZHMvvUnw,this is a poisonous dose of nostalgia

TsfBczc7bS0,known to law enforcement
TsfBczc7bS0,everytime hes known to law enforcement its almost like theyre letting it happen
TsfBczc7bS0,warning signs just look at the kid
TsfBczc7bS0,they say the creep was known to law enforcement but as usual they dont bother telling us
TsfBczc7bS0,condolences  to the families  praying for strong recovery for the injured and those who are emotionally scaredupset and afraid
TsfBczc7bS0,good job sharing his name and face giving him the attention he wanted thanks for promoting what these people want
TsfBczc7bS0,nearly all of these evil people are known to law enforcement gee its almost like they let it happen
TsfBczc7bS0,he was known still did the thing people died community suffersthoughts and prayers nothing changes im sick of this
TsfBczc7bS0,suspects are always known beforehand and nothing done to prevent them from acting out
TsfBczc7bS0,i love how he acts like hes all that but is in fact the closest living relative to homo habilis that anyone could possibly locate
TsfBczc7bS0,this is not to glorify the shooter
TsfBczc7bS0,doesnt matter what what type of past someone has there is no excuse for this when did this start becoming a thing school shootings mass shootings its just horrible
TsfBczc7bS0,best to keep your emotional support pet within reach while arriving at the realization that hes a product of our society
TsfBczc7bS0,im old enough to remember the days when the fbi was a highly regarded and competent law enforcement agency
TsfBczc7bS0,he was suicidal he wants to kill his family and cops came to take knives from his home etc
TsfBczc7bS0,this  man is  the  devil from  hell my heart goes out  to the  family  who  last  their  love  ones from jamaica
TsfBczc7bS0,theyre always known but until he breaks the law theres nothing they can do
TsfBczc7bS0,dude had a neon warning from the get very unhappy with himself and the innocent pays for his weakness
TsfBczc7bS0,first and foremost sending my condolences to the families who lost a loved one
TsfBczc7bS0,way to go parents and police great job by all involved
TsfBczc7bS0,one more shooter that the authorities knew about and did nothing about i cant help but feel like theyre letting this happen
TsfBczc7bS0,those poor victims and families
TsfBczc7bS0,rest in peace to the victims
TsfBczc7bS0,cant judge a book by its cover huh this dude has got crazy all over him
TsfBczc7bS0,knowing a potential criminal is one thing being able to detain question or arrest is another
TsfBczc7bS0,i hope it doesnt turn out that the fbi have been watching this guy closely like a lot of these other shooters
TsfBczc7bS0,that was awesome  its a perfect example of how
TsfBczc7bS0,if we see kids in school that show signs on mental health we need to do more about it the parents declined medical help and now look
TsfBczc7bS0,my thoughts
TsfBczc7bS0,known to law enforcementof course he was this is always the case
TsfBczc7bS0,someone with no heart real psychopath
TsfBczc7bS0,the fact that i was on route to that area before the shooting is insane
TsfBczc7bS0,law enforcement usually know about this stuff not a surprise never a lone wolf always someone known to law enforcement
TsfBczc7bS0,my condolences to all the familys that lost love ones
TsfBczc7bS0,great choice of words from the mayor she says on live tv it was the bloodiest thats a wonderful choice of words for those who are traumatized from this event
TsfBczc7bS0,every video i saw of him had red flags all over it pretty wild to think no one saw anything coming rip to the victims of this
TsfBczc7bS0,just about the most slappable face ive ever seen in my entire life
TsfBczc7bS0,known to law enforcement every single time
TsfBczc7bS0,theres no excuse for this
TsfBczc7bS0,police have no lawful duty to protect people or children
TsfBczc7bS0,and his uncle was interviewed tonight and said there were no signs of violence or problems families need to wake up and be pro active get help
TsfBczc7bS0,please note that in this persons video 
TsfBczc7bS0,this shows that the red flag laws in place certainly are flawed his family is partly to blame as well
TsfBczc7bS0,history shows that most of the people that do this are always known to law enforcement yet law enforcement turns a blind eye to them
TsfBczc7bS0,of course there were warning signs
TsfBczc7bS0,i was taught to never judge a book by its cover but whenever i see photos of these homicidal aholes i think yep shoulda seen this coming smdh
TsfBczc7bS0,andy warhols 15 minutes of fame quote from the 60s still haunt me every time these sad things happen
TsfBczc7bS0,it seems there are warning signs in almost all of these tragic eruptions of violence with a firearm
TsfBczc7bS0,just looking at this guy you know theres a few screws missing
TsfBczc7bS0,looking back in hindsight is grammatically redundant no need for the looking back because that is exactly what the definition of hindsight is
TsfBczc7bS0,my condolences to the family i feel sorry to what happened
TsfBczc7bS0,so the uncle lied he wasnt a good kid he had a record he also had a violent video pulled off his youtube channel he planned this
TsfBczc7bS0,lord jesus have mercy on this nation my hearts 4 these families they had a opportunity to get this gentleman however they missed the opportunity
TsfBczc7bS0,and yet he was able to get a gun legally
rgOvwyQdQf4,my school doesnt allow  headbands jewellery of any kind socks that arent white  but thank you for the tips tho

35NJft4rqOc,this is a real endgame card i mean a 76 tall 84 wingspan monster how will  2k out do this on friday manute and bol bol friday
35NJft4rqOc,so you kinda wanna play him at c then because he steps in seems like power forwards move to the corners more than centers
35NJft4rqOc,i finally pulled an end game and it was tacko i had to sell him lol ill get his invincible and be ready for fridays drop
35NJft4rqOc,closed on a tacko at 123 mil right as this video ended thanks for the advice and breakdown ty
35NJft4rqOc,there will not be a better c in mt for the rest of the year tacko tuesday
35NJft4rqOc,time to splash the last bit of my mt on the mt goat end game card for sure
35NJft4rqOc,lets be honest though besides his jump shot  his size up escape hes the same card as his glitchedinvincible
35NJft4rqOc,love the video im also gonna get end game tacko to run with yao but who should be at pf
35NJft4rqOc,2k community really making glitched tacko expensive in july
35NJft4rqOc,i personally like invincibles better than endgame because even tho the arent better they are indeed funner to play with to me
35NJft4rqOc,what if we get lebron and mj on friday
35NJft4rqOc,got glitched taco
35NJft4rqOc,we just gonna ignore that this dude is 2213 in unlimited
35NJft4rqOc,995 done lets f go ty
35NJft4rqOc,running endgame yao and tacko is the ultimate cheese lol
35NJft4rqOc,perfect timing ty
35NJft4rqOc,should i sell my endgame kobe or keep him got him for 480 and have a mil mt
35NJft4rqOc,should i keep my galactic tacko with like 50 hofs or get one of the new ones
35NJft4rqOc,hello ty new sub here hope everyone have a good day today i am really trying to get the endgame jokic thoughts on him so far
35NJft4rqOc,decided to waste 100k mt packed him like 50k mt in holo version
35NJft4rqOc,would invincible tacko be just as good as end game or is there a massive difference
35NJft4rqOc,can he shoot corner 3 on current gen
35NJft4rqOc,i just pulled invincible tack fall on 1 tacko  pack omg
35NJft4rqOc,i might just use anniversary until glitch gets cheap
35NJft4rqOc,is endgame yao still worth keeping for pf so i can play them together or should i sell
35NJft4rqOc,this card is scary
35NJft4rqOc,what do people spend on the game to get a team like that
35NJft4rqOc,have glitch tacko and signature series yao who to play c and who to play pf
35NJft4rqOc,cant wait to run him and yao at pg and sg
35NJft4rqOc,damn son that was me you were playing

G8gb9q7lOEg,thanks for warning viewers about the soon to be obsolete series 3 its baffling that apple is still selling it when its days are numbered

G8gb9q7lOEg,i will not buy an apple watch until they use 2nm chip that will be another 3 more years to wait

G8gb9q7lOEg,leaksare always better than reality
G8gb9q7lOEg,seems all you do is take everybody elses info that theyve already reported  none of it is your info and literally nothing new here
G8gb9q7lOEg,if not at least 23 days of battery then it is nothing to even think at
G8gb9q7lOEg,flat glass is weaker than curved this is why car designers dont do flat anymore

SeaZbMJx4e8,when the rich rob the poor they call it businesswhen the poor rob the rich they call it violence  mark twain
SeaZbMJx4e8,its almost as if the word lobby is a widely accepted euphemism for bribe but without any of the criminal consequences
SeaZbMJx4e8,this shit happens everywhere in every country all these politicians live for their own interests
SeaZbMJx4e8,always amused by the word lobbying for bribes and corruption
SeaZbMJx4e8,uber used to pay people to post positive experiences of using the app and negative experiences of using traditional taxis i see they still do
SeaZbMJx4e8,i always said this if we started an unregulated taxi company with an app would be shut down in a week but uber can do it
SeaZbMJx4e8,uber treated drivers very badly before the court ruling they thought drivers are slaves  i am one of the uber unfair victims
SeaZbMJx4e8,light fines should not be the only thing hanging over the heads of corrupt officials
SeaZbMJx4e8,just fyi the founder was hated by everyone but he was effective then again you could also be effective if you had unlimited cash coming from investors
SeaZbMJx4e8,all big companies are doing it everyday lobbyingbribing
SeaZbMJx4e8,how shocking cannot believe a politician would stoop so low
SeaZbMJx4e8,remember kids you can change any law you want with the right amount of money
SeaZbMJx4e8,its time for them to go now then again it tlf are to blame for giving them the license one of them needs to be held accountable
SeaZbMJx4e8,what is a scandal is the fact that for decades the taxi licenses have been used for speculation
SeaZbMJx4e8,this is what reeks about british parliamentary standards  nothing new i know but the rot has intensified and the breaches are more brazen than ever
SeaZbMJx4e8,what politicians lining their own pockets
SeaZbMJx4e8,thanks to uber and the increased competition i get ripped off much less and i am using licensed taxis much more often than i used to
SeaZbMJx4e8,this is basically corruption  rules are vague  the fact that they did not report it meant they took the easiest route and wanted to hide it
SeaZbMJx4e8,this is where libertarians are right
SeaZbMJx4e8,i always use proper taxis and havent been raped or murdered by them so i shall continue with them
SeaZbMJx4e8,i would love to know the details for the deal done in new zealand  how do i find out it was done on the qt as well
SeaZbMJx4e8,declared properly
SeaZbMJx4e8,this government is rotten to the core i just hope people remember that for the next general election in two years
SeaZbMJx4e8,hey taxi advocate people accepted what uber was doing because taxis have been run like a cartel in most major cities around the world
SeaZbMJx4e8,i wonder how files get leaked in situations like these strategic move to lower the likelihood of some to get the seat of pm
SeaZbMJx4e8,as much as i loathe the bbc
SeaZbMJx4e8,and im sure they got paid a lot of cash as well undeclared and tax free
SeaZbMJx4e8,people who was involved with lobbying and ministers who was involved should be prosecuted and put them behind bars for long time including chancellor
SeaZbMJx4e8,ah yes the all powerful uber lobby
SeaZbMJx4e8,lobbies fight for their corporate interests at the expense of the people and their interests in the us lobbies give campaign donations to politicians which is essentially legal bribery
SeaZbMJx4e8,famlia deus ptria liberdade
SeaZbMJx4e8,uber the name alone says a lot  perfected commodification of labor a neoliberal dogma eg use abuse and axe as required
SeaZbMJx4e8,you do know this guy is gonna buy his stock back once its crashed dont you
SeaZbMJx4e8,gotta love tory corruption
SeaZbMJx4e8,in the us they do not have these issues because lobbying is legal and nobody questions it
SeaZbMJx4e8,the should have lincense suspended pending a formal inquiry
SeaZbMJx4e8,emptiness of the mind
SeaZbMJx4e8,such meetings are no big secret many companies in many countries have them
SeaZbMJx4e8,i admire modi for saying british education system was meant to create a servant class
SeaZbMJx4e8,lobbied you mean paid politicians
SeaZbMJx4e8,if there are secret laws how do i know murder is still illegal
SeaZbMJx4e8,youre surely not suggesting there was anything or anyone corrupt in government are you
SeaZbMJx4e8,i cant say anything to uber but its the government who is to blame
SeaZbMJx4e8,im so unsurprised the tories would attempt to destroy the black cabbies jobs for a private firm donation
SeaZbMJx4e8,i had a feeling this news would involve some of the con runners leaked
SeaZbMJx4e8,do uber drivers in uk need to undertake the knowledge
SeaZbMJx4e8,ahhh rules were followed  thats alright then no chance of cheating the system there
SeaZbMJx4e8,its time for a boycott against uber we can use other options not related to criminal activities let the uber owners starve
SeaZbMJx4e8,first the uber drivers crime spree and now this
SeaZbMJx4e8,international consortium of investigative journalists
SeaZbMJx4e8,they are saying it like uber invented lobbying
SeaZbMJx4e8,why am i not suprised they did the same in america
SeaZbMJx4e8,corrupt torieswho knew
SeaZbMJx4e8,ruleif anything moves smoothly to usurp the encombant industry in spite of longstanding regulation its path is being cleared by highly incentivised press and politiciansthink taxisnow windfarms
SeaZbMJx4e8,lobbing its another word for corruption
SeaZbMJx4e8,how many of those politicans who went to secret meetings are currently running to be prime minister
SeaZbMJx4e8,bbc continues to flatly ignore  fails reporting on the dutch farmers
SeaZbMJx4e8,its ok its just corruption
SeaZbMJx4e8,why they call it lobbying  why not say it what it is coroption
SeaZbMJx4e8,the translation for the word uber is exploitation con  servatives favourite hobbie
SeaZbMJx4e8,lobbying aka bribing politicians to enact laws favouring you
SeaZbMJx4e8,these people are the most dramatic about everything youre a damn taxi driver get a real job
SeaZbMJx4e8,politicians for sale  what a shocker  and yet nothing will change d
SeaZbMJx4e8,they need sacking and uber need sending back to the usa 
SeaZbMJx4e8,capitalism at its very worstor is it professional politicians at their worst
SeaZbMJx4e8,did they get the change they demanded and find the mole
SeaZbMJx4e8,politicians need a licence
SeaZbMJx4e8,another tory controversy involving under tha table cash never in a million years
SeaZbMJx4e8,uber is new at this thats why they got caught
SeaZbMJx4e8,this same corrupt shit happened in finland too
SeaZbMJx4e8,with this high technology we need to replace all human governors with ai robot governors
SeaZbMJx4e8,lol this isnt new news glad more people know about it though
FqNEx17crMI,i just love celine she is so cultured  brave aka the real gangsta
FqNEx17crMI,i literally love celine

StJwBdruUu0,whoever did this is a coward targeting innocent lives especially children who arent able to defend themselves i pray no one was hurt
StJwBdruUu0,disgusting and unacceptable sad families cant do anything outside in their communities and feel safe
StJwBdruUu0,im getting sick of praying for people about something that shouldnt even be a problem
StJwBdruUu0,i feel bad for these kids you cant even peacefully play a sport and not worry about getting shot
StJwBdruUu0,credit the coach credit whoever but lets not forget the kids here they knew what to do immediately and did it without hesitation proud of you kiddos
StJwBdruUu0,im glad to see that the kids knew what to do
StJwBdruUu0,its a shame that this is gonna keep happening and nothing is done
StJwBdruUu0,oh this is absolutely terrifying you cant be safe anywhere
StJwBdruUu0,its a shame that its basically safe to go no where at this point
StJwBdruUu0,glad no one got hurt keep safe everyone
StJwBdruUu0,my brother is the pitcher who ran off the mound i wasnt there but he came home in tears and is still messed up to this day
StJwBdruUu0,that is so sad its like people cant go outside and have fun anymore without constantly fearing that something bad is going to happen
StJwBdruUu0,i give that dad props on covering some one elses kid
StJwBdruUu0,you can hear the bullets whizzing by thats actually insane im glad everyone was alright
StJwBdruUu0,omgseems like we cant really go out into the public with the feeling of being safe the paranoia and anxiety of it all going out in the modern day america
StJwBdruUu0,why the hell did the mom think it would be alright to livestream it and scream live shooter in front of all of the scared children truly disgusting
StJwBdruUu0,who would do this at a childrens game this crazy violence needs to stop
StJwBdruUu0,you can be sure americas favorite pass time is self defense i bet if the coach had a fire arm none of this wouldve happened
StJwBdruUu0,am i the only one who thinks an adult screaming in terror three times theres a live shooter is the biggest child of the group
StJwBdruUu0,baseball game with a shooter nearby nothing more american than that thankfully no one was hurt
StJwBdruUu0,the american gun culture is the weirdest thing ever ive seen cultures doing some quirky things but i would take that any day compared to this
StJwBdruUu0,you can hear this moms fear as she rushes for safety
StJwBdruUu0,i feel so bad that would be so scared in that situation god bless her
StJwBdruUu0,this is the most american little league game ive ever seen
StJwBdruUu0,that guy that tripped and fell at the very start in the red shirt has me dying  horrible situation tho
StJwBdruUu0,this is why we need law abiding citizens with balls
StJwBdruUu0,how did this end did someone call the cops was there actually a live shooter at the game or nearby did anyone get hurt
StJwBdruUu0,imagine worrying more about views than capturing the death of a child on video
StJwBdruUu0,my neighbors were there while it happened and something that was bad is that the son who was playing was separated from the rest of his family
StJwBdruUu0,ridiculous that we live in a country that cares more about someones alleged right to carry a gun than the rest of our right to live free and peaceful
StJwBdruUu0,again this happened literally a few months ago elsewhere the frequency at which this is happening is disgusting
StJwBdruUu0,oh my god we get it you dont like it when your kid loses to the other team tone it down a notch will ya
StJwBdruUu0,this is why i take back my wishes of wanting to live in america
StJwBdruUu0,yes film it dont call 911 or take cover or anything rational
StJwBdruUu0,the spectator just told the woman to stop the live why would she do that is she working with the shooter
StJwBdruUu0,so were they shooting just near the baseball field or was someone actually on the field it looks like there was just gunshots nearby not actually shooting at them
StJwBdruUu0,if only there was a way to protect yourself and others
StJwBdruUu0,thoughts and prayers again
StJwBdruUu0,i cant believe they interrupted americas favorite past time with a game of baseball
StJwBdruUu0,its came to the point where we have to teach our young kids howwhat to do if theres ever a live shooter
StJwBdruUu0,great mom for making things worse yelling theres a shooter
StJwBdruUu0,i balled my eyes out watching this
StJwBdruUu0,this is getting ridiculous
StJwBdruUu0,what a shame
StJwBdruUu0,the country is going downhill what is wrong with people i like that the coaches first priority was to protect the children
StJwBdruUu0,this makes me wonder how humans arent extinct
StJwBdruUu0,thats so screwed up that little kids actually knew right off to duck for cover
StJwBdruUu0,i have a feeling the shooter might be a parent disappointed at there child while he was in the game  just a theory on how the shooting might have started
StJwBdruUu0,oh wow i hope them people ok
StJwBdruUu0,you live in the worst country on earth i feel sorry for the chunk of you good people that have to deal with these things
StJwBdruUu0,wait was there really a live shootingshooter was that sound really a gun fire i hope nobody got hurt if it really was a gun fire
StJwBdruUu0,why is it that countries with stricter gun laws then the us have significantly less gun homicides then us
StJwBdruUu0,how many deaths and scares is it going to take to change the laws and amount of guns
StJwBdruUu0,this has happened twice this year
StJwBdruUu0,thank god everyone was ok
StJwBdruUu0,who would just drop to the ground right in the open thats just stupid id run super far
StJwBdruUu0,back to god for protection from all evil  this is horrible
StJwBdruUu0,as she rushes to safety
StJwBdruUu0,good to see she had enough brain power to stop her live stream and put her phone away and actually attempt to protect a child all while staying calm 
StJwBdruUu0,she obviously recorded because she wanted the attention
StJwBdruUu0,lmfao at the lady trying to stop the mother from filming who did she think she was the community supervisor
StJwBdruUu0,coaches braver than the uvalde cops
StJwBdruUu0,probably not the best time to be funny but imagine one of the kids took this as an opportunity and stole bases and scored a run
StJwBdruUu0,this has always happened all of the time everywhere
StJwBdruUu0,amazing how not one person had ccw
StJwBdruUu0,i cant tell the difference between a gun shot or a firework so i would have been standing there like
StJwBdruUu0,folks in the hood wouldve got down then when it stopped got up and kept playing anyone hurt  no  playball
StJwBdruUu0,the cycle never ends
StJwBdruUu0,all you can do at that point is cover as many kids with your body craziness
StJwBdruUu0,yet another reason why gun laws need to change
StJwBdruUu0,i bet the guy that started the shooting was mad because the team he liked was losing
StJwBdruUu0,didnt something similar happen not to long at another little league game
StJwBdruUu0,how many times you gotta say theres a live shooter  chill out lol so many cowards in this world
StJwBdruUu0,gotta record phones out is more important than anything else
StJwBdruUu0,why is us media ignoring a video of hunter weighing crack
StJwBdruUu0,say it 1 more timetheres a live shooterits  just a reinactment of the congressional baseball game
StJwBdruUu0,btw the person who was shooting was targeting a car that had nobody in it in the parking lot not the baseball field
StJwBdruUu0,inside edition all of the terror and none of the facts
StJwBdruUu0,that lady needed to keep it together for the kids you have to be brave and get control
StJwBdruUu0,welcome to another edition of summer from hell its going to be good times
StJwBdruUu0,what was the point of her filming and screaming what was happening as if everyone else didnt realise so ignorant smh

VdLf4fihP78,this is why i refuse to wear any sort of clothing
HESYWyrMXTg,lets dew it
HESYWyrMXTg,hi guga great video here are some video ideas
HESYWyrMXTg,i bet guga just sits there for hours and thinks what the next video will be about
HESYWyrMXTg,hi guga i got some ideas for dry aging
HESYWyrMXTg,gugas side dishes always look nice but for me his side dishes are not really  side dishes more like a main dish
HESYWyrMXTg,ive always been disgusted by bone marrow  but if i had the chance to try one of gugas dishes with bone marrow i wouldnt hesitate to say yes
HESYWyrMXTg,youve gotten an insane following and high reputation for steaks on youtube guga i really hope you plan on opening a steakhouse in the future
HESYWyrMXTg,idea try dry aging in a few different types of mustard like stoneground strong english mustard and maybe ground mustard seed
HESYWyrMXTg,how was the steak leo
HESYWyrMXTg,hey guga can you put a marinating chamber to the test and see if it really is as good as leaving meat to marinate overnight
HESYWyrMXTg,i was just wondering whether the bone marrow that you used to confit the steak is reusable or not would be interesting to know
HESYWyrMXTg,turning 32 saturday making me a 27 year long vegetarian yet here i am again watching these men eat the finest and best prepaired steaks and meat
HESYWyrMXTg,guga i deep deep fried this in bone marrow
HESYWyrMXTg,wow those steaks before cooking looked absolutely amazing kinda like a cross between wagyu and angus
HESYWyrMXTg,can you make something with your favourite type of fish we love the steak but i think itd be interesting seeing a fish experiment
HESYWyrMXTg,every time i watch gugas videos
HESYWyrMXTg,once again guga never disappoints
HESYWyrMXTg,that bone marrow butter is next level i love it much more every time i make it
HESYWyrMXTg,i loved the part where he said its marrow time
HESYWyrMXTg,i really love gugas videos theyre so therapeutic to watch
HESYWyrMXTg,i feel like gouges side go equally as hard as the steaks i request a new series call
HESYWyrMXTg,he confit the steak in the bone marrow
HESYWyrMXTg,since it can solidify as butter do you think you can dry age a steak in bine marrow
HESYWyrMXTg,oh myi hope these two guys really appreciate to be able to try your experiments
HESYWyrMXTg,i watched this whole episode with my mouth open
HESYWyrMXTg,guga i love watching your content you change how think about steaks
HESYWyrMXTg,guga if you see this please do a dryage steak with saffron no one has ever done it
HESYWyrMXTg,guga this channel has changed my life no more well done unseasoned steaks for me and my house thank you
HESYWyrMXTg,investing in crypto now should be in every wise individuals list in some month up sees time youll be ecstatic with the decision you made today
HESYWyrMXTg,i love how guga always forgets about the side dish
HESYWyrMXTg,hi guga can you dry age using tomato or barbecue sauce
HESYWyrMXTg,does garlic powder and paprika burn too easily if so everybody may have been making a huge mistake when they fry things coated in cajun seasoning
HESYWyrMXTg,giga should run a tournament where he makes steak multiple different ways  the judges have to rank them all
HESYWyrMXTg,i hope i get to eat one of gugas steaks one day
HESYWyrMXTg,id honestly like these comparison videos to be shot in separate rooms where all 3 can give their completely
HESYWyrMXTg,if he forgot the taste of the previous steak after tasting the last dish that right there is delicious beard man is on point
HESYWyrMXTg,is it possible to dry age a steak with wagyu tallow if yes then itll be an interesting one to know about
HESYWyrMXTg,delicious food i was craving it the minute the video started
HESYWyrMXTg,i absolutely have to cook up some bone marrow i see it in the store all the time next time for sure
HESYWyrMXTg,it must be rough being leo hes out here having to choose between having his own opinion and getting invited back for more steaks lol
HESYWyrMXTg,these 2 guys are beyond freaking lucky to enjoy these steaks with guga
HESYWyrMXTg,could we see some steaks dryaged in heinz hp sauce guga  brits seem to adore that stuff
HESYWyrMXTg,id be curious to know if actually breading an deep frying the steak changes the sucess of bone marrow and butter
HESYWyrMXTg,please have a contest where one of your viewers wins a trip to just taste your steaks im dying watching these
HESYWyrMXTg,did the steak affect the rest of the bone marrows flavor what else could you do with that
HESYWyrMXTg,i watch guga like if i will ever cook or get anything he makes
HESYWyrMXTg,i just want to be in gagas circle of friends that gets to eat this food 
HESYWyrMXTg,leo really has gotten better in front of the camera kudos to that dude itd be weird without him now
HESYWyrMXTg,guga you never cease to impress me
HESYWyrMXTg,can you combine bone marrow wagyu tallow and compound butter
HESYWyrMXTg,at work our chef roasts bone marrow for our house soup and i salivate every time he roasts them the scent is insane
HESYWyrMXTg,uma calabresa acebolada de bar reimaginada por guga foods com batata e temperos nota mil this is a truly great sidedish inspired in brazilian bars congratulations once again
HESYWyrMXTg,hi guga 
HESYWyrMXTg,man guga i wish i was one of your nephews you eat way too good
HESYWyrMXTg,great taste is always straight if i would go for it i would go for butter of god instead of just fat out of the bone marrow
HESYWyrMXTg,oh you gonna love this idea guga i got a good one maybe youre already doing it who knows
HESYWyrMXTg,i would think you could reuse the bone marrow another thought possibly use that to saute mushrooms andor onions for a side
HESYWyrMXTg,heres something i dont think youve tried
HESYWyrMXTg,guga i would love to see you combine the bone marrow fried steak with the butter of the gods would that make the steak beyond perfection
HESYWyrMXTg,id love to cook for you guga
HESYWyrMXTg,confit is not the same as deep frying this was confit awesome video as usual
HESYWyrMXTg,i want to see a dry aged steak in appelstroop its a sweet dutch applespread that goes well with bread or cheese
HESYWyrMXTg,i put garlic powder on my steak like you did sous vide too but it gives my steak a weird flavour i dont understand it
HESYWyrMXTg,hi guga great video here are some video ideas make the best hamburger side dish and steak youve ever made in one video  love your videos
HESYWyrMXTg,will you double dry age a steak dry age it for 30 days cut off the shell then dry age it again for 30 more days
HESYWyrMXTg,ill see your beef tallow and raise you bone marrow looks absolutely amazing
5NNO5Kb-PZo,when he said that the projectors projections were touchscreen my jaw literally dropped  i dont think ive been this impressed by technology in hot minute
5NNO5Kb-PZo,that projector is what people 10 years ago thought todays technology would look like incredible
5NNO5Kb-PZo,the projector is honestly the sponsor with the best product i have seen in 14 years
5NNO5Kb-PZo,love my galaxy tab dex is seriously the most underrated feature on a tablet
5NNO5Kb-PZo,things he missed about the tab s7
5NNO5Kb-PZo,im impressed of that projector the future tech is coming
5NNO5Kb-PZo,this projector makes it feel like were in the future
5NNO5Kb-PZo,man i love watching cool things i cant afford
5NNO5Kb-PZo,i think once that projector becomes a more portable size it will be the standard for tablets
5NNO5Kb-PZo,the app rotation control helps so much with the apps that dont want to go into landscape mode makes the tablet a much much better experience

oYhRPiVPA3c,planned obsolescence is always the lamest excuse from manufacturers this stuff aint cheap just made cheap
oYhRPiVPA3c,i forgot to talk about windows 11 system requirements in the video
oYhRPiVPA3c,i love how all these companies virtue signal when it comes to the environment but keep filling up landfills with their devices
oYhRPiVPA3c,customerhi my fuel pump is not working i want to buy a new one
oYhRPiVPA3c,and then we hear such buzzwords as sustainable and green from corporations overwhelming hypocrisy is pretty much the cause of the sorry state the world is today
oYhRPiVPA3c,all these happened because tech companies started striving to be the richest company in the world with more money stashed than they can ever spend in a lifetime
oYhRPiVPA3c,you hit the nail on the head
oYhRPiVPA3c,about android and google having control over security patches theyve been working on exactly that for about 5 years now
oYhRPiVPA3c,ive actually got something to say about the laptop portion
oYhRPiVPA3c,it would be great to see companies being made to make their products more sustainable
oYhRPiVPA3c,just two corrections
oYhRPiVPA3c,very informative video it is a shame that tech companies have duped people into accepting 23 year shelf life for their phones
oYhRPiVPA3c,watching this on my 2014 ipad air which still works as well as the day i bought it
oYhRPiVPA3c,talks about repairability and freedom
oYhRPiVPA3c,hey hugh jeffreys
oYhRPiVPA3c,absolutely agree the way these corporations work and their anticonsumer practices infuriates me i havent owned an apple product since the original iphone in 2007 for precisely this reason
oYhRPiVPA3c,another one i noticed is deliberately  restricting features to pay more for the same heres an example
oYhRPiVPA3c,great video  love your content  please keep up the good fight and making people aware of what these unscrupulous tech companies are doing
oYhRPiVPA3c,hey hugh you are a legend mate love the vid style with you presenting in this style
oYhRPiVPA3c,very informative video i wish more consumers were aware of these tactics companies deploy and made better informed decisions
oYhRPiVPA3c,thats why i recently bought an ipod the simple idea of being able to repair and upgrade a device like that is so enticing to me
oYhRPiVPA3c,thank you for creating awareness of this nonsense hugh the sharks will always want more and more and someone will have to stop them
oYhRPiVPA3c,this video serves as a wakeup call for companies and consumers alike welldone
oYhRPiVPA3c,ive been saying these exact same things for over a decade
oYhRPiVPA3c,a good way to combat planned obsolescence never buy a phone without an unlockable bootloader
oYhRPiVPA3c,this is actually a reviting issue  good food for thought  i do always truly believe that we dont own anything in this world
oYhRPiVPA3c,you are actually right
oYhRPiVPA3c,i love that we have great options of buying a new device id also love the option to keep using my current one for as long as i choose to
oYhRPiVPA3c,great video hugh  i repair iphones every day and its becoming harder an harder to repair them even something as simple as a battery keep up the good content mate
oYhRPiVPA3c,my moto z runs android 10 with the last months security patch android 11 could work as well
oYhRPiVPA3c,ive always thought the same but had no platform to vent my frustrationam glad am subscribed to this channel
oYhRPiVPA3c,brilliant show sir  hope germany and the eu develops teeth against anti consumerism greed  the us will hopefully keep these powerful companies in check
oYhRPiVPA3c,corps should be forced to assist with eol of their products by way of making removing software locks available
oYhRPiVPA3c,this is exactly the kind of video that needs to be in the trending tab
oYhRPiVPA3c,this video is pure facts
oYhRPiVPA3c,thank you for raising awareness about this problem
oYhRPiVPA3c,im still using my galaxy s5 which ive repaired a couple of times
oYhRPiVPA3c,i would do absolutely anything to make the ftc give even the slightest bit of a shit about the abusive practices of major monopolistic companies like apple and microsoft
oYhRPiVPA3c,excellent video hugh and so so true
oYhRPiVPA3c,this kind of covering is what we really need thank you 
oYhRPiVPA3c,thank you for presenting a concise and informative issue facing many consumers today
oYhRPiVPA3c,and then apple dares to say that they sell the adaptator separately to protect the environment lol

xj6GikPbhdQ,linus is such a nerd when it comes to attention to detail i love it
xj6GikPbhdQ,it is truly amazing how far you have come and knowing this is not all you want to accomplish is even more impressive

xj6GikPbhdQ,i can only imagine the
xj6GikPbhdQ,i love how they actually care about the quality of their products
xj6GikPbhdQ,ltt today is like the early days of apple full of passion dedication and innovation i hope that they will continue to be like that
xj6GikPbhdQ,i love the detail and thought you put into every design its great to see a company so passionate about their products

1SAezMUB8sw,i find dominos really good since i rely more on the sauce and crust and prefer little cheese
6DYgImG1CKo,this lady seems so cool shes scientific but also super poetic and grounded
6DYgImG1CKo,this was so informative and sweet to learn at the same time 3
6DYgImG1CKo,i wouldve been really interested in what shed have to say about people on the aromanticasexual spectrum
u53NWioihto,so true
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,even after they knew it was bs they were still trying to punish these officers absolutely disgusting
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,i stand with the agents  theyre being judged by a kangaroo court and punished for political reasons  they did nothing wrong  this is a moral disgrace
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,this administration their officialsfrom the president vicepresident cabinet members right down the lineand the democratic party are without shame  they are disgraceful
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,saying biden lied is like saying biden breathed
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,the only time joe biden ever got anything right is when he said lets go brandon
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,im so sick of our whole judicial system doing nothing about anything they are useless
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,im going to be the most transparent president in history  trafficker in chief
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,the president and vice president should be held accountable for their lies
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,throw these government officials in jail enough is enough we the american people demand justice
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,once again  protecting the criminals  and punishing the police 
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,i wasnt even aware this was still being investigated that means they wasted more tax payer money and work hours on a nonsense charge
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,jessica would back china joe no matter how awful he was how do these people live with themselves being so phony 
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,gov abbott has the right to defend his states borders
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,immigration enforcement is a federal authority
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,the agents should sue the administration into oblivion
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,please put all these biden loving traitors in jail im so sick of this administration
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,ive never known a progressive democrat to ever tell the truth
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,being talked down to by heels up harris is disgusting
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,ironic  joe telling others they are doing a poor job
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,biden needs to hold a televised news conference with those border agents and publicly apologize to them for his stupid remarks in front of the entire nation
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,offensive language you mean like when brandon called peter doocy a stupid son of a biotch  lets indict biden for that comment then
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,should be able to sue the hell out every politician and news station that lied defamation
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,our vp even laughs when talking about slavery unreal
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,if biden was pinocchio and his nose was made of wood we would never have a lumber shortage
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,to see the american public treated like they did fuel being cut off inflation raging its outrageous   i promise you those people will pay  yes brandon you should pay
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,when does joe offer an apology personally to these border agents
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,ill say this the immigration enforcement is a federal authority and states should not be mandating it or meddling in it 
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,every single minute of every single day joe just keeps reminding us all how great president trump really is
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,thats our so called leadership leading from the rear once again
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,the vice president shouldnt laugh at moments where she should be serious
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,can that vp go one speech without her signature cackle
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,of course they lied buden and his admins should be ashamed of themselves
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,the duty of a true patriot is to protect his country from its government or president  thomas paine
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,kamala harris laughing talking about indigenous people getting whipped is absolutely infuriating
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,how about not just we were actually wrong how about  we actually lied
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,ill say this that immigration enforcement is a federal authority
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,if evidence disappears mysteriously that doesnt mean the perpetrators are innocent of their crimes
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,if they had to eat crow about everything they wereare wrong about
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,we as american citizens need to finally start standing up against this corruption just like in sri lanka
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,he could have said i was wrong this is a prime example of what happens when we jump to conclusions before the investigation is done
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,how would democrats know they hadnt been anywhere close to the border its ok for them to treat their own people like that and letting people go after federal judges
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,i cant believe our ancestors worked so hard to make this country and they just let it go after everything in the past 100 years
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,this is why gutfeld is so good he completely sums up the hypocrisy perfectly at the end there
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,all hes done is lie since hes been in office how is it this man still breathes fresh air everyday and not in prison
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,love how jessica takes it so lightly just eat crow and move on
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,they lie about everything when are they going to be held accountable
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,the idiocy of this administration is amazing
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,how anyone can sit there on this show and defend anything this administration is doing is just sickening
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,thank god maybe theres hope in this country against this administration
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,if immigration is under federal authority like she says then they should be doing their job so states  dont have to
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,ill give you an example of offensive language the biden administration
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,of course move on after public apologies this agents have to sue this administration
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,its absolutely sad to see the wh treat border patrol treated like criminals and the protesters outside the justices house treated like heroes
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,harris laughs at the weirdest things that clip was so awkward to watch
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,why on earth does that woman insist on laughing when shes voicing allegedly serious concerns
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,the fjb administration as a whole has never riden a horse in their lives
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,i promise you these people will pay  what about you mr biden will you pay for false accusations
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,its not only the message the messager matters too joke bidumb and the token press secretary have no business being anywhere near the levers of power
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,clueless administration says clueless things lets go brandon
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,we need an appology go to those man that were terribly accused by biden and admin kamala too
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,people also forget and fail to mention that the majority of border patrol agents are latinomexican and communicate fluently  respectfully in spanish with the migrants
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,lets focus on the issues at hand that actually matter and are factual this administration is super out of hand
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,this administration and all liberal medianeeds to apologize to all these border patrols live on tv
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,he lies all the time whats new he needs to pay for all the lies hes told
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,a false witness will not go unpunished nor will a liar escape  proverbs 195
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,american workers that actually want to work are the ones that are given hell
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,they woke that man up long enough to tell him what to say on the news and now they throw him under the bus lol devilish people
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,my dad cracked me with a stock whip for mouthing off i wasnt even breaking the law or anything big deal we laugh about it now
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,thank you joey shame on the administration and shame on jessica
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,democrats enjoy miss leading legally show us the leaderships of this usa  republican power of the usa
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,why isnt jessica working at cnn shes certainly got the intelligence for it
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,well when the federal government doesnt protect the border then the states have no choice jean pierre
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,the border agents should sue this administration lets go brandon
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,brandon will never admit he did anything wrong he has no idea of whats going on maybe the ester bunny can have a chat with him
Y8IV-vmsGJ0,interesting that the federal government has no qualms in overstepping where states rights are concerned but if a state looks to its own border security they cry foul ugh

2xVBAqybA_8,maybe i wouldnt have earned a d in chem in high school if she was my teacher
2xVBAqybA_8,i loved science i still remember the periodic table in order haha
2xVBAqybA_8,the reason why we cant pass through each other is not the incredibly dense nucleus of atoms its the strength of the repulsion of the electromagnetic field of electrons primarily
_2jULayKYTs,ive also realised that at the very beginning of the disc it sounds like reversed xp orb sounds
_2jULayKYTs,ancient builder 1 how do we bring back the dead
_2jULayKYTs,how in the hell did matt actually think that was the sound of sirens its a singular creaking noise of a door or something
_2jULayKYTs,the phantom shriek is actually closer to a shrieker
_2jULayKYTs,since the warden can 2 shot a full netherite amoured player the use of resistance potions have more of a use other than pvp
_2jULayKYTs,so mysterious portal lead to hostile dimension
_2jULayKYTs,hey matpat remember the other 12 music discs before 119 9 of them play weird noises andor screaming do you think this might be related to the war

2Yt6raj-S1M,seriously i felt smarter when i was in the elementary school than now
2Yt6raj-S1M,fact we learn more on the internet from travelling and meeting people than we have at school
2Yt6raj-S1M,imagination is more important than knowledge  albert einstein
2Yt6raj-S1M,these creative children have turned into these teenagers who are unwilling to think outside the box
2Yt6raj-S1M,teachers school is your second home
2Yt6raj-S1M,imagine if school actually helped kids find what they are passionate about and then became successful at a young age
2Yt6raj-S1M,the kid
2Yt6raj-S1M,everyone is intelligent but our grades made us idiots
2Yt6raj-S1M,how i learn a language at school
2Yt6raj-S1M,ive learned more about science by my own curiosity and the internet than all 13 years of school
2Yt6raj-S1M,as a student im proud this was on my recommended and i accept this
2Yt6raj-S1M,school is like a torture game you dont work to memorize you work to complete
2Yt6raj-S1M,what parents expect from us during school
2Yt6raj-S1M,school is all about how strong your memory is not how intelligent you are exams tests memory not intelligence
2Yt6raj-S1M,school makes you scared of failing when failing is the only way to truly learn
2Yt6raj-S1M,i want this man as my teacher
2Yt6raj-S1M,job interviewer so why did you wanted to join
2Yt6raj-S1M,i was actually home schooled until i was 10
2Yt6raj-S1M,it is depressing to see how happiness is still only linked to success
2Yt6raj-S1M,noone has ever changed the world by doing what the world has told them to do powerful words i live by that
2Yt6raj-S1M,society moved on  but they forgot the ones who will continue the society  some speech i suddenly remembered
2Yt6raj-S1M,no one has ever changed the world by doing what the world has told them to do  eddy zhong
2Yt6raj-S1M,thank you school for
2Yt6raj-S1M,nothing is more important than imagination not even education he is a legendary person
2Yt6raj-S1M,as a college professor and public school teacher of more than 20 years this kid is dead on everything he said is true
2Yt6raj-S1M,no one has ever changed the world by doing something the world told them to do
2Yt6raj-S1M,my mom just said intelligence is more important than my feelings
2Yt6raj-S1M,instead of teaching us supporting us and cheering us on
2Yt6raj-S1M,school make me feel like grades are more important than the actual education im getting
2Yt6raj-S1M,dont make school your life find that thing youre passionate about dont rely on school or teachers
2Yt6raj-S1M,education is when you learn from your mistakes
2Yt6raj-S1M,no one has ever changed the world by doing what the world told them to do awesome love this
2Yt6raj-S1M,fun fact  students watching this video would think on it for a couple of minutes and continue memorizing their subjects
2Yt6raj-S1M,schools then lets feed edit these childrens curiousity and creativity
2Yt6raj-S1M,school isnt about learning its about passing this is sad
2Yt6raj-S1M,exams are literally obstacles that prevent me from doing what i want to do in my life people think they are useful but in reality they are pointless
2Yt6raj-S1M,when kids go to school they learn things
2Yt6raj-S1M,this is why public schoolers laugh at homeschoolers for being dumb and yet those homeschoolers probably are more happy and successful now
2Yt6raj-S1M,this guy has some amazing points i ageree with legit all his points i plan on writing an essay about these things about the failures of the school system
2Yt6raj-S1M,yes i would love to hear this instead of doing my homework
2Yt6raj-S1M,go to high school
2Yt6raj-S1M,the one ted talk they wont show in class
2Yt6raj-S1M,i loved this so much honestly it made me almost cry because i myself am struggling with deciding my career and limit my options he was speaking facts
2Yt6raj-S1M,we go to school just to get good grades and then forget everything 
2Yt6raj-S1M,im not a geniusim just passionately curiousalbert einstein
2Yt6raj-S1M,i was a 15 year old kid who loved programming and theoretical physics especially theory of relativitytried to understand tensor calculus without even knowing calculus
2Yt6raj-S1M,my friend once said the only thing i learned from school is that life is unfair
2Yt6raj-S1M,no one has ever changed the world by doing what the world told them to do
2Yt6raj-S1M,what an amazing these days i was trying to drop out of school and surprisingly i got this video recommended
2Yt6raj-S1M,anyone who speaks english as a 2nd language learned it from video games and movies none from school
2Yt6raj-S1M,who can actually remember what they learnt in school 3years ago but im very sure you can all remember your inventions even for decade
2Yt6raj-S1M,learning how everything works is more important than learning about failing in life
2Yt6raj-S1M,education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school
2Yt6raj-S1M,i learn more from youtube videos than i learn at school
2Yt6raj-S1M,i like how every school student agrees to this but we just sit around waiting for others to do something about it then people dont drop that habit till adulthood
2Yt6raj-S1M,i love this video ive been saying exactly the same stuff and everyone doubts me and says im wrong
2Yt6raj-S1M,no one has ever changed the world by doing what the world has told them to do
2Yt6raj-S1M,noone has ever changed the world by doing what the world has told them to do  eddy zhong
2Yt6raj-S1M,this is one of the most practical and brilliant talks on tedx 
2Yt6raj-S1M,people who have changed the world did not do what the world told them
2Yt6raj-S1M,eddys words have actually been proven right a new survey says the average american uses just 37 percent of the information they learn in school
2Yt6raj-S1M,a lot of wisdom for such a young man great work eddy
2Yt6raj-S1M,this was true for my undergrad and graduate degrees i learned more by myself online than i did from my profs and their notes
2Yt6raj-S1M,im a straight a student and the school system is so screwed and useless ive learned more from the internet and youtube than school
2Yt6raj-S1M,i often have ds and cs but my classmates know im the one to go to for help
2Yt6raj-S1M,right when he said the word creating my ears perked up i can relate with this like crazy
2Yt6raj-S1M,no one has ever changed the world by doing what the world has told them to do
2Yt6raj-S1M,an inspiring young man with an inspiring message
2Yt6raj-S1M,very inspiring speech one of the best ive found on ted talk
2Yt6raj-S1M,dont worryyoure not the only one who is asian doesnt understand math
2Yt6raj-S1M,hopefully this video like me has inspired you to continue being you prosper in your choices and ultimately succeed
2Yt6raj-S1M,no one has ever changed the world by doing what the
2Yt6raj-S1M,good grades dont measure your intelligence it just measures how often you turn in your homework
T4PFt4czJw0,this man sacrificed his body for science not gonna lie hes successfully horrified me into wanting to clean up my diet
T4PFt4czJw0,im not enjoying it but i cant stop
T4PFt4czJw0,at 19stone over 5 weeks ago this looks exactly like how i used to eat
T4PFt4czJw0,doc im not enjoying it but i cant stop
T4PFt4czJw0,it would have been good to see how he struggled to reacclimate to his healthier diet again
T4PFt4czJw0,commendable doc thanks for doing a real experiment and putting it up for us to see what needs to change
T4PFt4czJw0,i would love to see him getting back on track with his diet and what hes eaten and how it affects his brain and hormones
T4PFt4czJw0,its hilarious watching a middle class man describe fried chicken to his family like its an alien artefact
T4PFt4czJw0,this make me feel so much better i always knew i was addicted to food coz of a lifetime of bad eating starting with my parents being poor
T4PFt4czJw0,fortunately here in hong kong processed foods are more expensive than fresh
T4PFt4czJw0,lived like this in college 3 years ago i could physically feel my body scream for healthier home cooked meals i dont do fast foods anymore
T4PFt4czJw0,love the honesty so refreshing to see a normal family honesty about how most of us eat and unscripted
T4PFt4czJw0,i like how the doctor wasnt pretentious at all about the food and had a non biased opinion
T4PFt4czJw0,i really appreciate the fact that this guy let the bones empty when was eating  the crispy  stuff well done
T4PFt4czJw0,this is like a much more scientific version of supersize me and i love it really opens your eyes to how bad processed foods can be
T4PFt4czJw0,i think these kind of practical videos should be displayed to kids at school im sure it would bring some awareness and change from young age
T4PFt4czJw0,i literally could not agree with him more about cereal like coco pops theyre outrageously good
T4PFt4czJw0,uk doctor switches to standard american diet haha only kidding
T4PFt4czJw0,this is really eyeopening stuff great video certainly has changed how i feel about my diet
T4PFt4czJw0,im not enjoying it but i cant stop
T4PFt4czJw0,fascinating another great show from dr chris thank you
T4PFt4czJw0,this needs to be seen and understood by everyone in the country
T4PFt4czJw0,so so informative and the part about the new pathways in the brain is really helpful for me thanks
T4PFt4czJw0,this is
T4PFt4czJw0,im not enjoying it but i cant stop is spot on

PYvubMlbWrc,i cant believe we have to deal with 3 more years of bob paycheck
PYvubMlbWrc,so disappointed that the high speed rail wont be connecting to disney world and even more disappointed that were stuck with chapek for 3 more years
PYvubMlbWrc,i love how aj was practically whispering the news about chapek like maybe people just wont hear this part
PYvubMlbWrc,as someone who moved to central florida in 2022 it is quite infuriating that they wont sell annual passes
PYvubMlbWrc,finally my weekend morning tradition has resurfaced  you had me worried when it didnt appear yesterday
PYvubMlbWrc,bob weathered the storm of the pandemic for the company by taking it out of the fans i cant say i am surprised that they would keep him just disappointed
PYvubMlbWrc,so impressed that you were able to get this video done while disembarking the disney wish your dedication to this channel is incredible
PYvubMlbWrc,great updates my family and i are going to disney in two weekswe are looking forward to our trip your videos make it even more exciting
PYvubMlbWrc,they can call it whatever they want but it will still be splash mountain for me and many others
PYvubMlbWrc,even though i cant afford or have the time to visit disney world  i like seeing more content uploaded
PYvubMlbWrc,thanks aj i
PYvubMlbWrc,i love all the dfb videos keep up the good work you are appreciated by us all
PYvubMlbWrc,im so disappointed theyre keeping chapek glad we finally have a name announced for the splash mountain refurb though
PYvubMlbWrc,seeing everyone up in arms about the state of the disney parks makes me think of a line from into the woods
PYvubMlbWrc,love princess and the frog and cant wait for the ride i just wish it wasnt replacing my all time favorite ride in disney world 
PYvubMlbWrc,aj has always you and your team always spot on for the update news videos an on the news letter as always love and respect to u an your team
PYvubMlbWrc,yay didnt realize i was so attached to the latest news vidsdont it always seem to go that you dont know what youve got til its gone
PYvubMlbWrc,hopefully splash mountain closes later in 2023 my family finally got a trip booked for next may and itd be my last chance to ride splash mountain
PYvubMlbWrc,i still cant believe they are changing a great ride when theres so many other rides that need to be fixed
PYvubMlbWrc,cant wait for the wish vlogs  very excited
PYvubMlbWrc,cant wait to take that cruise
PYvubMlbWrc,do you think they named it tianas bayou adventure because its still tba
PYvubMlbWrc,im sitting here laughing my head off because i thought you said the new narrator was borat and i just accepted it but thought it was an odd choice
PYvubMlbWrc,according to the comments i wasnt the only one very lost without the news
PYvubMlbWrc,watching dfb guide to prepare for our disney world 2023 trip you cant go wrong
PYvubMlbWrc,bob raising prices so he can pocket more fat compensation vote no on compensation packages shareholders
PYvubMlbWrc,i honestly thought it would be alright to keep the name splash mountain
PYvubMlbWrc,fully understand why they are removing the name splash mountain as there are no mountains in new orleans or florida
PYvubMlbWrc,are the limited bands the new rechargeable ones
PYvubMlbWrc,hi aj do you know what time very merry tickets go on sale on july 7th i read the news letter but no time was on there
PYvubMlbWrc,any idea when disney will pay their stockholders dividends again
PYvubMlbWrc,wow completely ridiculous they are canceling the train from the airport huge opportunity missed for all europeans coming to disney
PYvubMlbWrc,thank god
PYvubMlbWrc,as a disneytrained travel agent hearing that chapek received an extension on his contract makes me want to vomit
PYvubMlbWrc,i have not seen  a vid posted on sunday before thanks aj you rock
PYvubMlbWrc,i can believe bobby paycheck got a few more years hes nickeled and dimed guests since re open all about that profit
PYvubMlbWrc,hooray for celebrating orange bird again
PYvubMlbWrc,bob paycheck needs to go i see no improvements under his realm just negative vibes i also believe he doesnt care about the cms just his own economic interests
PYvubMlbWrc,how do you guys even afford to do everything disney its so expensive 00
PYvubMlbWrc,the people commenting on chapek dont realize how many new rides and lands he is responsible for

wdG7OIEMvXo,awesome win red sox nick didnt have his best stuff though but it happens hats off to the bullpen for keeping it close ill take the split
wdG7OIEMvXo,to split the series with the best team in the mlb is respectable go sox
wdG7OIEMvXo,jeter demolishing the yankees 2 games in a row
wdG7OIEMvXo,i love the batting from the red sox but that pitching has been underwhelming all season
wdG7OIEMvXo,just a nice comeback win  everyone did something  to top it offthose two plays by downs in the ninth were outstanding
wdG7OIEMvXo,what an awesome comeback win for alex cora and the red sox
wdG7OIEMvXo,its amazing how chapman is still hurling the ball in triple digit speeds
wdG7OIEMvXo,heck of a comeback to come back yanks seen a few holes needing addressed  besides staying at home in the playoffsnice soxs fight back
wdG7OIEMvXo,the typical espn yankee lovefest turned into a yankee meltdown
wdG7OIEMvXo,great comeback win red sox
wdG7OIEMvXo,great to see jd go yard hopefully this starts a good streak for him
wdG7OIEMvXo,red sox yankees games are always a blast to watch
wdG7OIEMvXo,1 pivetta sticked it through with cuts and bruises too
wdG7OIEMvXo,its nice to see the jv red sox split a series with the juggernaut yankees
wdG7OIEMvXo,vamos red sox lest go
wdG7OIEMvXo,con este juego queda claro q boston es uno de los mas poderosos team este aoindiscutible
wdG7OIEMvXo,it was like a playoff game
wdG7OIEMvXo,these last 2 games seem like they saved season for red sox
wdG7OIEMvXo,i cant believe in my eyes we lost this bad especially when we have the considerable early lead
wdG7OIEMvXo,no es como se empieza sino como se termina lol
wdG7OIEMvXo,what a great series nice to have sox vs yanks exciting again
wdG7OIEMvXo,como me lo disfrut
wdG7OIEMvXo,another great game today im looking forward to the new york yankees vs boston red sox yankee stadium i wonder what the outcome will be
wdG7OIEMvXo,what an awesome battle itll be this year for ny boston and houston to make the ws lets go yankees from new zealand
wdG7OIEMvXo,red sox season just turned for the better and i now think the yankees have some doubts
wdG7OIEMvXo,i had the red sox 5 first 5 innings
wdG7OIEMvXo,its not quite a series win vs an al opponent but its an improvement
wdG7OIEMvXo,good to see trevor story hitting good again and fielding
wdG7OIEMvXo,meanwhile rafael has to be happy and mad at the same when a few of his teammates tore it up 
wdG7OIEMvXo,all i saw was chaos and destruction  yankees you got creamed and owned
wdG7OIEMvXo,lets gooooo red sox huge w
wdG7OIEMvXo,all of the yankees weaknesses were exposed these last 2 games
wdG7OIEMvXo,obviously the rivalry game is difficult regardless of the winning streak or losing streak
wdG7OIEMvXo,i always enjoy getting to see the yankees lose
wdG7OIEMvXo,not bad considering it was the woosox starting rotation vs the best rotation in mlb
wdG7OIEMvXo,jeter helping to beat the yankees    what universe is this
wdG7OIEMvXo,wait until we get sale and eovaldi back we will be a force
wdG7OIEMvXo,it might not happen as much these days but still i smile everytime the yankees lose
wdG7OIEMvXo,the boston red sox are 4739
wdG7OIEMvXo,another victory for the red sox within five runs over the yankees
wdG7OIEMvXo,way to go red sox
wdG7OIEMvXo,i never thought jeter would kill the yankees so much lol
wdG7OIEMvXo,mlb juiced those balls for this series thats for damn sure
wdG7OIEMvXo,ggs on the split sox
wdG7OIEMvXo,of course this happened when i stopped watching when it was 40 of course the red sox just play better when i turn the game off lmao
wdG7OIEMvXo,good comeback win by the red sox
wdG7OIEMvXo,watched this on espn might get me back into baseball really entertaining all around
wdG7OIEMvXo,yanks fans are gonna call for boone to be fired already
wdG7OIEMvXo,the people want a dodgersastros world series rematch
wdG7OIEMvXo,its honestly hilarious watching yankees fans try to act like theyre the best fan base in baseball
wdG7OIEMvXo,sick love to see the yankees pitching imploding all over lets keep it up boys start a good streak of some 7 era ball
wdG7OIEMvXo,if i have a chance i want to watch the game at the new york yankees vs boston red sox stadium
wdG7OIEMvXo,never ceases to amaze us how badly the yankees choke
wdG7OIEMvXo,good game
wdG7OIEMvXo,sawamura got a gift but boy was he dealing tonight i hope he builds off this
wdG7OIEMvXo,red sox aaarookie pitching staff  yankees overrated pitching staff
wdG7OIEMvXo,stanton is a top 5 guy i love to watch
wdG7OIEMvXo,lets go that how we do it
wdG7OIEMvXo,sorry for another comment but the red sox are close to getting their pictures back very happy we split the series with only one starting pitcher basically
wdG7OIEMvXo,the yankees deserve that lose for sitting gallo
wdG7OIEMvXo,i love it when the yankees  lose
wdG7OIEMvXo,we spanked the stankees again the stankees have a 2 game losing streak those are facts go sox
wdG7OIEMvXo,i guess 422 after a four run lead
wdG7OIEMvXo,great win 
wdG7OIEMvXo,just got home from this game lmao super electric
wdG7OIEMvXo,another game yankees still dont know how they lost xd taillon giving too much runs
wdG7OIEMvXo,thanks lemahieu
wdG7OIEMvXo,yankees playing sloppy i see a rough next few weeks in their future
wdG7OIEMvXo,i hope the yankees bounce back next series these last 2 games were painful to watch
wdG7OIEMvXo,how ironic that a guy named jeter owned the yankees this weekend
wdG7OIEMvXo,funny how carpenter did real good today trevino had a decent day but everyone else could not hit yankees are flat out embarrassing sometimes
wdG7OIEMvXo,aaron judge cant hit in fenway lmao
wdG7OIEMvXo,what happened yankee fans i thought you said you would sweep the red sox
wdG7OIEMvXo,stanton always looks like he wants to fight someone dude is on steroids and its so obvious
wdG7OIEMvXo,to be fair it is stanton consider it a challenge for a good hitter to not be scared when the balls a tiny bit inside
wdG7OIEMvXo,section 23 row 7 seat 13 great game
wdG7OIEMvXo,yankees really lost to the red sox rookies and aaa players lmao
wdG7OIEMvXo,great game and im a yankee fan but i love watching these two teams play very competitive games its great
wdG7OIEMvXo,estamos jugando mal no podemos dejar ir ventajas

uFgqVRC_Xzs,the tip for practicing with minimal waste is brilliant makes me feel brave enough to try latte art again thank you
uFgqVRC_Xzs,oh man i would be sooooo pleased if i can do latte failed art like you did in the beginning
uFgqVRC_Xzs,your here because your latte art looks more like this
uFgqVRC_Xzs,it seems like he struggled for to do it wrong its very difficult to him to do it wrong d
uFgqVRC_Xzs,im actually flattered that you think my latte art looks like those disasters in the beginning
uFgqVRC_Xzs,the last tip is really nice
uFgqVRC_Xzs,thank you for the tips mistake 4 for me is so hard to adjust i always pour so slow fearing itll overflow
uFgqVRC_Xzs,great tips thanks for the video
uFgqVRC_Xzs,this is amazing so helpful and brings such clarity i find its really difficult to do latte art in take away cups
uFgqVRC_Xzs,great tutorial
uFgqVRC_Xzs,love the bonus tip i dont know how many nights of sleep i had to lose just for the sake of practicing latte art
uFgqVRC_Xzs,really helpful tips clear and simple thank you so much
uFgqVRC_Xzs,the excitement i felt when you gave the bonus tip for practising oh my word trying it out today d
uFgqVRC_Xzs,you can also practice with soapy water aerated from a 5 milk frother pouring into a couple ounces of water mixed with cheap nescafe
uFgqVRC_Xzs,awesome videos the content is really well produced and thought out all the best with the channel
uFgqVRC_Xzs,thank you so much for the last tip my biggest failure is my latte art is nonsymmetrical i have to practice till i perfect it 
uFgqVRC_Xzs,that was great i really appreciate the bonus tip as that is what will really get me the practice i need cheers
uFgqVRC_Xzs,nice practise tip love the mocha i heard you can use a little liquid soap into water as well or is that just the milk texturing practise
uFgqVRC_Xzs,great video thank you i realized what ive been doing wrong most of the time pulling through too fast
uFgqVRC_Xzs,great tip with the chocolate at the end ill certainly be trying this and practicing more during quiet spells now
uFgqVRC_Xzs,first i went like 
uFgqVRC_Xzs,such an amazing video my problem was mainly pouring too fast and pulling away too muchfast love the tips will try again
uFgqVRC_Xzs,great post love to see more about latte art and connect with people who love to practice
uFgqVRC_Xzs,great tips thank you for sharing your knowledge with us
uFgqVRC_Xzs,great video paul im new to the barista career i mastered the texture in first week and speed latte art is why im here
uFgqVRC_Xzs,im definitely going to try the last one no more waiting days between practice
uFgqVRC_Xzs,this is a quality lesson thank you
uFgqVRC_Xzs,my biggest problem with latte art is my milk isnt thick enough and the next time its to thick 
uFgqVRC_Xzs,basically i make everything wrong  the last tip for reusing coffee to practice the latte art is amazing thank you
uFgqVRC_Xzs,i love how even after trying to make it bad his latte art still looks amazing
uFgqVRC_Xzs,thumbs up for the super useful bonus tip literally save lots of coffee and milk thank you
uFgqVRC_Xzs,this what i need  such a useful video for a beginner like me thank you so much
uFgqVRC_Xzs,timas dicas meu maior problema  ainda no ter a jarra e tambm achar o ponto do leite continuo testando
uFgqVRC_Xzs,thanks for the bonus tip now in can finally practice more than once a day
uFgqVRC_Xzs,great video series
uFgqVRC_Xzs,ive tried and tried for that last line and no one has explained it that well before
uFgqVRC_Xzs,great value in the video texture is the first thing to focus on you can practice steaming with a jug of water and a droplet of dish soap
uFgqVRC_Xzs,another thing to mention is you are using a sweet jug with a beautiful pouring spout that helps really improve things
uFgqVRC_Xzs,getting the milk texture right is my issue using a plunger it at times gets thick or too many bubbles
uFgqVRC_Xzs,that one where you just scooped out the foam and threw the equipment
uFgqVRC_Xzs,some of the fails at the start of the video made me think of those infomercial people who do something outrageously wrong but yet relate to
uFgqVRC_Xzs,the bonus was even better than the whole tips helps with practicing a lot
uFgqVRC_Xzs,while my fails dont look nearly as good as your first 2 fails they definitely look better than your last 2
uFgqVRC_Xzs,coffee can smell your fear i like that
uFgqVRC_Xzs,yup did all those mistakes
uFgqVRC_Xzs,im starting my barista journey now taking a master barista class this is really exciting times
uFgqVRC_Xzs,i just started training as a barista for a start up coffee shop and my biggest failure is never getting my milk the right consistency
uFgqVRC_Xzs,mine would be pouring too fast and getting a white top
uFgqVRC_Xzs,given that only the last 3 examples of failure you showed apply to me i would be thrilled to fail like the first example i would take that any day
uFgqVRC_Xzs,thanks this is the most helpful video on this yet  i like the final tip on saving  milk
uFgqVRC_Xzs,lol glad im not the only one who clearly went  when seeing his first failed art attempts ahahah those last few ones are definitely more accurate 
uFgqVRC_Xzs,woooow that tip at the end though well all of the tips were great but adding the chocolate so you can keep practicing and not wasting is genius
uFgqVRC_Xzs,when you want to make a mistake but cant because you are good in making a coffee d
uFgqVRC_Xzs,lol mine was the one where i just scooped the foam in at the end with a spoon
uFgqVRC_Xzs,very informative and lovely results  cant wait for my espresso auto grinder to arrive
uFgqVRC_Xzs,my first latte art was heart and after rosetta
uFgqVRC_Xzs,i love the tip at the end now i can practice without wasting coffee and milk
uFgqVRC_Xzs,i felt attacked in the beginning
uFgqVRC_Xzs,fantastic tips  going to immediately try these  thank you very much   do you find that the spout pointynessof the frothing pitcher makes a difference
uFgqVRC_Xzs,i found out that holding the jug by the rim gives me more control and also gives me the indication of milk temperature
uFgqVRC_Xzs,im just starting out
uFgqVRC_Xzs,great tips thanks what about the qty of coffee single vs double shot
uFgqVRC_Xzs,amazing last tip i used water with soap but this is closer to the real deal subbed
uFgqVRC_Xzs,great tip for practicing  i was thinking how much i would waste practicing
uFgqVRC_Xzs,still struggling with milk texture but well get there
uFgqVRC_Xzs,if thats ur failurethen its so cool actually
uFgqVRC_Xzs,best tips ive ever seen even after being trained in a coffee house
uFgqVRC_Xzs,cool tip for practice thank you

LTurbnNO44c,rasheed wallace voice both teams played hard my man

LTurbnNO44c,hopefully hayes can step up this year
LTurbnNO44c,i love the effort blazers put on despite sharpes injury walker could be a steal especially for his defensive skills
LTurbnNO44c,man duren had me hype the 12 mins he played what a trio cade ivey and duren could be
LTurbnNO44c,you know youve got a star when sportscenters game highlights are only jaden ivey go pistons
LTurbnNO44c,detroit pistons have some young exciting players on their roster ivey and duren could be an explosive tandem for years to come
LTurbnNO44c,ivey  duren great chemistry
LTurbnNO44c,both teams played well i love it
LTurbnNO44c,i dont think sharpe wanna play
LTurbnNO44c,the referees in the summer league are so brutal they really take away from the game but damn this got me excited for the future of my detroit pistons
LTurbnNO44c,shadeon sharpe getting hurt 6 minutes into the game we needed to see more of him
LTurbnNO44c,man ivey and duren are gonna be so damn good lmao
LTurbnNO44c,pistons starting line up is scary motorcade poison ivey bey beef stew and duden heads will roll
LTurbnNO44c,im happy for garza but really i want him stay at detroit
LTurbnNO44c,as pistons fan its really good to see garza back out there already wish we could kept him
LTurbnNO44c,detroit might be really interesting this year i know its just a summer league game but these young guys are gonna be awesome to watch
LTurbnNO44c,knew ivey was gonna be tuff when i saw his college highlights
LTurbnNO44c,i know its summer league and all but this pistons roster could be very scary
LTurbnNO44c,jaden ivey summer league debut 
LTurbnNO44c,both teams had play good but the pistons look scary

LTurbnNO44c,love the summer league so much under the table talent we get too see without the superstars

LTurbnNO44c,ivey coming for that roty
LTurbnNO44c,these duren summer league highlights gonna have me thinking hes kg pistons back baby
LTurbnNO44c,pistons will be a exciting team to watch hopefully more run n gun fast pace
LTurbnNO44c,once the season starts these younger teams such as the rockets and thunder will be a lot of fun to watch cant wait for it to start
LTurbnNO44c,ive been saying it and i stand on it ivey will be the best player in this draft class
LTurbnNO44c,i was hoping cade would play too hope one of these early summer games well see some ivey and cade
LTurbnNO44c,enjoyed that game ivey is definitely going to make some noise in the nba
LTurbnNO44c,i was a fan of livers when he was playing for michigan and i think he is far underrated
LTurbnNO44c,isaiah livers and keon johnson also had an awsome performance
LTurbnNO44c,really exciting to see is making 3s
LTurbnNO44c,we all have to give luka garza some credit he proved that he was worth at least something playing against his former team
LTurbnNO44c,ivey will be the best player in this draft mark my words
LTurbnNO44c,cannot wait to see ivey and cunningham play in the same backcourt together pistons lowkey scary if they can put it together
LTurbnNO44c,loved the effort at the end by my blazers
LTurbnNO44c,my pistons are ready for any team this year
LTurbnNO44c,ivey is gonna be nice man detroit you got a winner man
LTurbnNO44c,cadebeyiveyduren and stewart

LTurbnNO44c,jaden ivey remember the name hes going to ball out in his rookie debut with the detroit pistons
LTurbnNO44c,okc is insane for not taking jaden ivey he was an easy 1 id taken ivey durenmark williams jalen williams blake wesley and maybe a wendell moore jrchristian braun
LTurbnNO44c,lovin how my young pistons lookin
LTurbnNO44c,i love the way ivey plays basketball
LTurbnNO44c,pistons thunder and pelicans all of them have bright futures
LTurbnNO44c,sharpe getting hurt is most blazers thing ever
LTurbnNO44c,so damn ready for the season
LTurbnNO44c,im convinced shaedon is ducking
LTurbnNO44c,restore detroit basketball
LTurbnNO44c,ivey the real deal duran is alley oop ready and stewart hitting 3s detroit scary hours
LTurbnNO44c,why was he mad at the end of the game missed dunk they needed a 3 lol
LTurbnNO44c,hope they continue to underestimate beef stews 3 point shooting
LTurbnNO44c,pistons looking really good juz need a leader to lead these youngcore
LTurbnNO44c,jaden ivey is the next star
LTurbnNO44c,prayers to shaedon sharpe hopefully the injury isnt serious
LTurbnNO44c,pistons looking good
LTurbnNO44c,that put back dunk attempt to tie the game at the end should have just tapped it

sl61lHwo3YE,very easy to recreate at home affordable as well
sl61lHwo3YE,linus 2022 we may never see performance like this again in our lifetime
sl61lHwo3YE,every time linus moves a part i sweat bullets lol
sl61lHwo3YE,i love when people are genuinely excited about their passion like this its amazing
sl61lHwo3YE,i hold my breath every time linus is holding things
sl61lHwo3YE,im super jacked for this series cant wait to see it going all together and up and running freaking awesome
sl61lHwo3YE,im so excited for the part where he has his editors use it and respond with yeah its ok
sl61lHwo3YE,i can already tell that this is going to be my favorite series on this channel
sl61lHwo3YE,i can just imagine the folks and nvidia and kioxia covering their faces in fear as linus handles their 1000000 worth of hardware in such a care free way lmao
sl61lHwo3YE,looking forward to seeing the rest of this series  incredible looking hardware hope it performs as well as it looks
sl61lHwo3YE,building a data center is the most expensive part about building a data center
sl61lHwo3YE,i recognize that mellanox gear  its been a few years since i was using this stuff i didnt know that nvidia had acquired them
sl61lHwo3YE,love to see more serverenterprise gear show up on this channel again
sl61lHwo3YE,i love that kioxia said challenge accepted they werent  thats not we were thinking or heres a script for this but thats an interesting engineering project
sl61lHwo3YE,i would feel like a kid going to disney for the first time if i were to receive such an amount of enterprise hardware at home this is amazing
sl61lHwo3YE,i start sweating every time they let just linus hold a part from one of these his track record with holding things isdubious at best
sl61lHwo3YE,the modularity of that hardware is wonderful and i hope we get some of that sort of thing in lowerenddiy servers in the future
sl61lHwo3YE,these guys can pump out actually insane content all week it is amazing
sl61lHwo3YE,im super curious about what youve got planned for all that gpu compute
sl61lHwo3YE,when linus and jake cant actually believe what it is theyre looking at even though they already know whats coming you know its going to be something special
sl61lHwo3YE,finally a proper hpc hardware stack the setup seems to be specialized for ai training but imagenet might be too small for a proper benchmark
sl61lHwo3YE,im really excited to see the rest of this the more information on server builds the better even outlandish server builds like this one
sl61lHwo3YE,thank you for the tech tip linus i cant wait to install this in my home
sl61lHwo3YE,i was thinking of upgrading my 400 dollar pc this seems like a good option to go with thanks linus
sl61lHwo3YE,kioxia was like that sounds like fun lets make this happen
sl61lHwo3YE,i love that linus has a pull out animation for the screwdriver every time he takes it out he flips it
sl61lHwo3YE,thank you kioxia for doing this i cant wait for the rest of the seriess super cool
sl61lHwo3YE,well this might partially explain supermicros current really long lead times on servers
sl61lHwo3YE,as a datacenter technician i find it very cute how you are excited so much about such small things d
sl61lHwo3YE,i love when linus is excited because he starts creating new words to describe things
sl61lHwo3YE,linus we may never see this again in our lifetime
sl61lHwo3YE,glad we finally get to see why theres a chip shortage  worth
sl61lHwo3YE,i would love a full info guide on how this all works im so interested
sl61lHwo3YE,great video i respect the companies involved in this
sl61lHwo3YE,man i love server  enterprise content this is next level
sl61lHwo3YE,i absolutely love watching linus jake and the team act like children on christmas morning over this ludicrous hardware
sl61lHwo3YE,i wanna see you guys have a server room set and keep the enterprise equipment coming
sl61lHwo3YE,love this so much this is my third time watching cant wait for the rest of the videos this is going to be fun
sl61lHwo3YE,theyre lucky to play with such hardware the best yes
sl61lHwo3YE,this is the coolest thing ive seen cant wait to see it all together
sl61lHwo3YE,the amount of times jake hands linus a piece of hardware then says dont drop this is priceless
sl61lHwo3YE,honestly the best part of this is kioxia playing ball yeah that would be an interesting engineering challenge this is the kind of stuff you like to see
sl61lHwo3YE,damn this is a huge project i cant believe the team pulled this off as a sponsor
sl61lHwo3YE,i understand the feeling i just deployed a 4 node cluster in a 2u box 2tb of ram and 512 cores 1024 threads its crazy
sl61lHwo3YE,grats guys youve been awarded 2022s nerdiest giggles over hardware title the excitement is real in this one
sl61lHwo3YE,alternate title two idiots stack heavy things as high as they possibly can on top of unstable boxes for no good reason
sl61lHwo3YE,i handle mostly cloud servers these days but watching this video made me miss the ol data centres i use to visit for work
sl61lHwo3YE,cant wait for the time when all of this server can fit in a mini itx  case
sl61lHwo3YE,i love how lmg linked everything they used in the description like the viewers would just snag some of it for themselves
sl61lHwo3YE,never been into servers but this thing is a thing of beauty and powerim shocked they let linus anywhere near it with his habit of dropping expensive andor important items
sl61lHwo3YE,havent seen linus this excited in years d like a kid with a new toy
sl61lHwo3YE,daaaammmmmm  i love when companies accept challenges and complete them now m super pumped for the benchmarks 
sl61lHwo3YE,this looks fun insanely top end hardware custom built to reach levels that simply didnt exist before
sl61lHwo3YE,gotta hand it to kioxia they really have some pull in the industry and they went in this full send
sl61lHwo3YE,in my opinion games have needed servers this powerful for years a few racks of these in the right places could potentially transform the competitive gaming industry and mmo spaces
sl61lHwo3YE,serviced nvidia dgxs at my previous job  insane piece of equipment
sl61lHwo3YE,512 cores
sl61lHwo3YE,totally geeking out  can not wait to see all of this content

sl61lHwo3YE,that is fuking insane its cool to see nvidia and amd playing so nicely
sl61lHwo3YE,enterprise storage gear is bonkers ive deployed some multimillion dollar solutions but i dont think ive ever had my hands on anything with that much potential performance
sl61lHwo3YE,funny how it goes i was quite wary of jake in the beginning and in the meantime he has become one of my favorites on ltt
sl61lHwo3YE,holy cow im stoked to learn about this stuff on the million dollar level
sl61lHwo3YE,i really need a shortcircuit explaining how all of this connects between each parts i thought servers were just powerful computers
sl61lHwo3YE,i would start using the server for deep learningai stuff to be honest
sl61lHwo3YE,imagine converting all the ssd storage into virtual storage you would have an insane amount of ram and virtual ram
sl61lHwo3YE,everyone you can possibly name in the server space  rip intel

Np8K4yUou4s,can we all appreciate the fact that sonny never disappointed us with his content
Np8K4yUou4s,theres never a dull moment watching sonnys channels what a gift that is in itself he truly enjoys doing these shows and his joy is so palpable
Np8K4yUou4s,i traveled in thailand and the street food is by far the best in the world its so fresh and its also bloody cheap plus the people are amazing

Np8K4yUou4s,so many options at the cheap one would be hard not to visit everyday if you lived near it
Np8K4yUou4s,i love when sonny says he didnt know ireland had oysters
Np8K4yUou4s,83 is definitely not the most expensive buffet
Np8K4yUou4s,more buffets in different countries would be so cool this video is awesome
