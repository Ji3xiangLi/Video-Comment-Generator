oyClS3qQV10,somehow i never get tired of seeing linus face in all kinds of weird stretches and places
oyClS3qQV10,its cool to see more solid amd laptops pop up now both for the cpu  the gpu
oyClS3qQV10,i really like how you opened it up to take a look at the reparability would like to see more of this in other laptop reviews
oyClS3qQV10,i really liked that you took it apart that is actually extremely helpful
oyClS3qQV10,i was hoping thatd manage to squeeze in another sodimm slot  theyre usually stacked in laptops as it is
oyClS3qQV10,gaming laptops are getting better and better
oyClS3qQV10,the review was good but the delivery was underwhelmingproving how its always good to be passionate about the content you deliver
oyClS3qQV10,the g14 its been the standard for gaming laptops since 2020 i have one since launch and still delivering blasting fast performance
oyClS3qQV10,i wish an outlet would review the 1649 rx 6700s model thats actually available now in the us
oyClS3qQV10,im in love with the monitor hinge lifting it up for airflow
oyClS3qQV10,you guys killed the coverage on this laptop  first on the tubes w a video that had the highlights and this full review was worth the wait
oyClS3qQV10,i have purchased the slightly lower end model with a amd 6700s and i will say its absolutely amazing
oyClS3qQV10,really hoping you guys can cover the alienware x14 and see how that compares against this since that one uses intel instead of amd
oyClS3qQV10,ive been waiting a long time to replace my sony vaio 2010
oyClS3qQV10,i had bought the 2019 model and my biggest regret was not getting the 15 inch model
oyClS3qQV10,interior appearance reminds me of my old vaio s14 only not with ivy bridge and kepler nice to see an antiglare screen on it rather than some stupid touchscreen thing
oyClS3qQV10,i like the additional repairability segment of these reviews
oyClS3qQV10,would love to see a price and gaming comparision to the g15
oyClS3qQV10,i was just thinking about swapping my huge triple monitor gaming setup for a laptop and external monitor with how inflated gpu prices are this might be the one
oyClS3qQV10,i have the base model and i think its a steal getting all the qol upgrades of the maxed out version with a limited hit to most performance
oyClS3qQV10,i have the 2021 edition and i absolutely love it the cooling is really good it looks absolutely amazing and the cocnept of lag doesnt exist anymore for me
oyClS3qQV10,this is all great but i wish they offered an nvidia option cuda is a must for many nongaming workloads
oyClS3qQV10,the g14 is such a good laptop love my model to bits
oyClS3qQV10,you know a laptop is good or turbo sad when alexs coverage of it comes to the main channel
oyClS3qQV10,thank you so much for testing usb4 i hope it supports at least dual 4k60 as ive been running with intel for the last 5 years
oyClS3qQV10,i would like to see a deeper dive into what thunderbolt devices work did you try both sites and more about usb 4 and thunderbolt and the compatibility
oyClS3qQV10,i have last years g14 model and i love it personally it fits all my gaming needs and helps with all my cad photoshop editing work for school
oyClS3qQV10,i loved the cheeto test it was hilarious and informative i would have dismissed this purely for being white otherwise i didnt think it could be done
oyClS3qQV10,the quality of this review was sick a lot of valuable information
oyClS3qQV10,i picked up last years model and its great tbh the 5800hs in mine is a beast love the qhd 120hz display too
oyClS3qQV10,you guys should do a vivobook pro review it was quietly announced but so much potential with almost the same specs as the g14 but with an oled display
oyClS3qQV10,is it really a gaming laptop at 14 i used to have a dell 15 and its amazing the difference it makes swapping to 17
oyClS3qQV10,dang it linus i have had this laptop on my wish list for a while now
oyClS3qQV10,i would love to see this compared to the razer blade 14 2022
oyClS3qQV10,might be something to look into in half a yeararound christmas when they start clearing stock and prices go down
oyClS3qQV10,fyi my razer thunderbolt 4 dock works perfectly with the lenovo thinkpad g14 with the ryzen 5500u so it could work with the zephyrus g14 as well
oyClS3qQV10,about the screw markings fun fact asus used to do that at least 10 years ago on my n53sv
oyClS3qQV10,i love my asus zephyrus and honestly  for the price so worth it engineers wet dream
oyClS3qQV10,as a owner of the 2020 g14 my only complaint about this years model is why did they go away from nvidia
oyClS3qQV10,the zephyrus g15 is the same price in the uk 2k with a 3070ti but only 16gb ram think that might be the better bet
oyClS3qQV10,so can you make top 3  laptops under 1000 cad  i mean one for workediting one for gaming and one just overall killer for the money 
oyClS3qQV10,alex i will wear an esd bracelet
oyClS3qQV10,can amd or intel make their igpu overclockable that way laptop manufacturer can put beefysmart cooling solution on their laptop and have decent gaming experience
oyClS3qQV10,dang i have last years version and now im wishing i waited until this year to upgrade that trackpad looks great
oyClS3qQV10,i just love watching reviews from you guys
oyClS3qQV10,you can turn off the gpu on armoury crate on the system configuration tab  and theres 3 mode on mshybrid mode and select battery savr and youre ready to go
oyClS3qQV10,is  is that an led display on the back i dont even have individually lit pixels on my tv or any of the monitors i own
oyClS3qQV10,with a grate laptop comes great responsibility
oyClS3qQV10,honestly i wonder if testing out thunderbolt docks with ports on the laptops yall receive might be a great addition to the site youre already building for cable testing
oyClS3qQV10,lets take a moment to appreciate how much effort he puts into his content to entertain us
oyClS3qQV10,yeah not worth no where near 2500 the white keyboard in direct light makes it difficult to see the key letteringnumbering

TUN2aaMgozM,de gea is helpless watching the hopeless gary neville during commentary being brutally honest
TUN2aaMgozM,when your greatest rivals dont celebrate with emotion when scoring against you thats when you know its really down bad
TUN2aaMgozM,jose mourinho once said that getting second place with this group of players was the biggest achievement of his life now you know how right he was
TUN2aaMgozM,im not sure that ten hag is going to be enough theyre going to need 11 maybe even 12 hags to catch up with liverpool
TUN2aaMgozM,nevilles point is redundant have they spent enough money or not clearly the answer to that question is yes so the issue is recruitment souness is spot on
TUN2aaMgozM,jose was the best manager they could have had but people like gary drove him away saying he made the place toxic
TUN2aaMgozM,can managers turn things around  sure they can  take klopp at liverpool jose and carlo at madrid
TUN2aaMgozM,when carragher and keane are in agreement like that it says something
TUN2aaMgozM,i can relate where these legends are coming fromits different when to play with determination and loseacceptableno determinationno passion they need hungry players not players who feel theyve achieved all
TUN2aaMgozM,graeme graeme graeme seriously
TUN2aaMgozM,guys i dont think its the managers fault anymore
TUN2aaMgozM,jose mourinho once said that getting second place with this group of players was the biggest achievement of his life
TUN2aaMgozM,jose mourinho was right when he said getting 2nd place in 201718 with that united team is one of his finest achievements
TUN2aaMgozM,this is just a moment in time liverpool were way off united for years this is just how it goes
TUN2aaMgozM,2nd place last year was because other teams had issues and manchester united got points in some horrible performances playing oleball
TUN2aaMgozM,90 in the season and liverpool went easy on them imagine if someone back in 2012 told you what united would become this is astonishing
TUN2aaMgozM,liverpool have made improvements through the years from disasters to winners klopp has improved liverpool and improvements gained
TUN2aaMgozM,well said gary
TUN2aaMgozM,given the circumstances you genuinely have to say that ronaldo at 37 scoring this amount of goals including 2 hatricks he is the goat
TUN2aaMgozM,90 over two games and we went easy on them in both games what a time to be alive
TUN2aaMgozM,gary is spot on they are undermining managers and its not just united 
TUN2aaMgozM,united needs to sell the whole team start fresh youth and accept the next 2 years as midtable years with a view to be back on top after
TUN2aaMgozM,never did i think i would see the day where ex man utd and liverpool players would all be in agreement at how bad man utd are
TUN2aaMgozM,nail on the head garry totally undermines the manager and giving the players such godlike status can only ever be bad
TUN2aaMgozM,neville said no graham let me finish and then just repeated the same thing again definitely had been practising that line
TUN2aaMgozM,i know pundits and fans want united to fail but the fact souness was almost defending the glazers is disgusting
TUN2aaMgozM,as an arsenal fan im loving thisas a football purist this hurts my soul
TUN2aaMgozM,remember when the pundits parroted the nonsense that thiago slows liverpool down or that klopps methods bring injuries liverpool have never looked fitter and thiago has never looked better
TUN2aaMgozM,when liverpool fans actually pitty their biggest rivals instead of shoving it in our faces you know something is incredibly wrong
TUN2aaMgozM,i have much respect for neville as a liverpool fan you can definitely tell how much it pains him
TUN2aaMgozM,nothing united fans do not already know stating the obvious gary really
TUN2aaMgozM,i was pleased with the liverpool team klopp put out for this game alisson alexanderarnold matip van dijk robertson fabinho henderson thiago diaz salah mane and maguire
TUN2aaMgozM,gary is full of wisdom and managerial acumen  its a good job he put it to good use at valencia
TUN2aaMgozM,the way gary neville feels  i felt exactly the same when he played in those dismal england tournament performances at the highest level neville and his team mates were broken
TUN2aaMgozM,from 05 at old trafford to 04 at anfield a definite improvement
TUN2aaMgozM,united have now conceded more goals than burnley this season let that sink in
TUN2aaMgozM,saw the goals and it all looked too easy ive said it before they need to sort the defence and stop the leaky goals before concentrating on scoring themselves
TUN2aaMgozM,neville at 436 thats his soul leaving but he is so so right
TUN2aaMgozM,since gary start talking and made sense in his enological views manchester really lost it
TUN2aaMgozM,i completely gave up years ago back when fellaini was being played as a cf and this team still somehow disappoints me
TUN2aaMgozM,gary didnt have this much to say when his pal was in charge

Blb9LqOB6XM,not nadal  del potro  is
60XuQvakg_s,sometimes companies buy stuff from small companies and just slap their brand name on the product i thinks thats what the case is here btw its called private labelling
60XuQvakg_s,i dont understand why these fashion brands dont just do a collaboration with a highend art supplies company
60XuQvakg_s,for 2000 lv could have at least bought senneliers artist grade line to charge 2000 for student grade paint is just greed
60XuQvakg_s,if youre not going to say theyre lying then i will
60XuQvakg_s,the la petite aquarelle from sennelier is the student grade version of sennelier so that would make sense if the pigment was a bit lower 
60XuQvakg_s,i think the most shocking part is that they didnt even do the artist grade setthey chose to do the student grade set especially at that price point
60XuQvakg_s,its understandable that they have to buy the paint from a manufacturer but why not pick a very expensive premium one at least
60XuQvakg_s,amazing that no one commented on how cheap the sennies were artist grade sennelier would cost around 100 for a 12 pack obviously these must be student grade
60XuQvakg_s,aquarelle notwithstanding id like to take a second to acknowledge that
60XuQvakg_s,me i wonder what song rae will pick for the drawingpainting portion
60XuQvakg_s,love the vids they are so fun to watch i love art and watching you makes me always want to draw something
60XuQvakg_s,sometimes the more expensive ones are very similar to the cheap onesim sure most people have experienced that and it just such a shame 
60XuQvakg_s,oh wow so fashion brands that was always selling stuff that wasnt worth the price sold the stuff that wasnt worth the price
60XuQvakg_s,if they gonna go to sennelier at least use the artist line laquarelle with 2000 i think you can get the whole 98 color from the laquarelle line
60XuQvakg_s,the artist quality paints from sennelier are honestly amazing theyre expensive but for 2 thousand dollars surely they couldve used those instead
60XuQvakg_s,sennelier also makes jacksons house brand watercolors
60XuQvakg_s,early i love your videos so much i love seeing you expose art supplies and art companies and informing us about the good and bad in the art world
60XuQvakg_s,this happens in tons of industries
60XuQvakg_s,your loss is my gain i keep learning about new art companies and products from these videos  that paint pallet with the hand strap is super neat
60XuQvakg_s,was just about to sit down and paint and rae posted this what a perfect timing
60XuQvakg_s,i think that buying very expensive stuff not just art supplies but most goods is reasonable only in two cases
60XuQvakg_s,ill save you the brain pain literally every company does this anyone can make real leather accesorios for next to nothing anyways
60XuQvakg_s,your videos quite literally give me a reason to keep living thank you for being so inspiring and for fuelling young artist like me love from kenya 3
60XuQvakg_s,thank you for your wallets sacrifice for our amusement
60XuQvakg_s,at least senneliers student grade is a great hobby watercolor paint enjoy them
60XuQvakg_s,the watercolor version of
60XuQvakg_s,i love your videos because i know new things about painting and these videos are very helpful for people like me
60XuQvakg_s,paynes grey is my favourite too i just learned how to mix it and im super happy
60XuQvakg_s,girl i havent practiced with colored pencils in years i just finished a piece i had started a year ago thanks for inspiring me
60XuQvakg_s,and that is why research has to be made before buying anything in general really
60XuQvakg_s,im not even an artist at least a painter but this channel is just so great you make some great stuff thanks
60XuQvakg_s,i think you should launch youre own brand of art supplies you have tested so many brands and have good experience
60XuQvakg_s,lv is a fashion brand  youre paying for the packaging not the art supply
60XuQvakg_s,good lord i feel violated for you
60XuQvakg_s,why these lv art supplies are not worth the price
60XuQvakg_s,the reason the high brand one was so expensive is because it has the
60XuQvakg_s,id say its a scam
60XuQvakg_s,i love your vids i watch them for hours when i draw keep up the amazing vids
60XuQvakg_s,theyre like the watercolor equivalent of those fancy designer scent guest soaps  a presentation gift made to look expensive and never be used
60XuQvakg_s,amazon has some art supply bundle packagesi was wondering if youd consider looking into them and testing them out that might be a fun video
60XuQvakg_s,i have the sennelier laquarelle and i enjoy them for studies thank you for these videos
60XuQvakg_s,heres an idea dont buy designer products lol this always happens with products with a designers label smacked on it
60XuQvakg_s,i agree dont waste your money on highend nonart brand art supplies 3
60XuQvakg_s,id love to have a spare grand and a half to spend on one art supply so thank you for sharingrae
60XuQvakg_s,stop buying lv 2022 thats what im getting out of this
60XuQvakg_s,thank you really enjoyed the video  i think this was the first video ive seen on your channel  looking forward to many more
60XuQvakg_s,always get hyped for the gimme some gimme some gimme some gimme some gimme some energy part of your videos
60XuQvakg_s,omg i thought these were sennelier in your last video  so glad youre comparing them
60XuQvakg_s,hiiirae 
60XuQvakg_s,love your videos i am learning so much from you 3
60XuQvakg_s,i wonder if you could track down the pigment info on each brand
5pchMFN14dY,if aliens existed our government would have already sent foreign aid
5pchMFN14dY,ive missed this guy used to see him on how the universe works a few years ago
5pchMFN14dY,tucker always looks extremely aggressively angrily perplexed lol
5pchMFN14dY,as calvin  hobbes said  the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere is that none of it has tried to contact us
5pchMFN14dY,if the aliens land here in the usa the first communion will be please do not take us to your leader
5pchMFN14dY,this piece could have been much longer i would have appreciated michius elaborated insights dont be afraid to go on a tangent once in a while tucker
5pchMFN14dY,michio kaku a living legend gets hardly three minutes to speak aliens will not be interested in our world
5pchMFN14dY,he had me at i know its not about january 6th
5pchMFN14dY,he looks a lot older since them ancient alien days glad hes still going strong
5pchMFN14dY,tucker they extraterrestrials havent shown any malicious intent so far
5pchMFN14dY,they generate more energy than a billion suns   try to wrap your head around that i cant
5pchMFN14dY,michio kaku is getting so old i love that man and his mind truly will be missed dearly when his time comes
5pchMFN14dY,its great when a smart man admits that he doesnt know that make him a wise man
5pchMFN14dY,now that fox news covers ufo and the possibility of aliens im a fan for life
5pchMFN14dY,well they havent shown any malicious intent so far
5pchMFN14dY,anyone else think broadcasting our location to mysterious alien civilizations is probably the dumbest thing humans have ever done
5pchMFN14dY,this guy gets payed to lie its amazing how you can talk about something so much of something that doesnt exist hes kind of fluent on it
5pchMFN14dY,ill take this guy over degrasse tyson any day
5pchMFN14dY,mk is my man when someone is talking like they are reading from a book but actually arent you should listen closely he always does that
5pchMFN14dY,michio kaku is a genius i genuinely love that guy
5pchMFN14dY,watching michio kaku on tuckers show is priceless
5pchMFN14dY,this guy is amazing i could listen to him for hours
5pchMFN14dY,well done tucker youre one of the few journalists who cover this very important topic
5pchMFN14dY,intelligent design   sounds like god to me
5pchMFN14dY,i like this man funny and smart breaks the theories over the universe in simple and methodical ways we can understand
5pchMFN14dY,just the fact that hes covering this stuff earns him my respect
5pchMFN14dY,mrkaku i have been watching since my late teens on discovery channel hes definitely aging but quite well such an amazing mind
5pchMFN14dY,these are the sorts of things we should be seeing on the news rather than the reality tv craze crap this is real news
5pchMFN14dY,always enjoyable to hear from michio kaku  many blessings
5pchMFN14dY,ive always loved how thing guys speaks zero room to be cut off by news anchors because of such compelling messages
5pchMFN14dY,interesting but please give this man a little more airtime to speak his mind
5pchMFN14dY,i value this mans opinion greatlyive seen him on numerous occasions in multiple interviews and his insight and ideas are very well explained and intelligent
5pchMFN14dY,tuckers intense curiosity is why he is such a phenomenal journalist   he truly is enlightening and i respect his hard work
5pchMFN14dY,ive always believed there are some weird objects flying higher beside plans and jets thanks for reminding us about them
5pchMFN14dY,aliens arrive to earth
5pchMFN14dY,the universe everywhere can hear it that is just
5pchMFN14dY,the legendary michio kaku always one steps ahead of the pack
5pchMFN14dY,michio kaku is so happy right now its not even funny hes being proven right must be like a dream come true
5pchMFN14dY,i knew it i always believed in aliens mathematically it is impossible for them not to exist
5pchMFN14dY,dr michio kaku
5pchMFN14dY,every once in a while i like to see what tucker fox is up to alien signals being more important than overthrowing our democracy got it
5pchMFN14dY,its always good to have a teacher or professor whose voice while teaching doesnt make you want a nap whether you agree or not
5pchMFN14dY,these are two people i never thought id see sharing anything together let alone an interview
5pchMFN14dY,absolutely love tucker and the rest of the fox news cast
5pchMFN14dY,much respect to the guest implying that intelligent design could be apart of the fabric of space
5pchMFN14dY,if the rich and powerful wants you to believe something trust me sheeps  youll believe it  no matter how radical it seems
5pchMFN14dY,i love michio hes brilliant yet  never a snob
5pchMFN14dY,love michio kaku  his book the future of everything and future of humanity are wonderful books
5pchMFN14dY,this guy is awesomelove nerdy intelligent content
5pchMFN14dY,i am such a huge fan of this mans work
5pchMFN14dY,my son is a follower of kaku since he was 8 years old  this guys is so brilliant this is a fantastic clip
5pchMFN14dY,could be god or the creators if the universe why do these scientists always assume its aliens when there is no proof
5pchMFN14dY,i love how tucker was trying not to look confused or bored
5pchMFN14dY,dr michio kaku is the david suzuki of interstellar space he is a true national treasure and everyone should listen closely to what he has to say
5pchMFN14dY,i love how he felt the need to bring up january 6th when this has nothing to do with that
5pchMFN14dY,oh yeah ive heard of frbs most are actually explainable hes really talking about the ones we cannot trace back to a source
5pchMFN14dY,very cool you added this brief clip with m k
5pchMFN14dY,michio kaku was going to continue his explanation but time was up
5pchMFN14dY,i think this is finally the time for all the unexplained stuff that happens in our universe  we are not alone
5pchMFN14dY,ive had crazy dreams and decided to start lookin into this the radio bursts i believe are comin from an exoplanet trying to get help cuz their star is dying
5pchMFN14dY,man it would be so awesome to sit down have a drink a talk to this professor for hours
5pchMFN14dY,i kinda feel were getting ready for something to happen
5pchMFN14dY,i think aliens arent stupid to waste huge amounts of energy through periodic radio bursts thus the origin of the phenomenon is something natural and not aliens
5pchMFN14dY,i love that tucker brings us these stories he has always been ahead of the times on this
5pchMFN14dY,regardless of what this is all about  jesus christ is returning soon and that will be an out of this world experience
5pchMFN14dY,i learned physics reading michio kakus book and watching his video lectures he is my hero from the army of scientific light 
5pchMFN14dY,this is like an episode of ancient aliens ancient astronaut theorists theorize that theoretically this event could potentially have some level of significance
5pchMFN14dY,i wish he had more time this guy is so cool
5pchMFN14dY,he had a fun way of explaining his info
5pchMFN14dY,wow just as the bible says incredible
5pchMFN14dY,michio kaku is great in breaking down complicated theory into small bits that any lay person can understand

KxLJRAqUUeQ,my wife was genuinely sobbing when aj got it  she said oh god this is episode six all over again
KxLJRAqUUeQ,damn this is very touching good story and so much effort to make this it definitely turned out into a really cool episode 
KxLJRAqUUeQ,this is so wellwritten and wellanimated and i really didnt expected the ending much anticipated for this video this is super awesome
KxLJRAqUUeQ,love the ponies reaction to rainbow dashs death almost everyone feels bad about her and then there goes applejack and her youre so stupid dashie made me laugh so bad
KxLJRAqUUeQ,calling it now  thisll be in the top 10 pony videos of march 2022
KxLJRAqUUeQ,this was amazing you did a good job tugging at peoples heart strings
KxLJRAqUUeQ,though in the end theyre alive and well but to see them get killed and die is just heart wrenching

YfKKjKaaJdE,im loving these tech briefings dont be afraid to get more technical and into the details with these stories we would love to hear it
YfKKjKaaJdE,i miss the good old days when wsj take content seriously the depth not just throw whatever available to the audience
YfKKjKaaJdE,love these short tech briefing episodes keep em coming
YfKKjKaaJdE,while they say so the warehouses are delaying the receiving merchandise because of lack of space in the fc s
YfKKjKaaJdE,bezos jumped ship as soon as the supergrowth phase was over
YfKKjKaaJdE,this ceo took 200million as a bonus and when his workers asked for a christmas bonus and a few more bucks an hour unionize amazon
YfKKjKaaJdE,these guys come in they take out every independent
YfKKjKaaJdE,overall tech stocks have been hit  i doubt the points on which wsj is reporting
YfKKjKaaJdE,tell amazon to pay us a liveable wage without subjecting us to inhuman expectations while punishing us for following the law
YfKKjKaaJdE,it wasnt an over expansion the economy is just shrinking now
YfKKjKaaJdE,he doesnt have the drive of a founderceo thats the difference between an employee and a founder
YfKKjKaaJdE,me wait amazon has a new ceo
YfKKjKaaJdE,i didnt get the part after employees paid in stocks they not paid with money can i get a reiteration on what can cause leave
YfKKjKaaJdE,simple no more free money from fed
YfKKjKaaJdE,i was expecting visuals not a plain conversation but still informative though
YfKKjKaaJdE,wsj youtube video is no longer fun creative and interesting as before yes the information is helpful but the method is so 90s radio style
YfKKjKaaJdE,bezos might fire him
YfKKjKaaJdE,interviewer is using intonation like shes talking to a 5th grader and its very offputting
YfKKjKaaJdE,amazon downsizing
YfKKjKaaJdE,theres a reporter 5 the wsj who just covers amazon
YfKKjKaaJdE,i just clicked to check how did messi got swollen that much
YfKKjKaaJdE,looks like got pictonary sales man amazon no e commerce
YfKKjKaaJdE,im cheering for russia
YfKKjKaaJdE,wsj is becoming useless day by day learnt nothing new next time hire someone who actually has some insights not just reporting what is obvious and observed by everybody
YfKKjKaaJdE,i dont like these podcasts because no good facts present and videos
YfKKjKaaJdE,why so wsj and gang dont extort money
YfKKjKaaJdE,anyone who want wsj magazine at good deal comment
YfKKjKaaJdE,ill lyk
YfKKjKaaJdE,im sick of your injection of politics into this podcast you lost a very loyal follower now instadown thumb
YfKKjKaaJdE,lol good luck pal
YfKKjKaaJdE,you can thank jo later
YfKKjKaaJdE,oh wow zoom journalism

8ZhoeSaPF-k,the most important thing when it comes to selfimprovement are your habits
8ZhoeSaPF-k,this is so accurate i was always told that i was very smart and as a result i became lazy unproductive and unmotivated
8ZhoeSaPF-k,first it becomes motivation then determination and lastly when theres no motivation it is routine that will push you
8ZhoeSaPF-k,a few things
8ZhoeSaPF-k,ive been talking with my parents about my inconsistency with my motivation this breaks it down really well thank you for making this video 
8ZhoeSaPF-k,this is scarily accurate
8ZhoeSaPF-k,be careful not to fall into this trap not everything is within your control what you can control is how you work around obstacles and challenges
8ZhoeSaPF-k,when i was younger i always was one of the top students without doing anything so i was told i was smart and everything by my parents
8ZhoeSaPF-k,this made me realize so much about why im so demotivated i feel like i have no control almost all the time hopefully i can work on this
8ZhoeSaPF-k,as i always like to follow a particular phrase motivation will die let discipline take over
8ZhoeSaPF-k,wow i have been doing this in many aspects of my life without knowing it now i can apply it further  thanks for making this video
8ZhoeSaPF-k,i actually have an amazing example of this
8ZhoeSaPF-k,thank you
8ZhoeSaPF-k,this was a very well made video keeping it short and focused but still delivering an important message
8ZhoeSaPF-k,can we take a moment of silence for us gifted kids who are now suffering in college

8ZhoeSaPF-k,thank you you remind me actually who im and how im going in my life wish i had heard so earlier
8ZhoeSaPF-k,i am very thankful to you phil i have very low motivation and will use your hacks
8ZhoeSaPF-k,thank you i need this motivation today everything you discussed made sense
8ZhoeSaPF-k,im in a gifted class and considered smart by my teachers but i never get anything done and im always tired
8ZhoeSaPF-k,so this is why gifted and talented kids are all depressed now
8ZhoeSaPF-k,its the same concept of having a fixed mindset vs a growth mindset explained very well in the book mindset
8ZhoeSaPF-k,this video is perfect for this upcoming winter dont let the cold and gloominess of the environment knock you to the ground
8ZhoeSaPF-k,this is enlightening thank you for making this video it was more helpful than you think
8ZhoeSaPF-k,i think this was really helpful to learn and to be reminded of thanks a lot
8ZhoeSaPF-k,absolutely correct  locus of control is always in our hand
8ZhoeSaPF-k,discipline will take you to places which motivation can never
8ZhoeSaPF-k,as a kid my parents and teachers showered me with youre so smart
8ZhoeSaPF-k,you have no idea how much u hv helped me realize the reasons to my lack of motivation thank u im working twice as hard now
8ZhoeSaPF-k,hello i dont know you but
8ZhoeSaPF-k,thanks great video
8ZhoeSaPF-k,problem is that its hard to keep this up and believe in your hard work when everyone else blames it on talent and natural skills or even luck
8ZhoeSaPF-k,youve gotta dance like theres nobody watching love like youll never be hurt sing like theres nobody listening and live like its heaven on earth william w purkey
8ZhoeSaPF-k,yesterday ive done an exam that concerned this topic its such a coincidence ive found this video on my youtube home page shortly after
8ZhoeSaPF-k,thank you for the videoi will take the control of my life by working hard from now on inshaallah
8ZhoeSaPF-k,will surely take things in my hands
8ZhoeSaPF-k,the teacher tells you that you succeeded because you worked hard
8ZhoeSaPF-k,i love the part where they talk about the control of your destiny and then words on screen read internal locus of control never have
8ZhoeSaPF-k,this is rule 1 in 7 habits of highly effective people focus on your circle of influence
8ZhoeSaPF-k,volunteering as salesperson is the most life changing experience in my life even im not working in sales anymore but the skills motivation and mindset is last long

3D2V3mf1DcU,what are your thoughts on the new ps plus hope you enjoyed my coverage of it
3D2V3mf1DcU,extra is definitely the best value premium still needs a little work but it has potential
3D2V3mf1DcU,definitely extra super reasonable price with so many games to choose from its actually pretty awesome
3D2V3mf1DcU,premium offers initially good features until you realize the scope of selection for the classic games once the libraries are increased it will great
3D2V3mf1DcU,i have had both extra and premiumdeluxe extra is definitely the best choice if your not sure to go straight onto premium or not
3D2V3mf1DcU,well explained so just upgraded to extra seems the best option for me currently
3D2V3mf1DcU,in australia for an upgrade from essential to extra is 5198  our premium is called deluxe with is 7089 for an upgrade
3D2V3mf1DcU,hit that like button everyone great job as always keep up the great work
3D2V3mf1DcU,hi spawnpoiint amazing video it reflects how you love gaming from a ps fan to another just thanks for having created this wonderful channel ps plus
3D2V3mf1DcU,i picked extra although i already own all first party titles there are around 25 games im interested in and havent played yet
3D2V3mf1DcU,nice stuff spawnpoiint
3D2V3mf1DcU,im a newbie to gaming and just got my ps5 thank you for this helpful advice on playstation plus appreciate you
3D2V3mf1DcU,great ps plus video
3D2V3mf1DcU,extra is the best just downloaded rdr2 ghost of tsushima watch dogs valhalla sniper elite 4 and a bunch more
3D2V3mf1DcU,awesome mate your videos are really informative and well put together thanks
3D2V3mf1DcU,you can buy certain extra and premium games individually as well great video 
3D2V3mf1DcU,extra is it for me it comes with all of the pros of essential but with the games catalogue premium needs a work around
3D2V3mf1DcU,i hope sony could one day provide day and date release their 1st3rd party exclusive or maybe they could give some benifits for buying games
3D2V3mf1DcU,im gonna have to try out premium im so stoked they have ape escape and toy story 2 both of those games instantly take me back to my childhood
3D2V3mf1DcU,extra is the best for me because it has all the big games from playstation now but the premium option is the best for those that want the classics
3D2V3mf1DcU,this man is just sooo underrated god bless this man  love the amount off effort put into the vids
3D2V3mf1DcU,thank for detailed video man
3D2V3mf1DcU,great video sp definitely got all that i needed from this video thanks for the great content bro ps plus
3D2V3mf1DcU,maybe its different in the uk but in the us most listed games must be purchased even with the premium plan
3D2V3mf1DcU,i already knew the ins and outs however i watched anyway as spawnpoiint videos are literally some of the best content on youtube
3D2V3mf1DcU,they need to bring back playstation home
3D2V3mf1DcU,extra has unreal value for money makes me kinda sad i already own most of the ps5 games though lol
3D2V3mf1DcU,do you keep the games you downloaded from extra if you decide to return back to essential
3D2V3mf1DcU,is syphon filter included with extra 
3D2V3mf1DcU,extra is definitely worth it
3D2V3mf1DcU,extra has the best value for now if more and new game trails get added then premium definitely
3D2V3mf1DcU,if they add def jam or the nba streets series to the classic section id definitely buy it
3D2V3mf1DcU,i finally ordered my ps5 last week on saturday and its going to arrive tomorrow and i cant stop thinking about it even though i have final tests this week
3D2V3mf1DcU,game catalogue is a game trial itself
3D2V3mf1DcU,cloud streaming makes you able to try out hundreds of games without having to worry about storage
3D2V3mf1DcU,can you make a separate video showing all the games available with the extra and premium plan i mean all of them
3D2V3mf1DcU,how much am i regretting buying the disc version of the ps5
3D2V3mf1DcU,ps plus
3D2V3mf1DcU,ps plus
3D2V3mf1DcU,this is just sonys answer to xbox gamepass which also includes awesome cloud streaming and in my opinion its a joke right now to even get this
3D2V3mf1DcU,i started with premium but after noticing not a whole lot of stuff from ps13 im interested in i went ahead and downgraded to extra
3D2V3mf1DcU,who else would love to see mgs1 and mgs2 for ps1 and ps2 respectively
3D2V3mf1DcU,so if you add a game to the library do you get to keep it like before on the old ps plus 
3D2V3mf1DcU,amazing as always
3D2V3mf1DcU,do the games from the games catalog include any dlcs that have been released for the games
3D2V3mf1DcU,will have to check mine out and see if ive been upgraded
3D2V3mf1DcU,should have been only two tiers
3D2V3mf1DcU,im subscribed to the channel and im from brazil im a fan of the channel and all its content my wife loves its design and decorations hugs from brazil
3D2V3mf1DcU,i choose extra downloaded demons souls and returnal and i m pretty satisfied  ps plus
3D2V3mf1DcU,yea i tried ollie world yesterday it was pretty cool ill get it eventually maybe on my switch
3D2V3mf1DcU,wish i had the time to play all these games lucky to get an hour a day in
3D2V3mf1DcU,awesome room set up what is the rooms dimensions
3D2V3mf1DcU,its very noble of sony to make the three tiers so confusing so we all have to come and watch your explainer  ps plus
3D2V3mf1DcU,a dedicated video comparing this to game pass would definently be interesting ps plus
3D2V3mf1DcU,i am so excited for ps plus service i want to see which tier is the best  and according to my research google says the premium is the best one
3D2V3mf1DcU,i have both ps5 and the xbox sx and i have enjoyed game pass much more
3D2V3mf1DcU,ps plus yea extra definitely seems like the way to go until we see some more classic titles added
3D2V3mf1DcU,ps plus  thanks for all the info
3D2V3mf1DcU,class vid  think ill be buying a month and playing the games i wanna play
3D2V3mf1DcU,i bought premium because of the cloud streaming i can play old games that i have never played
3D2V3mf1DcU,i got my ps5 disc console tonight i was wondering which one to get i think i will do a yearly plan of premium thanks for your video
3D2V3mf1DcU,hi im looking for the best external hard drive for my ps5 to store games on which one would you recommend
3D2V3mf1DcU,ps plus  love your videos been waiting for a new one
3D2V3mf1DcU,hope stuntman gets added mam what a game that was 
A5VDHd4Imjk,woulda been nice to actually see how far that girl was shooting the arrows coulda been 10 feet for all we know
A5VDHd4Imjk,that is why kelsey plum is in the all star game
A5VDHd4Imjk,life is short thing
A5VDHd4Imjk,i laughed so hard on that bike that took off on a vengeance
A5VDHd4Imjk,amazing videos
A5VDHd4Imjk,anyone know the names of the two fighters nose to nose id love to see the match
A5VDHd4Imjk,id say a fraction could be considered 1 in a million the rest could be uploaded by fail army
A5VDHd4Imjk,okay what the heck
A5VDHd4Imjk,gentlemen of culture another meeting comes to order
A5VDHd4Imjk,nice fails mixed with amazing highlights
A5VDHd4Imjk,should the title be renamed as funny moments in womens sports
A5VDHd4Imjk,i wish womens sports were more like mens sports then we wouldnt have to watch women play
A5VDHd4Imjk,i tell you nay but except ye repent ye shall all likewise perish luke 135 kjv
A5VDHd4Imjk,la ultima del ping pong con la caragenial
A5VDHd4Imjk,what level was that very last one on
A5VDHd4Imjk,that weight lifting one was just nasty
A5VDHd4Imjk,women are so lovely
A5VDHd4Imjk,saved the best for last
A5VDHd4Imjk,the 2 black girls the hurdle  the splits 1 always funny when theres fake hair involved
A5VDHd4Imjk,women can do some amazing things too good video
A5VDHd4Imjk,babygirl that threw the shirts at the game has a cannon arm
A5VDHd4Imjk,last female was honestly just embarrassing herself
A5VDHd4Imjk,do you understand what one in a million meansobviously not
A5VDHd4Imjk,i think the most georgeous women in sports nowadays is a girl named daria klishina
A5VDHd4Imjk,ahhhh men of culture we meet again
A5VDHd4Imjk,the girl throwing the shirt at the basketball game looks like a woman named rachel w
A5VDHd4Imjk,gotta say that i was expecting a completely different content on this video
A5VDHd4Imjk,theres a lot of things here which are definitely not sports
A5VDHd4Imjk,i whould say 1 in 559 milions for some of them
A5VDHd4Imjk,why is the korean archer one in a million moment
A5VDHd4Imjk,that was extremely disappointing
A5VDHd4Imjk,gotta like watching those fit sexy girls but this is misleading title  lot of them are very normal for someone who has skill and experience
A5VDHd4Imjk,why is professional wrestling labeled as 1 in a millionits always the same crap just a different day
A5VDHd4Imjk,you need an ad blocker for watching this video
A5VDHd4Imjk,video top i advise
A5VDHd4Imjk,aussie lady weight lifter needs to endorsement gillete shavers
A5VDHd4Imjk,good luck
A5VDHd4Imjk,and women and men should compete at the same levelha
A5VDHd4Imjk,one cannot include professional wrestling as a sport this is garbage
A5VDHd4Imjk,i dont get the title one in a million moments guess you can just make up any title without understanding the meaning of it
A5VDHd4Imjk,she was using aim bot lol
A5VDHd4Imjk,got to love thumbnail
A5VDHd4Imjk,what the heck underwater boxing
A5VDHd4Imjk,one in a million women lifts up her skirt
A5VDHd4Imjk,umm maybe should be titled women doing mostly unremarkable stuff
A5VDHd4Imjk,daaamn did you see that sweater growing underneath that chinese weightlifters arms wtf her hormones are off the chain
A5VDHd4Imjk,no one thought to warn the guy at
A5VDHd4Imjk,what you want 
A5VDHd4Imjk,clearly a man was editing this smh
A5VDHd4Imjk,tem umas mulher atrapalhada ns esportes
A5VDHd4Imjk,maybe 2 of those clips were great athletic plays a soccer ref marking a line on the field seriously ill stay away from wasting time watching your videos
A5VDHd4Imjk,what is the match in 320
A5VDHd4Imjk,this is real shit
A5VDHd4Imjk,hairy pits stopped watching

9RnQviK3Dso,thanks for watching who else is getting a spyra water gun
9RnQviK3Dso,to those complaining about the price this isnt a kids toy its a peice of technology thats catered for adults who grew up with super soakers
9RnQviK3Dso,if you fill it with holy water then it becomes a great weapon against vampires and werewolves
9RnQviK3Dso,this is the coolest unnecessary toy ive seen lately
9RnQviK3Dso,that is incredibly cool  i cant imagine buying one but it looks super fun
9RnQviK3Dso,the rich kids are gonna love it
9RnQviK3Dso,ill wait for the bluetooth one that plays music during missions
9RnQviK3Dso,amazing product just needs to be a little less expensive for the third gen to go worldwide
9RnQviK3Dso,good thing there was nothing wrong with pumping my 3 water gun
9RnQviK3Dso,great video well paced informative and funny
9RnQviK3Dso,12 second reload time no you should always switch to 2nd weapon  always
9RnQviK3Dso,best review ever getting one even though its pricey
9RnQviK3Dso,such a simple idea probably very cheap to make pretty cool
9RnQviK3Dso,ill wait for elon musks version of this
9RnQviK3Dso,waiting for a knock off version for wayyy lower price  it looks cool though
9RnQviK3Dso,super cool gun definitely at the top of the class but i still cant help but think  200 for a water gun
9RnQviK3Dso,wow looks like it even has a picatinny rail at the front
9RnQviK3Dso,great video i got to have one of those water guns
9RnQviK3Dso,finally we have reached the peak in technology
9RnQviK3Dso,okay now imagine this with a water pressure cutter and you got a close range weapon
9RnQviK3Dso,man this is like a big upgrade from the super soaker
9RnQviK3Dso,now waiting for the bugasalt version of this with full auto mode
9RnQviK3Dso,super soaker 2000 was pretty impressive this is quite the rival spyra updated more technological easier refill nice
9RnQviK3Dso,spyra2 seems like vaporware been trying to buy one for months and the delivery date keeps getting pushed out
9RnQviK3Dso,these things are super fun i ordered the set and one was broken when received and to spyra replaced it in about 2 weeks
9RnQviK3Dso,i dont care about the price im buying one this is the coolest water gun i ever seen
9RnQviK3Dso,id love to buy one of they werent always sold out
9RnQviK3Dso,oh i immediately knew i wasnt going to buy one when you said its 174 but it is pretty cool
9RnQviK3Dso,the price is outrageous i could buy a fully automatic airsoft rifle for that kind of money but its a cool idea
9RnQviK3Dso,super soaker had a similar concept years ago with a contraption that attached to a garden hose and you stuck the front of the water gun into it to reload
9RnQviK3Dso,the question  isit fully water resistant in full water submerge and whats the ip rating
9RnQviK3Dso,great review
9RnQviK3Dso,i wish i could afford these
9RnQviK3Dso,now im gonna have to get some for my kiddos
9RnQviK3Dso,we have the dual pack and they are awesome
9RnQviK3Dso,i bought a set they are super cool kids and i have a blast with them
9RnQviK3Dso,the pumping one at costco you can get 2 for 20 and refills with a giant lid
9RnQviK3Dso,imagine adding a water bagpack as accessory
9RnQviK3Dso,is it compatible with a standard sight and other add ons
9RnQviK3Dso,i love the shape design
9RnQviK3Dso,if this was just a bit cheaper it would be perfect
9RnQviK3Dso,great video all content no filler
9RnQviK3Dso,imagine hearing mom did you charge my water gun
9RnQviK3Dso,thats amazing  if i was a child id totally want that
9RnQviK3Dso,this would help out good in work or in practice
9RnQviK3Dso,i miss the entertech semi realistic motorized water guns those were nice dangerous in these days and times though
9RnQviK3Dso,looks cool but for that price id rather spend it on something else 
9RnQviK3Dso,seems to work great as a deterant
9RnQviK3Dso,i want this does anyone know if its waterproof
9RnQviK3Dso,next thing which needs electricity to work great
9RnQviK3Dso,back in my day water guns cost 15 dollers and we pump it manually without electricity
9RnQviK3Dso,would like to know how long does the power stay good for
9RnQviK3Dso,for 170 bucks us i can buy 4 battery powered water guns  or an entire arsenal of guns 
9RnQviK3Dso,this would be so messed up to take to an airsoft game
9RnQviK3Dso,damn this is amazing
9RnQviK3Dso,this is so cool i just bought it
9RnQviK3Dso,what is the distance  in feet for both normal shot and power shot thanks for the video
9RnQviK3Dso,what is the tank capacity how many liters
9RnQviK3Dso,dope i need one
9RnQviK3Dso,not sure if its worth it for me i live in the uk and only get 2 weeks of summer sunshine
9RnQviK3Dso,it looks really cool but 170 is quite a lot for a water gun maybe when im rich
9RnQviK3Dso,best water gun was super soaker 50 hands down
9RnQviK3Dso,regardless of the price your inner kid wants this
9RnQviK3Dso,this spyra 2 look like the plasma gun
9RnQviK3Dso,finally something playable
9RnQviK3Dso,gosh this thing is cool
9RnQviK3Dso,was expecting it to be stronger and spray linger continuous streams
9RnQviK3Dso,thats pretty awesome ngl
9RnQviK3Dso,where can you find one
9RnQviK3Dso,the bad trigger discipline drives me crazy holy man
9RnQviK3Dso,if you fill it with booze then you become spring breaks fav booze dispenser for about 15 minutes
9RnQviK3Dso,that thing is sick should of made a halo color scheme one
9RnQviK3Dso,really good video
9RnQviK3Dso,finna mount these to that segway c80 im still eyeing pew pew karens
9RnQviK3Dso,no answer to the most important question does salt water mess it up can you even use salt water this would be awesome to know
9RnQviK3Dso,is this safe for petroleum based liquids i know that supersoakers were not
9RnQviK3Dso,if it is a watergun i guess it should waterproof or not that max immersion depth sign confuses me
9RnQviK3Dso,so cool  i want one
9RnQviK3Dso,thats still not as powerful or shoots as far as the old school super soakers  not including the backpacks for extra long fights
9RnQviK3Dso,id love one but not for that price
9RnQviK3Dso,can you imagine if sam and dean had this in season 2
9RnQviK3Dso,here kids i got you guys all super soakers
9RnQviK3Dso,is this watergun fully water proof
9RnQviK3Dso,did just fine with my super soaker as a kid ridiculous price
9RnQviK3Dso,can you take it apart to see how it works 
9RnQviK3Dso,hahaha this is so rad i want at least two team red 4 lyfe 8d
9RnQviK3Dso,erm i thought matthias and mr beast already reviewed this months or years ago  but hey at least its finally available
9RnQviK3Dso,the one im waiting for isnt yet out but i dont know which one probably much better than that one  just kidding i cant afford
9RnQviK3Dso,i would love to see elon musks flamethrower and this watergun in battle
9RnQviK3Dso,who else just waiting this gun to be a gamecompetition in dude perfect video
9RnQviK3Dso,considering water guns are mostly a poor kids game im sure the adults will love this
9RnQviK3Dso,bit expensivemy kids would totally break that thing but otherwise its kinda neat
9RnQviK3Dso,im sure for 179 dollars the real price to make is around 20 dollars
XYX-IZa3rNs,ty hits cody perfectly
XYX-IZa3rNs,that huge amount of pins in the finale gave me memories of the singleplayer mode of wii sports bowling

XYX-IZa3rNs,i have a quick question for ty why would you say team coby always and forever and now leave team coby what happened there man
XYX-IZa3rNs,when it says cobys total is 37 when its actually 38
XYX-IZa3rNs,i feel like they should give coby a second attempt
XYX-IZa3rNs,can you do bowling stereotypes cuz that would be amazing
XYX-IZa3rNs,dude perfect is so addictive 
XYX-IZa3rNs,im always team coby
XYX-IZa3rNs,for the record cobys final score was actully 38 they forgot to count the baseball

znrNrfv__D4,such harsher penalties for weed were imposed by the west and forced on other countries tooonce westusa relaxed its policies suddenly rest of the world too
D45kcWgVJ7s,europe why does america spend so much on its military
D45kcWgVJ7s,it would surely be nice if he committed so strongly to any thing here in the usa as he does to every foreign government on what seems a regular basis
D45kcWgVJ7s,joetato must defend his laundering state at all costs
D45kcWgVJ7s,and the usa is last on joes list again
D45kcWgVJ7s,i dont think this is the right time to commit more troops and money to any area including europe
D45kcWgVJ7s,the terms strong and military cant coincide in a sentence during this administration
D45kcWgVJ7s,joe biden i may be irish but im not stupid
D45kcWgVJ7s,rightits not like were in a financial crisis in this country lets continue providing money and personnel for european countries who refuse to pay their fair share
D45kcWgVJ7s,the question everyone should be asking is why is biden still in office
D45kcWgVJ7s,and they said trump was going to get us into wwiii the irony
D45kcWgVJ7s,why cant the europeans do it themselves
D45kcWgVJ7s,we pulled out of afghanistan w people falling off planes because it was too costlybut well continuing sending unlimited 50b checks to ukraine  forever
D45kcWgVJ7s,i bet the people who voted for him are extremely proud their fragile feelings were hurt on twitter so now they had to make everyone suffer in the process
D45kcWgVJ7s,he should deploy military to chicago philadelphia and baltimore
D45kcWgVJ7s,god bless joe
D45kcWgVJ7s,go protect your laundering front brandon thats americas biggest concern
D45kcWgVJ7s,is he going to drone some more kids
D45kcWgVJ7s,im just surprised he was able to get down the stairs unharmed
D45kcWgVJ7s,he cant even ride a bike without falling off
D45kcWgVJ7s,the day is fast approaching to where the us wont be able to even pay the interest on its debt but keep the quantitative easing coming
D45kcWgVJ7s,i can see where this is heading
D45kcWgVJ7s,stronger thats great he is weakening our economy and keeps going against his own words
D45kcWgVJ7s,biden has many ways on how to spend american dollarscome on joehelp your own country
D45kcWgVJ7s,its be nice if europe started making european problems well european problems and not the worlds problem
D45kcWgVJ7s,i hope hes talking about helping bosnia and hercegovina  to join nato
D45kcWgVJ7s,hey 1825 year olds soon you might be singing the little man from the draft boardis coming to see me
D45kcWgVJ7s,ah his cards must have read keep mongering that war
D45kcWgVJ7s,people cant afford gas rent or groceries good job joe democrats should concede jan 6th and put the real president back in office america needs the maga king
D45kcWgVJ7s,great job if i ever travel to europe i will somehow feel safer than walking in my own streets in usa
D45kcWgVJ7s,this is not going to end well i wasnt going to take a vacation this summer but maybe i should one last island country to see until ww 3
D45kcWgVJ7s,dont underestimate joes ability to f things up
D45kcWgVJ7s,hows he going to do that when less and less people are singing up for our military due to there policies
D45kcWgVJ7s,what does stronger presence mean  that military personell wont be in skirts and heels
D45kcWgVJ7s,there is a strong presence in oljoes diaper
D45kcWgVJ7s,sending our troops to defend the whs client states are we joe looks like 10 is on the menu
D45kcWgVJ7s,biden is a front manfall guy for the business that actually runs the country
D45kcWgVJ7s,i was young when the cold war ended and not two years into bidens run were right back there
D45kcWgVJ7s,biden sure is great at showing that he cares more about the rest of the world than he does about the us
D45kcWgVJ7s,5 billion every month
D45kcWgVJ7s,theyre gonna find a way to declare war its only a matter of time
D45kcWgVJ7s,i just hope those who voted for this incompetent corrupt sieve of a subhuman are pleased with their choice
D45kcWgVJ7s,biden has no problem sending troops in harms way  funny how he wouldnt even stand with them and dodged the draft
D45kcWgVJ7s,how about some resources used on our southern border to keep the illegal invaders out
D45kcWgVJ7s,so i wonder how much biden will get in kickbacks for sending our troops and money overseas
D45kcWgVJ7s,why cant our leaders commit to our wellbeing instead of another pointless war
D45kcWgVJ7s,he promises to send more billions of our taxdollars yippee
D45kcWgVJ7s,right back into the cold war
D45kcWgVJ7s,great job brandonyou need a card to tell you where to sit and when to talk and you are making military moves  scarey as hell
D45kcWgVJ7s,biden is better off calling out bingo numbers at his nursing home
D45kcWgVJ7s,so glad we got rid of mean tweets so we could get are war game back on lets go brandon
D45kcWgVJ7s,for whatsoever they sow that shall they also reap
D45kcWgVJ7s,5 billion is needed in united states   housing  infrastructure needed this is ridiculous
D45kcWgVJ7s,how does everybody feel about a feeble old man representing the great nation of america we need better
D45kcWgVJ7s,for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life
D45kcWgVJ7s,whats the range of drones and can they carry a nuclear warhead
D45kcWgVJ7s,not our war
D45kcWgVJ7s,luke 211112
D45kcWgVJ7s,what an embarrassment
D45kcWgVJ7s,bendiciones hermosa celina que dios te cuidel donde quiera que
D45kcWgVJ7s,biden is still rocked from falling off his bike
D45kcWgVJ7s,well there goes my european vacation
D45kcWgVJ7s,butttttt not the border interesting
D45kcWgVJ7s,awesome lets piss some more money away
D45kcWgVJ7s,knowing what a great negotiator biden is i but he agreed that the usa will pick up the check for all additional costs what a maroon
D45kcWgVJ7s,this entire admin is a dumpster fire
D45kcWgVJ7s,hope europe sends some military to defend our bordersthe way canada has been acting we should probably build a wall there too
D45kcWgVJ7s,maybe potatus ought to strengthen up our border and economy before starting ww3
D45kcWgVJ7s,wwiii is getting closer thanks brandon
D45kcWgVJ7s,good job liberals you voted for this 
D45kcWgVJ7s,biden  i sit where  lol  need a cheat card 
D45kcWgVJ7s,joe  single handedly saving the world 
D45kcWgVJ7s,no no no  i thought they where not allowed to go to at with out congressional approval  by we the people  we do not want war
D45kcWgVJ7s,brandon over here really wants to be the pale horseman of the apocalypse
D45kcWgVJ7s,how about a stronger presence at our border
D45kcWgVJ7s,great job brandon just add this to his long list of failures lets go brandon
D45kcWgVJ7s,if people knew the kind of damage covid vaccines were doing to us military personel
D45kcWgVJ7s,jotato and strong doesnt belong in the same sentence
D45kcWgVJ7s,as soon as he can buy back 85 billion dollars worth of military equipment left in afghanistan
D45kcWgVJ7s,hes hasnt a clue
D45kcWgVJ7s,2 destroyers to spain
PDrTpXIIZwE,sorry but the trashy fashions looks trashy at any age
PDrTpXIIZwE,im sorry but with the possible exception of the short denim cutoffs the trashy clothes in the first two items look horrible on anybody no matter what their age
PDrTpXIIZwE,these days its difficult to say hard truths without being roasted for being insensitive or whatever there are things that objectively look betterworse than other looks
PDrTpXIIZwE,im so over the neutral trend wear colors if you want and dont limit your outfits based on your age
PDrTpXIIZwE,love this video im entering my late layer 30s or as we say 35 again i try to choose things that make me feel
PDrTpXIIZwE,i basically never disagree with you forever my fashion mom you are incredible
PDrTpXIIZwE,nothing to be mad about truth not dressing your age is oddly very aging on a person
PDrTpXIIZwE,the bodycon and boot pic you first showed was a classic look i love a turtleneck dress and boot combo looks great at any age
PDrTpXIIZwE,speaking the truth yassss always respected your pov so thank you no try hard here i love you
PDrTpXIIZwE,you have nailed the tacky fashion sense of some older people i am 64  love fashion however l try to wear fashion that suits me
PDrTpXIIZwE,nobody can be mad at you for saying the truth blessings
PDrTpXIIZwE,fun video fashion mom we love you too
PDrTpXIIZwE,am i the only one who thinks the 7080 year old woman who wears bodycon dresses is awesome i love people who dgaf and wear what they want
PDrTpXIIZwE,the sweater you are wearing is so unique and beautiful
PDrTpXIIZwE,thanks meytalwe are glad you enjoy our shoeswe will strive to make more comfortable heels
PDrTpXIIZwE,i love a senior fashonisitagorgeous and much different than overly tight etc
PDrTpXIIZwE,love meytallove 7or9 shoes they are so comfortable and beautiful
PDrTpXIIZwE,i agree thanks for always saying the truth  marie from sweden
PDrTpXIIZwE,i really think it depends on the person and the body type   whether the clothes fit  and whether they truly look comfortable in what they are wearing
PDrTpXIIZwE,i adore the sweater
PDrTpXIIZwE,do we mean try too hard or just never had a clue the kiddy thing is just exploitation imho great analysis

PDrTpXIIZwE,i agree with u 100 i cant believe i just found u
PDrTpXIIZwE,so much truth
PDrTpXIIZwE,on point
PDrTpXIIZwE,love that sweater
PDrTpXIIZwE,totally agree that ragged end short shorts are for the 2030 set  we have our shot at all of that
PDrTpXIIZwE,some of us 50 women take great care of ourselves eat well exercise and dont want to wear tweed jackets and pearls lol
PDrTpXIIZwE,i really love you attitude
PDrTpXIIZwE,keep it real
PDrTpXIIZwE,btw urban revivo takes forever to ship
PDrTpXIIZwE,does fashion still exist after covid lol
PDrTpXIIZwE,agree 150 percent 
PDrTpXIIZwE,yep i am 48 i totally agree
PDrTpXIIZwE,great video pls share where u got your sweater from

v-2wt9lf2D4,at ronaldos level right now he doesnt need to stay at a team rebuilding he needs to be on a team aiming for trophies
v-2wt9lf2D4,ronaldo to chelsea would be a great move for ronaldo and chelsea
v-2wt9lf2D4,de jong has been moving closer to united for about 3 weeks now
v-2wt9lf2D4,would be wicked to see him at chelsea
v-2wt9lf2D4,looks like de jong is moving to manchester by foot because hes been getting closer to united for over 2 weeks now
v-2wt9lf2D4,as long as the likes of maguire and the current ownership is at this club we will always have a weak mentality
v-2wt9lf2D4,ronaldo staying at united is like being in a toxic relationship and being scared for breaking up
v-2wt9lf2D4,if he moves to chelsea ishowspeed will be heart broken
v-2wt9lf2D4,united should try and get frankie de jong as well as de ligt put maguire and lindelof as backup cbs
v-2wt9lf2D4,he would never have moved to chelsea realistically but he should move if transfer buisness does not improve
v-2wt9lf2D4,why oh why are man utd chasing de jong who has said he doesnt want to go
v-2wt9lf2D4,im a liverpool fan i think he would fit in the squad perfectly he fits in any squad anyway
v-2wt9lf2D4,he would score where every he went but would he be worth the huge salary he would no doubt command 
v-2wt9lf2D4,im a united fan i completely support cr7 leaving asking him to play 37 at his age is unforgiving
v-2wt9lf2D4,its look like ronaldo is pushing the boardmanuto sign top playerwant to build top team in this transfer and want to challenge epl title
v-2wt9lf2D4,i ll be honest  i think ronaldo might be regretting not signing with city last season  keeping all man utd memories and every feelings included 
v-2wt9lf2D4,ronaldo wont play for another british club
v-2wt9lf2D4,tells you all you need to know about man utd and where the club is at the moment when eriksen is seriously considering joining brentford over them
v-2wt9lf2D4,we need atleast 5 new players and we are fixating and playing ball just for 1 player for over 3 weeks while other teams fibishing their business early
v-2wt9lf2D4,it doesnt matter who they sign if theyre still starting maguire
v-2wt9lf2D4,as a united fan i have a question for you guys
v-2wt9lf2D4,barcelona need to keep de jong as they rebuild with kessie and the others and frankie seems intent on staying
v-2wt9lf2D4,as long as we have maguire and if we cant get 3 good top class players we will end lower down the table next year
v-2wt9lf2D4,not sure if erickson gets game time if im honest  unless hes happy being rotated
v-2wt9lf2D4,man city  liverpool will go head to head yet again for the title by the looks of this transfer window
v-2wt9lf2D4,ronaldo needs lessons in pressing and tracking back
v-2wt9lf2D4,de jong is not the only player needed other departments needs strength go on bringing other targets before known will end up materializing 
v-2wt9lf2D4,2nd without ronaldo 7th with ronaldo fantastic decision
v-2wt9lf2D4,united should speed up their signings so players could involve in preseason
v-2wt9lf2D4,why do united always go from mainstream signings
v-2wt9lf2D4,bruh imagine if chelsea sign ronaldo
v-2wt9lf2D4,only player the glazers actually care about  not good for their business if he leaves  make the signings now 
v-2wt9lf2D4,chelsea should go for son heungmin or kane ten hag has cr7 in his 20222023 campaign plan and ronaldo himself hasnt signaled that he wants to leave
v-2wt9lf2D4,id definitely take ronaldo for a year at chelsea i dont think its gonna happen though i think hell either end up joining bayern munich or staying at manchester united
v-2wt9lf2D4,lets wait for some players to join our united however we have delayed for sometime
v-2wt9lf2D4,eriksonde jong and donny all reunited this week under erik
v-2wt9lf2D4,so now players having a hard time deciding between manu and brentford
v-2wt9lf2D4,frankie de jong should run million miles from man united
v-2wt9lf2D4,i dont think man utd know what a reasonable fee for a player is after maguire
v-2wt9lf2D4,is this an exact quote from haag united wont be rushed into a deal no barcelona wont sell him until they have lewandowski
v-2wt9lf2D4,if somebody know a good reason for de jong or eriksen wanting a move to manchester united please give me lights
v-2wt9lf2D4,as a fan of one of the other 19 clubs in the league i hope he stays the dressing room will remain toxic af
v-2wt9lf2D4,negotiating more than 5weeks  to give barca what they want  absolute  shambles this agent
v-2wt9lf2D4,the current united team without ronaldo might struggle to finish top half
v-2wt9lf2D4,chelsea utd ronaldo can destroy you with one signature from his hand
v-2wt9lf2D4,seeing the back of pogba is truly truly brilliant now only if we could see the back of slabhead
v-2wt9lf2D4,im a man united fan and currently a bigger fan of ronaldo if he leaves i wouldnt blame him i wish him well
v-2wt9lf2D4,this year cant  get any worse  for manchester united
v-2wt9lf2D4,lol and they just had to mention pogba hes the goto where transfer talk is concerned on sky
v-2wt9lf2D4,i cant see chelsea going for ronaldo hes not what tuchel wants or needs atm
v-2wt9lf2D4,last season juventus manager allegri also said ronaldo will stay at juventus
v-2wt9lf2D4,all the other clubs sign players
v-2wt9lf2D4,cr7 have a clause in his contract  if man utd failed to qualify for ucl he can leave the club 
v-2wt9lf2D4,i  just wanna see cris playing ucl  before  he retire doesnt matter if people blame him for glory hunter 
v-2wt9lf2D4,we are only gona sign frank this whole transfer window
v-2wt9lf2D4,hes definitely up for sale then 100
v-2wt9lf2D4,closer fc deducing fc discussion fc
v-2wt9lf2D4,viva ronaldo viva ronaldo running down the wing and united sing viva ronaldo
v-2wt9lf2D4,congratz to signing a player that doesnt want to be at man utd yes the coach wants him but its nothing more than barca needing money
v-2wt9lf2D4,man united take as long as possible just to pay too much for a player
v-2wt9lf2D4,for the first time of cr7s career he has to stay and fight for c2 title with mu poor  him
v-2wt9lf2D4,cl king needs to be in the cl this season
v-2wt9lf2D4,i hope ronaldo stays  he loves manchester united
v-2wt9lf2D4,ronaldo has more integrity than most managers
v-2wt9lf2D4,awesome lets sign another player that doesnt want to move clubs
v-2wt9lf2D4,brentford or man u and hes torn lol  speaks volumes about man u today
v-2wt9lf2D4,united doesnt really have any high quality player except for ronaldo the other players are totally unknown they could have played for fulham nobody would even care
v-2wt9lf2D4,i think united will sign 4 players in the next few weeks  and finish 4th next season
v-2wt9lf2D4,de jong is open to being with ten hag again just not at united
v-2wt9lf2D4,at chelsea ronaldo will score 25 goals plus
v-2wt9lf2D4,many will get fed up or to be blame for not helping cr7 scoring many goals burden on the team

HcyC8IdIy-Q,it is better to fail in originality than to succeed in imitation herman melville
HcyC8IdIy-Q,hahaha awesome video it makes me rage that he gets so much money from youtube for getting people rekt
HcyC8IdIy-Q,have you noticed how jeremy has been pumping out more vids lately  i feel he wants to recoup his recent losses

HcyC8IdIy-Q,i dont understand y u dont like him hes not losing u any money
HcyC8IdIy-Q,put a shirt on  just my opinion  i dont get that part of the schtik
SA_lLbwO4s8,i wanna know yall opinion on this
SA_lLbwO4s8,imagine the amount of kids and adults walking around thinking their father is a shitty person because of mothers like her
SA_lLbwO4s8,the audacity she has to film him providing food for the only child hes obligated to provide for is beyond me trying to make him seen as the villain smh
SA_lLbwO4s8,this man needs to use her video against her in court and take custody of his child because she obviously cant feed her children properly while on government assistance
SA_lLbwO4s8,the father seems like a stand up dude props to him for keeping his boy fed
SA_lLbwO4s8,this made me cry i would have loved it if my sons dad would have showed up with his favorite dinner
SA_lLbwO4s8,the child thats mine silly my fav line ol boy said
SA_lLbwO4s8,my heart aches for the good men trying to do right by their kids only to be demonized by vindictive entitled bitter mothers
SA_lLbwO4s8,i love how he asked where the other kids dads were at and she went completely silent
SA_lLbwO4s8,he isnt obligated to provide food for children that are not his nor should anyone try to guilt him into doing so
SA_lLbwO4s8,you know it really blew up and its a serious case when even shaq had to react
SA_lLbwO4s8,im so glad i didnt have kids with a woman like this god damn
SA_lLbwO4s8,me personally i 100 agree with the guy his child his duty his child support the others may be his kids siblings but where they daddies at
SA_lLbwO4s8,my biggest issue with this in particular and the toxic pettiness adults display towards each other truly only hurt the children involved
SA_lLbwO4s8,this actually makes me feel better about my baby mama situation  my bm is just like this makes me feel good knowing im not alone
SA_lLbwO4s8,first of all manner of approach is everything
SA_lLbwO4s8,he did the right thing in my mind hes responsible for his child and only his child not her other kids
SA_lLbwO4s8,i thought you was gonna disappoint me at first my boy but you kept it
SA_lLbwO4s8,knowing how these situations work out from personal experience i feel bad for the son theres a chance shes taking it out on his kid
SA_lLbwO4s8,when she threw it on the ground that fucking hurt  props to the dad for keeping cool and collected
SA_lLbwO4s8,it makes me so sad as a man that people like this mom exist
SA_lLbwO4s8,yall already know theres enough to be said about this and whos in the rightwrong so to sum it up i just hope he gets full custody
SA_lLbwO4s8,is daddy coming today
SA_lLbwO4s8,lol she even said he comes everyday lol he ballin on her everyday
SA_lLbwO4s8,the child thats mine silly
SA_lLbwO4s8,okay so let my son come out to the car and eat
SA_lLbwO4s8,i was going to cry in the shower but watching this video is much more important
SA_lLbwO4s8,you make everyones day shaq you got the best reactions
SA_lLbwO4s8,words cant explain how crazy this is man he has one child and thats his responsibility nothing else matter
SA_lLbwO4s8,i dont know how he didnt spaz out when she threw the food on the ground
SA_lLbwO4s8,dig seeing you switch it up with this reaction killed it as usual shaq
SA_lLbwO4s8,if he pays child support hes already helping with her kids and she still expecting more
SA_lLbwO4s8,what he shouldve said was where are those kids dad at so they can bring them food like the dude a good dad taking care of his kid
SA_lLbwO4s8,i hope she watches this video to see that its her vs everybody lmao
SA_lLbwO4s8,even in your fame i see you come from humble beginnings i really appreciate your look on life bruh you a good dude
SA_lLbwO4s8,this video  it reminds me of the yays and nays of universal government like healthcare free college etc
SA_lLbwO4s8,when i was just a little baby boy my momma used to tell me these crazy things
SA_lLbwO4s8,throwing that meal in the street says it all about her
SA_lLbwO4s8,she should be thankful he a real one actually trying and taking care of his kid and stepping up respect to him
SA_lLbwO4s8,this is amazing of her  she recorded good evidence to the court for him to take his child with him  she cant support herself let alone other children
SA_lLbwO4s8,at the end of the day hes taking care of his and thats all that matters she better call them other kids daddies
SA_lLbwO4s8,that aint got nothing to do with him hes doing what hes gotta do for his own hes a good dad
yLMGzih8CSE,hey chaps if you could add 1 feature to the xps 15  what would it be for me 90 or 120hz refresh
yLMGzih8CSE,i bought this laptop for an av tech on our site i went with the
yLMGzih8CSE,thank you for this review i always appreciate your reviews you always upload quality content and quality reviews of laptops
yLMGzih8CSE,cool features and all really love how fast and sleek it is
yLMGzih8CSE,great review im dissapointed with the lack of real world improvements over last gens model
yLMGzih8CSE,the only significant refresh compared to 2021s model was the price
yLMGzih8CSE,16 120hz oled wouldnt mind if it was a bit thicker also for better temps and performance and better gpu
yLMGzih8CSE,especially seeing where asus and lenovo are this year i think dell really dropped the ball this year in terms of innovation
yLMGzih8CSE,please let there be a design upgrade with the xps 15 plus next yearthat xps 13 plus just looks sooo clean
yLMGzih8CSE,i love the 13 plus design however i really want a 17inch xps
yLMGzih8CSE,im looking forward to see the xps 13 video nice video with plenty contrast looks like the videos production is getting better already great
yLMGzih8CSE,that extra battery life settles my debates on what laptop to get im getting one of these with the oled screen seems awesome
yLMGzih8CSE,just got mine and i absolutely love this thing the picture quality is truly incredible
yLMGzih8CSE,well made video as always and good recommendations 
yLMGzih8CSE,you are the best love your quality and the way you explain every tiny detailyou should have 10million subs
yLMGzih8CSE,excellent review mate still there aint no chance that im buying another dell just a few more weeks until the m2 air is available
yLMGzih8CSE,question is the trackpad on the the 15 better than the xps 13  i find the xps 13 trackpad not fit for purpose great channel by the way
yLMGzih8CSE,hey tom are you planning on doing the new xps 13  xps 13 plus reviews also great job on this xps 15 review appreciate it cheers
yLMGzih8CSE,i would have loved to see premiere and resolve benchmarks versus 9510
yLMGzih8CSE,they should make an xps 16 with a
yLMGzih8CSE,dear my brother
yLMGzih8CSE,i wish you went more into how many of these laptops have issues with the build or software and other things that arent acceptable
yLMGzih8CSE,i am still using dell xps 15 9550 best performance no compromise i love it
yLMGzih8CSE,always great content sir i want to see intel 13 gen and rtx 4090 first in your channel
yLMGzih8CSE,in terms of performance and cost what is your opinion between this and the zephyrus g1415
yLMGzih8CSE,if only i could afford one im still on a full spec xps 15 from about ten years ago
yLMGzih8CSE,xps should be allamd especially with 6th gen u with 6xxxs is a perfect for ultrabook
yLMGzih8CSE,mac air with m2 seems like a good rival here could please you also make some review about mac air m2 with the best configuration of xps 15 thank you
yLMGzih8CSE,waiting for the dell xps 13 plus review
yLMGzih8CSE,the new design of the xps 13 is likely to have the same fate as the macbooks touch bar
yLMGzih8CSE,the m1 mac would be an instabuy for me if it natively supported engineering software damn shame really
yLMGzih8CSE,i love dell product than other asian laptop product
yLMGzih8CSE,im surprised just how far ahead apple is with their laptops probably years to be honest
yLMGzih8CSE,cant decide between the 9520 and the xps 13 plus would prefer more performance but the plus looks a lot nicer
yLMGzih8CSE,i really wish dell wouldnt stop offering fhd to low or 4k to overkill 1440p should be the base
yLMGzih8CSE,great video will there be a video on the dell xps 13 the new blue one 
yLMGzih8CSE,dells years of incompetence in regards to their trackpads the motto should be if it is broke dont fix it
yLMGzih8CSE,big plus for oled screen
yLMGzih8CSE,most expensive laptops from high to low
yLMGzih8CSE,i really dont know why these dont come with ryzen processors cant be the only one who thinks this would run better on them
yLMGzih8CSE,waiting for your review of the new xps 13 9315
yLMGzih8CSE,hey tom just wondering if you were going to do a review of the dell xps 13 plus as you did mention it on new laptops of 2022
yLMGzih8CSE,i have last years model sitting right next to me as i watch this video and the fan is on full blast
yLMGzih8CSE,is 14 inch laptops good 
yLMGzih8CSE,i want the new m2 macbook air but i basically need a 15 inch laptop at this pointso im looking at the possibility of a windows laptop
yLMGzih8CSE,wish i could afford the xps 17
yLMGzih8CSE,what is the best competition  alternative to the dell xps 9520
yLMGzih8CSE,is dell xps 15 better than m1 max for programming
yLMGzih8CSE,the only positive thing is that you can bay it immediatly on dell site while the asus is very difficult to find especcially in italy where i live
yLMGzih8CSE,hi  love your reviews  please make a review of the new lenovo yoga slim 7 xpro 2022 the amd version
yLMGzih8CSE,asus has much better choice with high end oled panel and higher performance
yLMGzih8CSE,hey tech chap what in ur opinion is a good engineer laptop today
yLMGzih8CSE,dont get the xps 13 like i did the ram isnt expandable sadly only on the xps 15
yLMGzih8CSE,3050ti is a disgrace for that beautiful oled panel
yLMGzih8CSE,i just cant accept the 5060 series gpus that they keep putting in these things for the money theyre asking for
yLMGzih8CSE,60hz display absolutely laughable oh how the tables have turned versus apple
yLMGzih8CSE,hello qualcomm has all the same benefits as apple except performance heat management is on point no fans is on point battery is on point
yLMGzih8CSE,i too went from the xps 15 to the m1 max i wont be returning anytime soon the apple is just amazing
yLMGzih8CSE,thank goodness for windows devices dont think the apple fascination can support all these reviewers

bj_M6w_LGgw,the best thing this video confirmed was how awesome the stormtroopers that work at disney are
bj_M6w_LGgw,nick you gotta collab with gordon when you pass him in subs
2dbupGVu0As,im always amazed at matpats calm and collected demeanor on his videos and then unscripted matpat is unleashed and i get why hes usually contained within a script
2dbupGVu0As,matpat without a script just improvising is my new favorite thing hes just completely unhinged with his dadpat jokes
2dbupGVu0As,i hope mat knows that he will forever be quoted
2dbupGVu0As,as a professional regular everyday factory worker the different patterns on the cookies is probably just a residual pattern left behind from the conveyor belt when they get made
2dbupGVu0As,matpat that was a mistake
2dbupGVu0As,this episode is just matpat slowly losing his mind and i love it hes so different when hes unscripted and its great to see his true personality come out more
2dbupGVu0As,there are really three different ways of separating an oreo from its cream
2dbupGVu0As,always think before you speak
2dbupGVu0As,i love how you always reference your older episodes it really brings home the fact that youre growing a family and community here on the theorist channels
2dbupGVu0As,new food theory does tomato soup actually get rid of skunk smell the science behind it what other foods would get rid of it
2dbupGVu0As,and im like awww look at that thick layer of cream in there i want that thickness inside b
2dbupGVu0As,ive long said oreo needs to make a new flavor called you stuff with the middle column being the cream and the outside columns being just cookies
2dbupGVu0As,20 seconds in and mat already had a pause moment
2dbupGVu0As,couchpats humor in this episode was spot on xdd first episode thats made me uncontrollably laugh outloud in a while would love to see more like this
2dbupGVu0As,so for just academic research matt how much stuf can you stuff on your cookie before it legally stops being a cookie for academic research of course
2dbupGVu0As,a team of aerospace engineers noticed that with regular oreos the stuff always seems to stick to one side
2dbupGVu0As,i am now convinced that before publishing the statement that double stuff are in fact double the oreo company began assuring a higher level of consistency between oreos
2dbupGVu0As,i have always liked the wafers over the cream finally i understand why ive always found the thins and minis more enjoyable for me
2dbupGVu0As,i prefer golden oreos not a fan of the chocolate cookie part of the oreo  but i do like mint oreos but i love mint and chocolate together
2dbupGVu0As,im almost 50 years old and i can tell you for certainty
2dbupGVu0As,i love these descent into madness episodes hope they arent too mentally taxing though
2dbupGVu0As,double stuf is the way to go i got so used to them regular ones felt so thin
2dbupGVu0As,i was eating oreos and then trying the hinge joint technique i perfectly seperated the cream from the chocolate
2dbupGVu0As,one of college classes we did this we averaged 23 times the stuff as regular so more than double the stuff
2dbupGVu0As,the double stuffed has long been the original oreo its where companies are giving you less for the same price
2dbupGVu0As,i love it when matpat calls back his other videos or just have a hydrox instead
2dbupGVu0As,i want that thickness inside my bod
2dbupGVu0As,i think freezing would be an easier method of removing the cream that way the cream gets more solid and less sticky so the wafer should come off easier
2dbupGVu0As,watching this just reminded me i have oreo thins tiramisu and oreo chocolate mints unopened still in the pantry thanks matpat i want some oreo now
2dbupGVu0As,loved this
2dbupGVu0As,i never heard of golden oreos ive seen a vanilla flavored one though
2dbupGVu0As,i was definitely thinking of moisture adding weight wouldnt melting it in do the same as you called me out d
2dbupGVu0As,i once bought double stuf oreos big scam there wasnt even any additional stuff probably an extremely thin layer and thats it
2dbupGVu0As,something ive recently seen you can get the cream easily off the cookie when youre using a vacuum chamber
2dbupGVu0As,we did this experiment in ap biology and it came out close to three times as much and we used precise weighing machines
2dbupGVu0As,as much as i like the cream eating it makes my tongue feel numb so i honestly cant eat a lot of oreos generally even less the double stuff ones
2dbupGVu0As,did you try freezing them to get the cream off
2dbupGVu0As,i think that they had a limited time oreo a bit ago called the most stuf oreo where it was just an absurd amount of creme between the chocolate
2dbupGVu0As,omg its a miracle i wanted oreos while watching this and i found double stuf i have never found double stuf here in australia finally i get to try them
2dbupGVu0As,i tested both oreos for a biology thing at the starting of the year they are not double stuffed as they advertise it as
2dbupGVu0As,a vacuum chamber is really good at separating the cream from the cookie it is kind of expensive though
2dbupGVu0As,matt you couldve just used a vacuum chamber to easily and more accurately separate the cream from the cookie
2dbupGVu0As,id say my favorite oreos are the golden and the thins the thins are like the perfect amount of oreo per oreo to me and the golden just taste amazing
2dbupGVu0As,all i hear is steph  you just wanted to eat oreos didnt you
2dbupGVu0As,i feel like this could be solved just by comparing the weight of each package
2dbupGVu0As,duuude the double stuff are just the regular oreos from my childhood the
2dbupGVu0As,im surprised that they never put the oreos in the fridge its the best way to get the cream perfectly off the cookie redo the test
2dbupGVu0As,if only they knew of the canonical greatest version of oreo the extra stuff thin oreo
2dbupGVu0As,the intro i finished it in my head lol that was hilarious
2dbupGVu0As,i want that thickness inside my body  matpat
2dbupGVu0As,the best way to completely separate the cookie from the filling is with a vacuum chamber im sure you have one just lying around there
2dbupGVu0As,this also means we can figure out which type offers the best value pricewise ie total amount of cookie mass per 
2dbupGVu0As,im honestly surprised there isnt already just the cream sold separately like nutella or marshmellow fluff
2dbupGVu0As,i remember a video from action labs he used a vaccum chamber to perfectly separate the cream from the cookie
2dbupGVu0As,matpat is like me when scripted we are calm but when we lack a script we go wild
2dbupGVu0As,im curious why no one thought of freezing dehydrating or the ultimate freeze drying to separate the cream and cookie
2dbupGVu0As,you can use a vacuum chamber to split the cream from the cookies perfectly
2dbupGVu0As,new food theory is the this is food drink actually food could be interesting since you already look at a food to survive on for the rest of your life
2dbupGVu0As,i never thought that matpat without a script just slowly descending into madness was something i actually needed
2dbupGVu0As,i like this new gtlivexnormalfoodtheory format with mat in the studio and also edited its fun to watch

YjP7jbtX_ZM,preston says im gonna make an octagon
YjP7jbtX_ZM,lets talk about the fact that the person that works for him hes actually giving only as
YjP7jbtX_ZM,imagine bri was actully an pro artist and made everything she drew really realistic
YjP7jbtX_ZM,even when preston is in pain he still enjoys it and laughs it off
YjP7jbtX_ZM,10 seconds in and i already laughed my socks off love it
YjP7jbtX_ZM,i love how zhc uses just as and fs to grade them 
YjP7jbtX_ZM,just wait until he gets rejected by said art school im sure nothing will go wrong 
YjP7jbtX_ZM,yes finally i was waiting for this collab
YjP7jbtX_ZM,well i mean if you hold the scissors like that
YjP7jbtX_ZM,i just love how theres a zhc challenge video just going in the background

YjP7jbtX_ZM,i love all of their drawings there so cute
YjP7jbtX_ZM,has no one noticed they were filming an art challenge for zach as well as a video for preston i luv how they always work together 3
YjP7jbtX_ZM,does anyone else realize zach only does as and fs for a grade lol
YjP7jbtX_ZM,i think that in the back izzy jaz jake michelle joy and zach and i think kenzie were doing the sprinkle art challenge
YjP7jbtX_ZM,i love how he doesnt give any grade between a and f
YjP7jbtX_ZM,i love how their just filming 2 videos at once
YjP7jbtX_ZM,preston asks girls did you take my paint
YjP7jbtX_ZM,i watched most likely all of zhcs videos he is an amazing artist
YjP7jbtX_ZM,zhc you have 5 minutes any questions
YjP7jbtX_ZM,yo i literally subscribed just because youre friends with zhc so say thank you to him lol
YjP7jbtX_ZM,preston was very happy when michelle got f and finally he got a for the first time

YjP7jbtX_ZM,now bri now knows what its like to give brith when she does
YjP7jbtX_ZM,whats so weird is that zach only gave fs and as
YjP7jbtX_ZM,when he launched the beads and called him mean i literally died
YjP7jbtX_ZM,yall just got an awesome concept again
YjP7jbtX_ZM,this collaboration is fire
YjP7jbtX_ZM,when bree decides to give me children thats my child  wise men
YjP7jbtX_ZM,the part that made me laugh is when bri said are you ok
YjP7jbtX_ZM,that one moment when nobody knew what to do when preston freaked other than bri cuz shes probably used to it
YjP7jbtX_ZM,i love how zachs team is at the back
YjP7jbtX_ZM,i cant get over the fact that preston said  ah you turned on the birther
YjP7jbtX_ZM,i wont judge biasly also zhc i mean how your holding the gives a
YjP7jbtX_ZM,love prestons videos they r funny and entertaining
YjP7jbtX_ZM,preston won

YjP7jbtX_ZM,can we just appreciate how big you have grown since your first vid
YjP7jbtX_ZM,zhc is the only youtuber that i know that has made the most collabs with people
YjP7jbtX_ZM,i like them so much preston is so funny
YjP7jbtX_ZM,soooo this school only gives as and fs thats just not fair to bs cs ds and es and zs
YjP7jbtX_ZM,is it just me or would it be entertaining to watch preston and brianna try and evade a bounty hunter
YjP7jbtX_ZM,zach knows there are other grades besides a  f right
YjP7jbtX_ZM,i like how there is a challenge going on in the back round
YjP7jbtX_ZM,i love watching your videos they are so funny
YjP7jbtX_ZM,can we realize that prestons marker fell through the table in the one line challenge
YjP7jbtX_ZM,i love how briana said patata

bqPyokUFNpY,ive never seen a table before thats some pretty cool technology
bqPyokUFNpY,oh god linus and lukes shenanigans actually had me rolling yes more luke on ltt please
bqPyokUFNpY,dan is the perfect dad to linus the looks comments etc would make a fun spinoff on linus ideas
bqPyokUFNpY,to give dan more of the credit for the success of this video i also have tables in my house
bqPyokUFNpY,only linus and ltt guys could make a moving stuff video that i watched giggling and also didnt regret the lost time from my life
bqPyokUFNpY,lol i guess we all love dan ive seen him a bunch in recent videos and im so here for it
bqPyokUFNpY,linus multimillionaire with a vast media empire backing him recently purchased a 2 mil home with over millions in upgrades and renovations
bqPyokUFNpY,more luke please its great to see linus and luke messing around
bqPyokUFNpY,the editing and the way he presents all this is so good give him a jooh wait
bqPyokUFNpY,dan is so chill and lovable 
bqPyokUFNpY,imagine just starting to work for a company being put in front of the camera and then the thousands of viewers are like we want more of him
bqPyokUFNpY,carpenters  measure twice cut once
bqPyokUFNpY,i too am a proud owner of a table how very nice of dan to ask for such a detail
bqPyokUFNpY,can not wait to see moving day 30 and pay off that house keep scraping the bottom of the barrel
bqPyokUFNpY,i can confirm that i do indeed have a table in my house
bqPyokUFNpY,wow i have a table too and i moved a few times such relatable content 
bqPyokUFNpY,imagine you get hired and one of the first thing you have to do is help your boss move
bqPyokUFNpY,linus who let one rip
bqPyokUFNpY,i have a table in my house dan thank you for asking it has a leaf too
P5AZOFL8DLE,seek help
P5AZOFL8DLE,finally a day where sam doesnt have to take out the skull of his enemy
P5AZOFL8DLE,some people get therapy for ocd intrusive thoughts others monetize it
P5AZOFL8DLE,my worst fear is sweating hours over how hard it is to draw hands only for sam to say at least try
P5AZOFL8DLE,we know there aint a roast video without someone needing to be told to seek help becauseee we are unhinged like that
P5AZOFL8DLE,thrift store picachu
P5AZOFL8DLE,i feel like at this point people are drawing sinister stuff just to see sams blood pressure skyrocket
P5AZOFL8DLE,not me screaming oh my god after sam said she looks so unimpressed could she be looking at your drawing process
P5AZOFL8DLE,i was literally melting under the sun and now i can at least melt happily while watching your video thanks sam
P5AZOFL8DLE,sam why are artists so disturbed
P5AZOFL8DLE,sam i wanna see like just flowing i wanna se things like just blowing in the wind i wanna see chaos and fire and death
P5AZOFL8DLE,imagine sam like taking out the entire bone structure of his enemy one day

K6knVq8OfgY,i dont think these inflated prices will ever come down  companies will just consider them the new norm
K6knVq8OfgY,my fertilizer cost for 250 acre of corn went from 34000 to 82000 not 30 percent like you stated
K6knVq8OfgY,its crazy depending so much on a huge system for food those of us who can need to grow more of our own more local farms and support them
K6knVq8OfgY,i like how its all blamed on the pandemic and war how about all the recent fires in food manufacturing plants whats really going on here
K6knVq8OfgY,lets also not forget food packaging is subtly shrinking while prices go up
K6knVq8OfgY,every day it feels like we are closer to the end
K6knVq8OfgY,if food shortages occur around the world just imagine how that will increase the numbers of people trying to enter into the us and canada across the borders
K6knVq8OfgY,even if we the united states of america face a food shortage im confident most of us have some extra calories in our mid section
K6knVq8OfgY,i remember when us farmers were destroying billions of crops corn wheatmilkgreens now they face a food shortage irony
K6knVq8OfgY,were already well into a food shortage have you seen the expiration dates of canned food on the shelves
K6knVq8OfgY,if only we had leadership that cared about us more than the southern border
K6knVq8OfgY,see its ridiculous to believe that one country that got invaded can destroy the food chain that just dont seem right in my opinion
K6knVq8OfgY,look how people act on black friday imagine if theres actually a food shortage
K6knVq8OfgY,since us food wastage is 25 on avg this may be the golden opportunity for americans to achieve zero wastage for once
K6knVq8OfgY,experts say that exporting your food and draining the food supply of your country will only have positive consequences
K6knVq8OfgY,if you have means to do so
K6knVq8OfgY,this is why i started growing my own vegetables and fruitsi also make my own bread at homeand biscuits from scratch
K6knVq8OfgY,we need to grow wheat not soybeans government needs to help farmers with seed to make it happen if farmers arent doing good nobody is doing good
K6knVq8OfgY,lest we forget that
K6knVq8OfgY,yes and it will be severe for the lower income wage earners and the citizens living on their fixed incomes
K6knVq8OfgY,the economy shuts down for 2 years while people sit at home collecting pay checks this is what happens recession is here as a result of the policies implemented
K6knVq8OfgY,yesterday i went grocery shopping i got like 16 itemsit was 145 dollars i look at the receipt damn products did went up
K6knVq8OfgY,ive never been so proud to be obese my fat reserves will give me a good chance go through this crisis
K6knVq8OfgY,time to start supporting american farmers
K6knVq8OfgY,increased fuel costs to deliver the food to the stores are passed onto the consumers
K6knVq8OfgY,the only grocery store that has shortages is walmart
K6knVq8OfgY,forgot to mention the food manufacturers places blowing up on wednesday and thursdays coincidentally
K6knVq8OfgY,dont believe these people because we can already see the food shortages in america all you have to do is go into your local grocery store
K6knVq8OfgY,not to mention that the monsanto company has basically taken over the wolds food supply
K6knVq8OfgY,lucky the government failed to initiate efforts that would have start the take over of massive amount of local land and food producing capacity into corporate hands
K6knVq8OfgY,its what happens when you burn down food processing plants and pay farmers to destroy crops weird right
K6knVq8OfgY,once enough of us start starving well just eat the rich
K6knVq8OfgY,those denying that were not gonna be affected is  in my opinion saying the same thing as politicians that said we wont have inflation
K6knVq8OfgY,blaming it on the boogyman virus are we
K6knVq8OfgY,i dont think theres a shortage there was just an over abundance prior to covid food waste wasis out of control
K6knVq8OfgY,it amazes me how many people have no idea where our food comes from
K6knVq8OfgY,grow food and get what needed to store
K6knVq8OfgY,start learning how to grow your own food we need to get together as communities again and start relying on each other in our own communities
K6knVq8OfgY,thanks joe another great job
K6knVq8OfgY,costs havent just gone up for us theyve gone up for farmers too and those expenses are passed along to the consumer
K6knVq8OfgY,and so far there have been 20 food processing plants have caught on fire whats up with that
K6knVq8OfgY,boa noite
K6knVq8OfgY,same thing as in the past something happens we the people pay the price
K6knVq8OfgY,proud montana state alum happy to see our university participating in important conversations like this
K6knVq8OfgY,its about time thats all i can say
K6knVq8OfgY,we got thousands and thousands of acres of land here and nothings growing on it problem solved
K6knVq8OfgY,john 635 then jesus declared i am the bread of life whoever comes to me will never go hungry and whoever believes in me will never be thirsty
K6knVq8OfgY,what about the food and fertilizer factories warehouses and processing plants that have caught fire recently in the united states
K6knVq8OfgY,lets get some antitrust laws into action
K6knVq8OfgY,stop blaming this on ukraine this was all by design everything from the pandemic to this is all a major distraction keep prepping and brace yourselves
K6knVq8OfgY,if every country would be selfsustaining and grow organic on own starvation would be minimized
K6knVq8OfgY,great  now i have to pay for this too  i love this global economy plan
K6knVq8OfgY,this is sugar coated food shortages are inevitable and theyre closer than you think
K6knVq8OfgY,households need to start using vertical farming techniques to grow some of their food
K6knVq8OfgY,love how the media focuses on the negative instead of how we should grow domestic organic food and move to renewable energy sources
K6knVq8OfgY,if rumors start getting around about this you think the toilet paper shortage was bad
K6knVq8OfgY,time to eat locally grown food which will be good for the environment and pocket friendly
K6knVq8OfgY,shortages been happening since the pandemic 2020

OlnUxUvZVHE,there was a dwight impersonator and a jim impersonator a strong man crushed a turtle
OlnUxUvZVHE,this is a stupid activity i would be embarrassed to be good at it
OlnUxUvZVHE,they shouldve just let creed summarize every episode so we can take a peek at creed thoughts
OlnUxUvZVHE,i like how the warehouse workers just ignore dwight building a contraption
OlnUxUvZVHE,the moment she steps off this bar ill be launched into space lmaooooo
OlnUxUvZVHE,i love how this is a peak into the bizarre surreal way creed sees the world on a daily basis
OlnUxUvZVHE,i love how seamlessly dwight flips over
OlnUxUvZVHE,i love how creed only needs a few lines and a couple of seconds to steal the show
OlnUxUvZVHE,copier did tricks on highwire
OlnUxUvZVHE,seeing dwight fall over and over has me dying lmao
OlnUxUvZVHE,this is perfect one of my favorite episodes
OlnUxUvZVHE,balls and face anyone not listening to what clarks saying is missing out on something truly special his delivery style is a masterpiece
OlnUxUvZVHE,even though they got it under control the fact that kevin was reaching out to catch dwight anyway is a nice little detail
OlnUxUvZVHE,dwight falling and cutting his mouth is so funny
OlnUxUvZVHE,love this show so much just finished it yesterday for a second time and loved it
OlnUxUvZVHE,this show is gonna be really popular i can feel it
OlnUxUvZVHE,i love creed so much he just gave me my first laugh of the day
OlnUxUvZVHE,no one gives dwight credit for even trying and getting hurt in the process kudos to him
OlnUxUvZVHE,time thief time thief fire him  dwight youve really never stolen any company time  never
OlnUxUvZVHE,impressive dwight hang onto the handle bar after it flipped and held on until the fire truck arrived amazing gripping strength
OlnUxUvZVHE,i didnt notice the first time i watched this but they say you only live once and im about to prove it is so funny
OlnUxUvZVHE,andy grew to be an absolute madlad after that trip
OlnUxUvZVHE,it was all dwight in this scene but then creed came and took the cake
OlnUxUvZVHE,i was scratching my head the entire time wondering why the clip had this title and then creed cleared it all up for me at the end
OlnUxUvZVHE,season 9 wasnt good but clark was a pretty good addition
OlnUxUvZVHE,they said that you only live once and im about to prove it
OlnUxUvZVHE,kevins timing and perfection on reacting to things going on is just hilarious
OlnUxUvZVHE,this is the most that i have laughed at dwight and his schemes simply awesome
OlnUxUvZVHE,the third manager to loathe toby michael may be gone but his disdain is very much still present
OlnUxUvZVHE,dwight sure came a long way from caring about company property
OlnUxUvZVHE,nothing good ever happens when dwight or michael end up on the roof of the dunder mifflin building
OlnUxUvZVHE,dwight just doesnt give up super persistent
OlnUxUvZVHE,creed is the life i would want when working in an office
OlnUxUvZVHE,i laughed and i cried
OlnUxUvZVHE,creed is both ancient and bugeyes youthful at the same time xd
OlnUxUvZVHE,imagine if dwight actually made it to the other side
OlnUxUvZVHE,dwight is so funny
OlnUxUvZVHE,dwightwe weigh about the same
OlnUxUvZVHE,creeds comments saved this clip from the dumpster i laughed and i cried creeds reality is fascinating
OlnUxUvZVHE,dwight said the moment phyliss steps off the bar then hell be launched into space
OlnUxUvZVHE,that moment even jim is horrified by how much blood dwight drewfrom himself
OlnUxUvZVHE,its so funny how pam knows its dwight
OlnUxUvZVHE,michael almost proved you can only live once
OlnUxUvZVHE,i want a compilation of dwight just saying idiot
OlnUxUvZVHE,hate to imagine what wouldve happened if pam went along with dwights request
OlnUxUvZVHE,who else wishes they could be there when dwight did the homemade tightrope
OlnUxUvZVHE,they say you only live once and im about to prove it
OlnUxUvZVHE,how did dwight hold that long until the fire brigade arrived my arms would have gone numb after 90 seconds
OlnUxUvZVHE,dwight jr is an underrated character
OlnUxUvZVHE,creed convinced everyone is an impersonator or lookalike
OlnUxUvZVHE,when i first saw dwight attempt this i first thought ok so when he gets to the telephone pole then what
OlnUxUvZVHE,creeds outro priceless
OlnUxUvZVHE,they say you only live once and i am about to prove it   yup pretty accurate and lowkey the funniest missed line of the clip missed slackline
OlnUxUvZVHE,the moment she steps off this bar ill be launched into space
OlnUxUvZVHE,you can tell its a stunt double in the thumbnail lol
OlnUxUvZVHE,creed is def the best character
OlnUxUvZVHE,the office without steve carrell is like a steak without the beef
OlnUxUvZVHE,thank you dwight
OlnUxUvZVHE,they say you only live once and ill prove it
OlnUxUvZVHE,let me show you how a real man walks across a flaccid cord
OlnUxUvZVHE,toby this is a bloodbath
OlnUxUvZVHE,the use of creed in this show is just
OlnUxUvZVHE,dont know why creeds lines hit me so hard
OlnUxUvZVHE,biggest mystery of the show how the hell did creed get his job
OlnUxUvZVHE,for the record clark made dwight do this so i blame him
OlnUxUvZVHE,obviously it flipped over because it wasnt heavy enough but what was his plan i dont see a way he doesnt bike right into powerlines even if he made it
OlnUxUvZVHE,haha dwight tries to catch the precious paper as it falls out of the printer
OlnUxUvZVHE,if we can see the world through the mind of creed then everyday would be an adventure
OlnUxUvZVHE,creed a strong man crushed a turtle
OlnUxUvZVHE,dwight held on for a long time
OlnUxUvZVHE,pam when she asked dwight if he was 105 lbs was adorable
OlnUxUvZVHE,its not a race dwight
OlnUxUvZVHE,dwight holds onto those handlebars for over 5 minutes just absolutely ridiculous shrute upper body strength at work
OlnUxUvZVHE,you may find this hard to believe but i love my boring life lol
OlnUxUvZVHE,creed one of the quabity assuance of a dog food company
OlnUxUvZVHE,you cut the part where andy push nellie down from the ropei love that part cause i hate nellie so much at those times
OlnUxUvZVHE,use kevin as the counterweight it will actually work
OlnUxUvZVHE,god why is dwight so easily threatened
OlnUxUvZVHE,i mean dwight didnt lie that is how a good 85 of men would walk on a rope
OlnUxUvZVHE,creed is just unpredictable
OlnUxUvZVHE,dwight might run this scene but creed is the star
OlnUxUvZVHE,im convinced that dwight tried to open that locked door was not on the script
OlnUxUvZVHE,i liked that they show dwight stunt double in the thumbnail
OlnUxUvZVHE,you got to considered that he hang in  there for several minutes what is deam impressive one athletic guy could only hold for like 3 minutes
OlnUxUvZVHE,thats one of the most hateful version of andy even worst than wall punching non sense andy he was so selfish those times

XcrFwgDUV9E,it would be cool to have a public version of this that features the same objects in java edition that would go great on servers
XcrFwgDUV9E,this actually looks really great for mapmakers id love to play around with this
XcrFwgDUV9E,these are available in bedrock 1160 npc spawn egg allow deny border chalkboard and camera for camera you need to inventory edit same with chalkboard portfolio was never implemented
XcrFwgDUV9E,you forgot to mention that you can edit the new signs once you place them which is a lot better than signs
XcrFwgDUV9E,board would be a cool expansion to the sign imagine an editable sign that is 3x2 blocks rather than just the 1
XcrFwgDUV9E,many cool things that need to be in the javaedition like a tutorial world blackboards or just the camera for making custom pictures for decoration d
XcrFwgDUV9E,anyone else thinks that normal mc needs an npc spawn egg
XcrFwgDUV9E,in 116
XcrFwgDUV9E,most people have probably never seen before
XcrFwgDUV9E,now that this is on bedrock its actually quite good for map making with the npcs and stuff
XcrFwgDUV9E,i found that allow block in 116 with the experiment option in bedrock
XcrFwgDUV9E,i hope that windows 10 edition will make it so you can pick between the block being highlighted or outlined
XcrFwgDUV9E,ive actually heard that some schools arewill be using this 
XcrFwgDUV9E,some of this stuff would be perfect for java the allow and deny blocks would be great
XcrFwgDUV9E,our teacher accidentally started a survival world it went from education edition to 2b2t fast
XcrFwgDUV9E,previously in mcpe the item camera can be accessed through some sort of give commandbut doesnt have the feature to capture pictures instead they will summon lightning where they stand
XcrFwgDUV9E,combine the items and blocks from educational edition into a mod so you can use the mod in official minecraft
XcrFwgDUV9E,fun fact we can get the npc egg with a command give s spawnegg 1 51
XcrFwgDUV9E,those cameras are so interesting would be cool to have them in regular minecraft to take pictures of your world and hang them on your walls
XcrFwgDUV9E,the fact that education edition turned into a bedrock edition of the game 
XcrFwgDUV9E,camera should be added in every minecraft versions
XcrFwgDUV9E,i like how the tutorial teaches teachers at a play level lower than most children even start
XcrFwgDUV9E,i wish there were bigger sized signs in regular minecraft it would be so helpful
XcrFwgDUV9E,you can change the highlighted blocks in settings
XcrFwgDUV9E,all of this needs to be in vanilla minecraft those npcs could be nice for story themed minecraft worlds those billboards too and those three building blocks are sweet too
XcrFwgDUV9E,the allow and deny block is also available in pocket edition
XcrFwgDUV9E,they should introduce cameras and portfolios in vanilla minecraft
XcrFwgDUV9E,they used to have cameras in pocket edition and still do but they can only be accessed through inventory editing to give a spawn egg for a camera
XcrFwgDUV9E,im so happy my teacher lets us play this yes we use this in school
XcrFwgDUV9E,dude this looks awesome this needs to be released as a way to create adventure maps that would be so cool loved the video
XcrFwgDUV9E,fact you can get the education edition in the pocketbedrock edition create world menu
XcrFwgDUV9E,there was also minecraft edu which is more like the original minecraft not in the windows 10 style
XcrFwgDUV9E,they need some of these features in normal minecraft especially for map makers or roleplayers
XcrFwgDUV9E,i like how they teach kids that throwing your gold into a well doesnt bring good luck
XcrFwgDUV9E,the camera is actually in the item ids for mcpe ive spawned it in through additional apps but it doesnt do anything though
XcrFwgDUV9E,i would love to see more minecraft ee videos keep on the good work log
XcrFwgDUV9E,actually almost every bedrock player knows about education edition its basically a feature in a world that you can toggle on and off
XcrFwgDUV9E,i used this version at minecon 2016 it sure was interesting and cool to try out
XcrFwgDUV9E,npc spawn egg allow border and deny is already in bedrock edition
XcrFwgDUV9E,definitely asking my principal to do this
XcrFwgDUV9E,you can change the block setting so the block has a border around it not a highlighted block in the settings
XcrFwgDUV9E,the big white board would be fun and good to use in builds in regular version of mc
XcrFwgDUV9E,border block and allowdisable block is in bedrock nomarly also education edition can be normally accessed through bedrock
XcrFwgDUV9E,love your video easy to understandfunny and keeps my kids attention education edition is great for todays learning environment
XcrFwgDUV9E,we used minecraft education edition for our architecture unit once it was really fun
XcrFwgDUV9E,i tried this in school my class was one of the beta testers we all played it we do it still every week
XcrFwgDUV9E,mcpe actually had the camera back in 080 and you could get it through an inventory editor but it was removed
XcrFwgDUV9E,did you know those cameras were going to be the way to actually take photos in minecraft but they scrapped it
XcrFwgDUV9E,the camera and portfolio need to be added to the other editions of minecraft its so much cooler than just taking a screenshot
XcrFwgDUV9E,npcs need to be in vanilla
XcrFwgDUV9E,i wish they added the signs in this version in normal minecraft cause i got some amazing map ideas to create
XcrFwgDUV9E,i hope all schools are gonna get this it would be so funny learning with minecraft
XcrFwgDUV9E,i think they should add that tutorial world with the game not as a world but more as a mode which you can toggle on and off in the settings
XcrFwgDUV9E,in the bedrock edition there is an option in the create a world menu where you can turn on edu edition
XcrFwgDUV9E,in windows it is not always highlighted i have mine outlined you just need to go to settings
XcrFwgDUV9E,i feel this would be great for the kids who have trouble focusing in normal classes and just have general learning struggles
XcrFwgDUV9E,didnt the camera used to be on pocket edition in its earlier years
XcrFwgDUV9E,i wish they had those big signs in the original minecraft it would be cool to make billboards or something
XcrFwgDUV9E,there is a secret camera file in pe
XcrFwgDUV9E,you know there is that education edition toggle you can switch on
XcrFwgDUV9E,the camera and portfolio must be in the normal version aswell it cool for playing adventure maps or just as a book where you store pictures of you getting atchievements
XcrFwgDUV9E,another thing you can do with npc is create command buttons
XcrFwgDUV9E,my school needs
XcrFwgDUV9E,there were already schools who used minecraft to learn things with red stonethis would be a great add on 
XcrFwgDUV9E,i helped one of my teachers learn how to play this edition d
XcrFwgDUV9E,i wonder when they will fix the animation error on player entities in pocket edition and its variants
XcrFwgDUV9E,i want that version how fun could it get hyped on video
XcrFwgDUV9E,wish my school had this but i have it separately in the future bedrock edition feature education edition
XcrFwgDUV9E,ahh the camera brings memories back from the early ages of mcpe
XcrFwgDUV9E,wow never knew this was actually meant for school this is perfect for online classes
XcrFwgDUV9E,i have this at school and play every friday
XcrFwgDUV9E,his videos are amazing and he deserve 50 times as much as subscribers than he has already
XcrFwgDUV9E,that stuff should also be part of the custom npcs mod for all us folk that may not be able to get our schools to approve of such a thing
XcrFwgDUV9E,put sodium above tnt to get underwater tnt
XcrFwgDUV9E,we use this in our school its really fun and almost like pocket edition
XcrFwgDUV9E,fun fact most of the items made it into bedrock edition
XcrFwgDUV9E,awhile ago the camera was in mobile version about two years ago the only way to get it was through commands so its very neat
XcrFwgDUV9E,i played thisthe special versionits awesome
XcrFwgDUV9E,if my sister manages to become a teacher im going to force her to use this
XcrFwgDUV9E,i legitimately remember playing that in my elementary school it was awesome

eiFmB3psH0I,the big question is porsche cayenne bmw x5 or this new range rover sport let us know
eiFmB3psH0I,that red color pops just insanely well in combination with black surfaces they should put it into production  its a nobrainer really 
eiFmB3psH0I,puro luxo  sofisticao
eiFmB3psH0I,cant afford this but love to watch how much effort range rover put in it
eiFmB3psH0I,this looks pretty cool its smooth and clean like the full size range rover  and also
eiFmB3psH0I,absolutely love it colour too  i was worried theyd ruin it but its perfect
eiFmB3psH0I,wow i love that colour  what a gorgeous  design
eiFmB3psH0I,love the new sport love the red color
eiFmB3psH0I,theyve knocked it out of the park again makes all other suvs and luxury cars for that matter look last generation bmws design team need to pay attention in particular
eiFmB3psH0I,recently bought a range rover sport 2018 and really thought they couldnt beat that model but this is quickly growing on me fantastic car inside and out
eiFmB3psH0I,this is the most beautiful range rover ever im really excited about the hybrid version of this amazingly capable vehicle
eiFmB3psH0I,beautiful piece of engineering
eiFmB3psH0I,the colour is gorgeous and i would buy this exact looking one in a heartbeat
eiFmB3psH0I,i love it the red makes it that much better 100 percent a win in my book
eiFmB3psH0I,absolutely beautiful this car has me giving a second look at ice rather than ev
eiFmB3psH0I,ive got to say this is the first range rover i actually like great job with the design
eiFmB3psH0I,range rover will always be my favourite  this could be my next one
eiFmB3psH0I,just beautiful work of art
eiFmB3psH0I,wow absolutely stunning new model love  the colour
eiFmB3psH0I,i love the color especially the twotone beautiful
eiFmB3psH0I,land rover coming up with some great designs easily the best in the world
eiFmB3psH0I,the mother of the all cars and its colour amazing  
eiFmB3psH0I,simply stunning
eiFmB3psH0I,love the car love the red a must have colour
eiFmB3psH0I,this car will be absolutely everywhere on uk roads soon
eiFmB3psH0I,itll sell like hot cakes and rightly sovery muscular presence great design and no huge snout
eiFmB3psH0I,this is the first red colour i love on a range rover looks amazing
eiFmB3psH0I,great colour
eiFmB3psH0I,what a beast of a car 
eiFmB3psH0I,this red range rover is the best colour they have ever produced they should definitely sell it with this colour it would be silly if they didnt
eiFmB3psH0I,i love that red colour ill certainly order that red with black contrast roof if its available
eiFmB3psH0I,i got 2011 range sportits time to upgradethis is insane
eiFmB3psH0I,by far the best looking range rover with clean modern lines the big question has reliability improved for this latest model
eiFmB3psH0I,nice looking suv but whats the reliability going to be 
eiFmB3psH0I,the color is incredible
eiFmB3psH0I,i dont think its bad but it looks super close to the velar now in my opinion
eiFmB3psH0I,beautiful design i have a 2018 velarlooks like they borrowed some designing for this car i guess it is time for an upgrade
eiFmB3psH0I,looks so good itll be in service for most of its life
eiFmB3psH0I,this is a thing of beauty
eiFmB3psH0I,im sure this will have the highest quality reliability and dependability
eiFmB3psH0I,yes love the colour of this 2022 range rover sport range rover  you need to make this very popular colour available
eiFmB3psH0I,quite surprised how scratched the rear light lenses were for a launch model think they could have done a bit better with the finish on them
eiFmB3psH0I,the rear suffers the same problem as the recent bmw x6 that big gap sticks out way too much and feels that something could be there
eiFmB3psH0I,beautiful design and a beautiful colour
eiFmB3psH0I,exterior colour looks refreshing
eiFmB3psH0I,yes to the red  no to the coupe roofline unless its 3 door like the stormer concept
eiFmB3psH0I,lovely suv but probably save myself a fortune and buy a jaguar fpace instead has similar interior and equally great exterior
eiFmB3psH0I,im supposed to be the target demographic 35 but im leaning towards the larger range rover over the sport both are nice tho
eiFmB3psH0I,the big range has a more cutting edge design i really dont like the three layer grill up frontinterior is really gorgeous
eiFmB3psH0I,it looks great when is a fully electric version coming
eiFmB3psH0I,nice looking suv really beautiful but one question remains open to when an eletric range rover sport
eiFmB3psH0I,as usual with jlr 1010 for design it remains to be seen if they can improve on their woeful 510 for reliability
eiFmB3psH0I,stunning colour
eiFmB3psH0I,absolutely thumbs up this is a super sexy vehicle and the red color keep the red
eiFmB3psH0I,the big negative gbp79k starting price wow pricey does look great though
eiFmB3psH0I,should of left the plate where it was rear end looks awkward now
eiFmB3psH0I,superb colour  another beautiful design but not keen on rear lights   just hope theyve redesigned the quality control  reliability 
eiFmB3psH0I,looks like an evoque at 15x scale   i was on the configurator today and it looks really good in darker colors
eiFmB3psH0I,i wonder how good the v8 version will sound seeing as theyre all bmw powertrains now
eiFmB3psH0I,love the colour
eiFmB3psH0I,am i hearing right a phev that does 80 miles on the battery if so thats a real game changer
eiFmB3psH0I,jeremy if you are reading this just know you dissapointed alot of sport fans with this design this looks exactly like the previous velar the design team was extremely lazy
eiFmB3psH0I,anybody else thinks the previous gen looked better  especially from the back
eiFmB3psH0I,not really interested in the person designing the car telling me how much he loves his own design
eiFmB3psH0I,i like the jaguar fpace more that the new range rover sport
eiFmB3psH0I,love the color
eiFmB3psH0I,if they could add toyotalexus levels of reliability they would sell so many more units
eiFmB3psH0I,i used to love range rover back in the days but if you do live in london i do not think you will have any sympathy for that car
eiFmB3psH0I,great video love the color
eiFmB3psH0I,looks good but the range rover looks better especially from the rear
eiFmB3psH0I,i can already see something breaking within a few weeks kewping the land rover tradition alive
eiFmB3psH0I,cant wait for a new rr velar
eiFmB3psH0I,awesome colour love it
eiFmB3psH0I,its beautiful
eiFmB3psH0I,love the color
eiFmB3psH0I,beautiful design but im putting lr on notice now  we want leather
eiFmB3psH0I,im falling in love with rr since 90s
40UGS6kd9Wg,it takes a simple google search to see if the name is already taken
40UGS6kd9Wg,hailey can i have the name
40UGS6kd9Wg,he didnt write that please trying to buy the name 4 years ago knowing and then going ahead anyway says something about her character sad
40UGS6kd9Wg,how about protecting the original brand are they not worth saving too
40UGS6kd9Wg,whats so hard about celebrities googling their wanted brand names
40UGS6kd9Wg,just bc ur famous bc ur married to a celebrity doesnt mean she can break the law and take a business that has been built by someone else
40UGS6kd9Wg,they existed first if i was hailey id just change the name tbh
40UGS6kd9Wg,boring hailey show some respect and build other women to like you said we all should
40UGS6kd9Wg,as long as they copyright it before she took it then the court will fall in their favor
40UGS6kd9Wg,i dont get what jb sees in that woman only copy paste always want a copy someone  they both have no confidence  boooooring
40UGS6kd9Wg,dont care for this host
40UGS6kd9Wg,double damn
40UGS6kd9Wg,ive never heard of the other rhode before like ever so maybe hailey hasnt heard about them either
40UGS6kd9Wg,calling hailey hailey baldwin bieber is triggering for her and you know it lmao

UBZ6Bd0LDjs,were going exactly in the direction we shouldnt go kudos to the effort
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,the people forging this sham are genius the people buying into it make me embarrassed for our entire species
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,i cant stress this enough pricing does not always reflect demand
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,goldmine or not accepting this concept as the future of clothing is not only deceptive but its also psychologically destructive ill pass
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,why do we need a metaverse why are we doing this it literally makes no sense why were pushing this so hard
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,i bought a large plot of land in the metaverse and i hope my kids can build and start families on it
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,this is going to be mainstream in a couple of years you can already tell the direction our society is headed
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,people are dying out of hunger but some are spending money on things that dont exist we have truly reached the point of no return
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,when everybody is in the metaverse finally i can go for a walk in the real world and meet nobody  sounds relaxing
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,i dont know yall i really loved imvu  the sims as a kid
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,can you imagine buying sneakers online only to find out you bought a digital copy of sneakers
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,wearing a jersey in the metaverse and feeling cold in reality
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,welldone  people gonna buy literally just air and spend a fortune for that
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,its about having a more immersive digital experience which in the end is what the metaverse is about
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,your videos are always awesome and this one is no exception thanks for the coherent explanation going to send it to some irl friends
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,imagine buying digital clothes for your fake universe while people starve and freeze to death in the streets
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,very well done video easy to consume cannot wait to see what the dematerialised and rtfkt studios brings to the game
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,its crazy how humans we are slowly distancing ourselves to reallife
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,this metaverse fashion film explains a lot  well done 
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,we will own nothing and we will be happy  owning digital stuff
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,this is the best explanation of the metaverse and nfts so far
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,i have a feeling this wont look any less dumb 10 years from now
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,love the way you conduce the interviews great job
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,i can not think of a single reason that i might want to spend even a cent on clothes i cant wear
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,i want to be a minimalist in virtual space tooso id get few simple and cheap clothing and stuff that will spark joy to my life 
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,well done video thank you very much for pulling this together
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,a very insightful video to understand this new trend thanks for that
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,ready player one seems to becoming real with every passing day
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,i like how they didnt interview people who made mods for decades or sims modders they found other yuppies
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,the metaverse  when you have more money than brains
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,people will have to be into the metaverse first before fashion can mine its gold
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,this is so so amazing a totally new world for so many the question is how this can bridge the evergrowing gap between the north and south
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,hi imran thank you so much for creating this youtube this is exactly what i am working on
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,suddenly metaverse became hot topic overnight
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,im not about to be broke in the real world and metaverse ill pass lol
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,cant afford rent dont worry you can buy some virtual luxury clothes
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,excellent video always bringing new ideas and horizons
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,as someone who builds worlds in vr chat ill become a metaverse mogul its pretty easy to learn how to program clothes and environments
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,you will own nothing and you will be happy
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,its as viable as a pyramid scheme without the pyramid
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,great explanations thanks for sharing
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,i am both scared and excited about this great interview
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,building ourselves into the matrix slowly grateful growing up with the forest as my playground
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,metacrap now they are going to charge for things that arent real welcome to metaloss
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,so well actually own nothing in the true physical sense and be happy
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,metaverse is giving me second life vibes
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,and neo thought that the machines were somehow forcing people to stay hooked up
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,were really going to be living in the matrix  commercial  arent you tired of the real world join the meta verse
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,great video needs to be seen by everyone in or not yet in the nft space
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,i love this series
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,extremely well done thank you
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,its indecent to produce a collection without bringing couture to life in the meta
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,dude we can literally 3d print our way into virtual to real fashion 
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,im so surprised to see platforms like imvu and animal crossing but not second life where people have been successfully doing this since before 2006 there
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,it would be great if there was a reference to the different games you showed throughout this video
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,the metaverse is like a huge open world game
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,we are consumers were the byproducts of a lifestyle obsession
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,it is mind boggling that michio kaku talked about this years ago and now it is happening for real
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,changing our definition of what is real
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,great context and perspective on what is unfolding now with web3 on the blockchain
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,wow this is fascinating  few years ago i also found your video exploring the fashion industry
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,people that have never worn a real couture article of clothing will be 100 satisfied with an nft substitute
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,thanks for this very inspirational
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,we will loss the life element of touching and feeling metaverse is just like afterlife land
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,i really think in 5 years people will be embarrassed they hyped it just because there are money in it now
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,i think metaverse will become a thing i got hooked by metaversus thats why as early as now i want to learn in depth about the metaverse
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,as technology evolved things will get uglier
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,amazing video thank you
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,this freaks me out and we know zuckerberg nor gates will allow their kids to use this
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,this is interesting and all but when will we ever properly get taught how to sew
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,this will make more sense when augmented reality glasses and eye contacts arrive then everyone doubting will eat their words
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,metaverse is the death of the human youre willing to b enslaved by artificial intelligence well done
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,how is this going forward you want to live in a computer and call it a leap forward mind blown
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,the core concept of the metaverse is about connecting deeply with someone through digital means allowing for a more indepth experience in the process
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,i used to think what makes an expensive garment is production techniques and materials used
FJFiROx20OM,the fact that biden didnt see oil executives is unforgivable  rude  embarrassing
FJFiROx20OM,he skipped the meeting with oil executives  during an energy crisis that is unforgivable
FJFiROx20OM,protect peter doocy at all cost one of the best and last journalist actually doing their job
FJFiROx20OM,thank you peter for asking the questions no other journalists do
FJFiROx20OM,peter doocy is a good interviewer and reporter
FJFiROx20OM,him doing that and skipping out to go to a meeting about wind power is just a big middle finger to the united states
FJFiROx20OM,he skipped the meeting so he can keep blaming the oil companies brilliant
FJFiROx20OM,well we must face it grampa joes handlers can not let him into a room with any intelligent people for a serious conversation the truth would come out
FJFiROx20OM,i like how she tries to silence peter doocy but he refuses to be silenced
FJFiROx20OM,i wish all reporters were like peter need to demand answers
FJFiROx20OM,this is really pissing the people off and something has to be done quickly
FJFiROx20OM,he didnt go because he knew they would call him out on his bs why cant any media say it like it truly is
FJFiROx20OM,doocey finally showing his talons    love how hes pushing back and not letting her spew her canned lies
FJFiROx20OM,if you dont screw up a country in 12 months you aint biden
FJFiROx20OM,we need more reporters like peter doocy thats not afraid to ask real freaking questions please peter doocy keep up the great work
FJFiROx20OM,brandon cares not for domestic oil companies  he would rather beg for oil from foreign companies
FJFiROx20OM,hes done everything in his power to drive fuel prices up every decision he makes benefits him and the elites but not american people
FJFiROx20OM,how he could skip this meeting is beyond me  what a putz  get rid of him
FJFiROx20OM,how very sad for this country when are people going to understand what this administration is doing its destroying us
FJFiROx20OM,im so glad doocy didnt let her step back
FJFiROx20OM,he can skip meeting with the oil execs but if he wanted them at a meeting and they didnt show hed have them arrested
FJFiROx20OM,wind power literately most inefficient energy source possible this administrations a joke
FJFiROx20OM,his answer to fix the economy is to build a windmill give me a break he has not done any good in fourty plus years we knew this was coming
FJFiROx20OM,this entire administration needs to be removed  prosecuted to the fullest extent
FJFiROx20OM,good job peter  she cant answer one question  she is so incompetent of her job
FJFiROx20OM,doocy getting even more aggressive loving it rip them a new one peter
FJFiROx20OM,wind turbines never produce enough energy to pay for themselves period joe needs to be talking to oil executives
FJFiROx20OM,it couldnt be more obvious that dems are trying to tank this thing intentionally you dont screw up this hard and this consistently if its not intentionally
FJFiROx20OM,remember when he told us he was going to shut down the oil industry during the primaries told it straight to our faces
FJFiROx20OM,pete knows how to ask questions that are unanswerable by any spokesperson least of all by the most inarticulate wh mouthpiece in history
FJFiROx20OM,sounds like old dementia joe doesnt want to hear the truth from the energy producers lets go brando fjb
FJFiROx20OM,looks like we keep heading to an economic disaster on top of the disaster known as brandon
FJFiROx20OM,he didnt show up just like his entire presidency god bless our country 
FJFiROx20OM,this administration is a joke just like hiring someone based on their skin color and or sexual orientation
FJFiROx20OM,now theyre skipping meetings so that they dont have to be confronted with any issues and they can continue going on their plans the way they want them to be
FJFiROx20OM,we have a clown in the white house  harris is the court jester
FJFiROx20OM,thankyou maria for all you do to inform americans using facts to expose the truth
FJFiROx20OM,the latitude of thought must eventually meld with the finite truth this administration will be held accountable for this charade 
FJFiROx20OM,not in montana thank the lord i hope kristi noem is taking note and standing strong against this maybe the private sector could do a better job
FJFiROx20OM,just when we thought joe couldnt be any dumber and he goes and does something like this
FJFiROx20OM,biden and the dems 100 wind powered
FJFiROx20OM,right on pete
FJFiROx20OM,potato head said in his campaign that he would shut down fossil fuels so the high oil prices is exactly what he wants
FJFiROx20OM,doing all you can means meet with the oil executives  every action brandon has taken is costing the people more and more
FJFiROx20OM,weve had it with biden get him out
FJFiROx20OM,they have converted border agents to travel agents wow
FJFiROx20OM,you go peter keep getting in their face thank you
FJFiROx20OM,peter is a beast calls out them all i love him and his dad
FJFiROx20OM,i cant even imagine that biden can have a legible conversation with any powerful executive
FJFiROx20OM,he skipped the sit down because his queue card for telling him what to do was lost
FJFiROx20OM,just one more example of how he really feels about this energy crisis he does not want to solve it therefore avoid the people who can offer solutions
FJFiROx20OM,buffoons in charge thanks a lot
FJFiROx20OM,peter doocy speaks for all of us
FJFiROx20OM,awesome standing up to the let me step back lol
FJFiROx20OM,thank god for doocy  he is the only one in the room that will stand up and ask the questions that need to be ask
FJFiROx20OM,this is all by design  buyden flat out said the same thing obama said  were going to crush the fossil fuel industry
FJFiROx20OM,the guy beside doocy is like  i wish   my network lets me asked those questions
FJFiROx20OM,i would have loved to be a fly on the walk during that meeting he actually went to
FJFiROx20OM,the only boost to the economic growth that will happen will be to his wallet with his back door deals with this green companies
FJFiROx20OM,know what im glad peter is there asking the uncomfortable questions they dont want to address not every reporter is buying their bs
FJFiROx20OM,i have more business being in the same cage as randy couture than this woman does being in the same press conference as doocy
FJFiROx20OM,with brandon his hot air could power a small city
FJFiROx20OM,brandons staff this instills confidence lol
FJFiROx20OM,peter the relentless
FJFiROx20OM,well bidens defense the wind people had ice cream the oil people didnt
FJFiROx20OM,this woman is truly in a league of her own i dont say that lightly
FJFiROx20OM,love peter grilling the clueless press secretary
FJFiROx20OM,if a bunch of wind would help why dont we all just watch the view
FJFiROx20OM,geez its crazy i have no words left
FJFiROx20OM,this whole administration has violated their oath to this country
FJFiROx20OM,thank you peter for doing the job as a journalist and giving me a laugh
FJFiROx20OM,love it when peter ducey pushes the question
FJFiROx20OM,doocy is exposing these clowns with simple questions but real questions he deserves an award
FJFiROx20OM,the political wind is the most integral part of the dem plan
FJFiROx20OM,we are all struggling somebody needs to do something now
FJFiROx20OM,bidens crowd shows up in the 10s
FJFiROx20OM,ah karine is evolving  shehetheyitwhatever is now taking a step back before stammering evading and lying  looks like karine has found the equivalent of psakis vacuous circle back
FJFiROx20OM,i just love the look on jean luc picards face everytime its peter doocys turn to ask questions
FJFiROx20OM,lets get serious for a moment we got to get a grip on the price of wind
FJFiROx20OM,brandon has done everything in his power translation brandon has done absolutely nothingin factthe opposite is true this devastation is deliberate
FJFiROx20OM,get em doocy  all their bs going as planned
FJFiROx20OM,fair play hes the only true reporter that is in attendance ever
FJFiROx20OM,we love you peter doocy you have the courage to confront  a backhoe these press conferences are a disgrace to the integrity of the wh  every american
FJFiROx20OM,wind is great when it is windy  oil is great regardless of wind
FJFiROx20OM,hearing her say let me step back for a second makes me instantly think of
FJFiROx20OM,the ccp owns most if not all the wind generators germany is second
FJFiROx20OM,i wonder if her first thought every day upon waking is i really hope doocy is out sick today

6-Oj83hX0Zg,i think whats impressive is the fact jamie made enough food for a family of four plus for the same amount of money that fed 2 with mike and baz
6-Oj83hX0Zg,mike i need to use the grater more
6-Oj83hX0Zg,i cant imagine wasting food would ever be a problem with jamie
6-Oj83hX0Zg,based on the criteria barry wins but im more happy with jamies performance because id actually be full after eating his dishes
6-Oj83hX0Zg,i really like this series of battles between the normals any plans for a new series since this one is wrapping up today
6-Oj83hX0Zg,now id really love to see a video where ben explains what berry and jamie would have had to improve to get the missing 22 and 29 respectively
6-Oj83hX0Zg,i feel like the badges should have been awarded after reaching 70 barry was a clear winner but jamie deserves the badges too
6-Oj83hX0Zg,good job jamie you are the englishitalian mamma of this constellation so much food would have loved more shopping footage
6-Oj83hX0Zg,spaff portions are the standard samoan portion if theres any left for a second portion then id wonder if jamie is secretly polynesian
6-Oj83hX0Zg,my stovetop is broken at the moment and i have to come up with recipes that are ovenbased that first chicken recipe is perfect thank you for the idea
6-Oj83hX0Zg,in all honesty i think jamie deserved both badges as well just as much
6-Oj83hX0Zg,these battles are so informative and entertaining would love to see different takes on the same format for sure
6-Oj83hX0Zg,barry really outdid himself and im so happy to hear that he was so scared of losing badges lol
6-Oj83hX0Zg,as someone with long nails and sensitive finger pads its always hilarious to me to watch someone struggle with cling film
6-Oj83hX0Zg,jamies looked to be heavy on portions and flavor and  im here for it
6-Oj83hX0Zg,it would be nice to see more episodes in this format perhaps all vegeterian meals
6-Oj83hX0Zg,would love to see this series using supermarket own brand items to teach us how to make great meals on strong budgets
6-Oj83hX0Zg,could be cool to see another version of this series with one 45 minute recipe a 30 min and a 15 min
6-Oj83hX0Zg,loved this series would love to see a part 2 with the same budget  now food prices have risen so much would be interesting to see the difference
6-Oj83hX0Zg,i feel like jamie did the recent lentil and kale shakshouka recipe because that for two was easily six portions
6-Oj83hX0Zg,barry just had one of those days where everything goes so perfect you never want it to end because you know it will be made up for in the future
6-Oj83hX0Zg,this was so fun id love to see it done with different dietary restrictions because those tend to increase prices or make things more repetitive
6-Oj83hX0Zg,this really feels like jamies comedy special because i had a great laugh the rubbing of the garlic and the clingfilm controversy was just top tier
6-Oj83hX0Zg,congratulations barry what a comeback after the badge disaster earlier this year you were really inspiring
6-Oj83hX0Zg,i thoroughly enjoyed this series and found myself actually waiting for the release of each episode well done team
6-Oj83hX0Zg,this is such a strong concept for a series i would watch an exact copy of this series again so good
6-Oj83hX0Zg,how many italians can i offend
6-Oj83hX0Zg,i certainly hope that some of these will turn into sidekicks i would definitely do jamies dishes well done guys
6-Oj83hX0Zg,absolutely loved this mini series was a blast to watch great job barry
6-Oj83hX0Zg,this was a really good mini series i absolutely loved it
6-Oj83hX0Zg,ben  we need two portions of food per meal
6-Oj83hX0Zg,so nice seeing normal ingredients though im vegan i like talent and these guys have it without excessive ego on display
6-Oj83hX0Zg,i disagree with mike spaffs portion of mashed potatoes is actually a normal amount for me lol
6-Oj83hX0Zg,watching jamie struggles with the cling film reminds me of something japanesekorean saran wraps are superb and have amazing builtin cutter that makes it really easy next gadget review
6-Oj83hX0Zg,out of all of these on this little series jamies recipes are the ones i want to eat
6-Oj83hX0Zg,tbh jamie is my kind of guy good eating with a lot of it
6-Oj83hX0Zg,i love that when jamie drops the fork of food you can hear ed cracking up
6-Oj83hX0Zg,this was definitely one of the funniest and best series you guys have come up with love it
6-Oj83hX0Zg,jamie needs a clean film badge for this achievement
6-Oj83hX0Zg,loved this series because the normals acted like normals the meals were ones that i personally would love to try would def watch more of these
6-Oj83hX0Zg,loved this series best thing youve done in a while it really showed off each of the normals personalities
6-Oj83hX0Zg,i think jamies done a excellent job there would be enough for the kids too i dont see anything that my kids would say no to
6-Oj83hX0Zg,absolutely loved this series so creative and so fun i agree  for once barry absolutely smashed it
6-Oj83hX0Zg,would love to see jamies meals in sidekick
6-Oj83hX0Zg,jamie absolutely won in my eyes if the whole point was getting the most value from the ingredients its not even a question
6-Oj83hX0Zg,jamies cooking is my style  simple ingredients good flavor generous aka economical portions i appreciate that he put veg in each dish too
6-Oj83hX0Zg,jamies dinners seemed most like something id like to eat out of the whole lot but  flavour and preferences are very subjective fair judging overall
6-Oj83hX0Zg,you guys are the best great series great show thank you for sharing and for your inspiration
6-Oj83hX0Zg,absolutely loved this miniseries please please do this again d
6-Oj83hX0Zg,berry definitely earned that win but i think i would rather have eaten jamies dishes
6-Oj83hX0Zg,you guys have been adding sorted staff reactions what is great
6-Oj83hX0Zg,great series more like this please
6-Oj83hX0Zg,ive seen barry and mike robbed in favor of jamie a few times so was relieved to see it go fairly here congrats baz
6-Oj83hX0Zg,i vote for jaimes dishes  lots of leftovers for the week and it looks as if they could easily be frozen
6-Oj83hX0Zg,this whole thing was amazing look at how far the normals have come
6-Oj83hX0Zg,i feel his portions of cooking are ideal because any extra just means you have lunch for the next day 2 birds 1 stone
6-Oj83hX0Zg,nice to see barry moving up the food and skills ladder rock on
6-Oj83hX0Zg,well done barry  well done
6-Oj83hX0Zg,i havent laughed this much from the pure banter in a long time
6-Oj83hX0Zg,love this series i really hope that you do it again
6-Oj83hX0Zg,im impressed with jamie id have every single one of those any day of the week
6-Oj83hX0Zg,fantastic series with food prices increasing it gives us some options with a lot of fun and laughter mixed in

Ay4qA5emBFw,watch all new episodes of pawn stars returning soon and stay up to date on all of your favorite the history channel shows at
Ay4qA5emBFw,they should have paid a lot more for the apple computer especially since it came with all the manuals and programs
Ay4qA5emBFw,i remember the commodore 64  i used it in high school in 1983  thought it was so cool  amazing how tech has advanced so fast since then
Ay4qA5emBFw,i love listening to ric go into the history of items but in most cases the person bringing it in could care less its all about the money
Ay4qA5emBFw,so good to see the old man in these compilations such a great guy sad he passed
Ay4qA5emBFw,id love to bring my entire hockey card collection to these guys id be so interested in seeing what they all cost
Ay4qA5emBFw,got all the golden oldies that calculator was pretty cool was fun to watch great video
Ay4qA5emBFw,i can remember walking every day with my walkman  a truly great invention
Ay4qA5emBFw,never carry something heavy into the shop they will talk you down knowing you dont want to carry it back out
Ay4qA5emBFw,that calculator was really neat id love one of those
Ay4qA5emBFw,yea fair to say the shop got a good deal on the apple iigs  that machine was complete
Ay4qA5emBFw,funny having grown up in the 80s how futuristic everything looked at the time
Ay4qA5emBFw,the history of technology will always be fascinating its one of the most definite way to catalogue humanitys progress
Ay4qA5emBFw,i didnt know that over century old calculator existed but the sony walkman and the commodore 64 are iconic
Ay4qA5emBFw,wow this is awesome people love collecting these 50 bucks and not a penny more
Ay4qA5emBFw,the walkman guy was two steps ahead the whole time and rick fell right into his trap
Ay4qA5emBFw,i would like to see a compilation of chum breaking stuff
Ay4qA5emBFw,thats the first playlist ive watched where they bought everything pretty cool
Ay4qA5emBFw,that was kind of dishonest paying so low for that apple pc
Ay4qA5emBFw,these episodes take me back to my youth   so nostalgic 
Ay4qA5emBFw,so much cool stuff on this show
Ay4qA5emBFw,wow this is my childhood all wrapped up in one video
Ay4qA5emBFw,they should have paid a lot more for the apple computer especially since it came with all the manuals and programs
Ay4qA5emBFw,you robbed her that apple computer was worth far more than  10000  moreover why would she sell it
Ay4qA5emBFw,i wouldnt have minded having that viewmaster if it had everything with it
Ay4qA5emBFw,cool stuff man the walkman was a trip down 80s lane  crazy to no im 50 already
Ay4qA5emBFw,that first one with the apple computer was brutal lol
Ay4qA5emBFw,the guy with the walkman did the deal perfectly
Ay4qA5emBFw,some of the personal moments between them may seem a little setup but their misery is genuine and i love it
Ay4qA5emBFw,to be honest with the watch you could hook up a raspberry pi or smth to output an analog signal that it could pick up letting you still stream stuff
Ay4qA5emBFw,i remember having the knockoff walkmans when i inherited my grandparents money i went to best buy and bought an actual walkman it sounded soooooo much better
Ay4qA5emBFw,my favorite thing is that as the years go on corey becomes the most responsible one in the shop and rick and chum become best friends lmao
Ay4qA5emBFw,i like how back in the day having headphones on was considered rude but nowadays the opposite is rude listening to music on a speaker
Ay4qA5emBFw,my high school had two commodore 64s in the computer lab thats what we learned how to code back in the mid 1980s
Ay4qA5emBFw,not the first time rick looked down at a 3 12 floppy
Ay4qA5emBFw,do you know how many people would pay 1000 dollars for that apple 2
Ay4qA5emBFw,aww man i just threw this out along with my yellow sony walkman cassette player that was the best  mixed tapes never skipping lol secured locked in that sucker
Ay4qA5emBFw,they could flip this without even trying it hurt my soul to see her take 100 for it
Ay4qA5emBFw,the apple seller made a huge mistake some sony dork wouldve paid 3 grand for that
Ay4qA5emBFw,i have the watch the commodore and the walkman packed away in my basement time to dig it all out and put them on ebay
Ay4qA5emBFw,amazing show
Ay4qA5emBFw,the guys and dolls walkman was so cool also a great clip ending
Ay4qA5emBFw,rare tech items rick there were so many of these it just isnt that rare lmfao
Ay4qA5emBFw,she went waaaay too low for the apple machine fully restored with that many disks and the manual easily could fetch 400 online
Ay4qA5emBFw,i would have given many times over 100 for that apple computer  it was in perfect condition
Ay4qA5emBFw,the only deal i was happy with here was the commodore 64 because thats actually overpriced for what it came with
Ay4qA5emBFw,jose waited his whole life for that one second of screen time
Ay4qA5emBFw,that lady with the apple gear totally taken advantage of
Ay4qA5emBFw,the c64 may be worth about 400 max with the printer in my opinion
Ay4qA5emBFw,pawn stars is such a good tv  show
Ay4qA5emBFw,gotta love chumleehe wants to take every cool gadget home
Ay4qA5emBFw,rick what do you have for us today
Ay4qA5emBFw,that apple computer is almost 2 grand i feel so bad for that girl
Ay4qA5emBFw,its sweet corey vying for his dads respect and position chumlee being the child who just wants to hang out with rickimpress him instead of replace him
Ay4qA5emBFw,i want that seiko tv watch it looked cool
Ay4qA5emBFw,i would have paid her the 150 for the apple computer and the commodore 64 i want one
Ay4qA5emBFw,in this specific episode i felt that rick has scammed most customers and have underestimated  their items value
Ay4qA5emBFw,i identify with chumlee so much in the apple ii segment xd
Ay4qA5emBFw,jose is a guy that i havent seen before how long has he been in that pawnshop
Ay4qA5emBFw,the apple 2gs was 12 years ago its just painful how most of you cant comprehend how different the market was back then
Ay4qA5emBFw,i want a dollar fitty for this excalibur sword made out of silver and gold old man there is no way
Ay4qA5emBFw,just because im a wonderful human being ill go 130 i thought he was gonna say 135
Ay4qA5emBFw,i still remember when they tried moving from floppy disk to zip drives
Ay4qA5emBFw,these guys are the ultimate american family
Ay4qA5emBFw,not retroretro is something new in the style of something oldthis is vintagesomething that is actually old
Ay4qA5emBFw,this compilation should be renamed largest lowball offers in pawn stars history
Ay4qA5emBFw,those walkman players were good but they had a habit of chewing up the cassette tape i had one in 1980s apple destroyed the walkman market with the ipod
Ay4qA5emBFw,anyone else who is getting extremely nostalgic watching this
Ay4qA5emBFw,this will be the most viewed video of the year for pawn stars just waiting to see how many people love old school versus new crap
Ay4qA5emBFw,rick how do you play this thing chum
Ay4qA5emBFw,that apple computer is worth way more than 100 bucks
Ay4qA5emBFw,yall kinda screwed over the lady with the apple 2gs
Ay4qA5emBFw,got all the golden oldies
Ay4qA5emBFw,interesting how none of these they call a buddy starting to think the experts keep them honest otherwise they con people all day
Ay4qA5emBFw,every night i watch them for the simple reason chumli a real real one rick still laughing 
Ay4qA5emBFw,sometimes watching this show seems like watching a robbery
Ay4qA5emBFw,i dont know why everyone looks at rick so crazy when hes being funny i think he is so funny smart man with moneythat is for sure
Ay4qA5emBFw,dont sell your stuff at a pawn shop
Ay4qA5emBFw,that walkman was so cool
Ay4qA5emBFw,here i am on my 6th generation ipad thinking its an ancient relic

tSJf6KEC5qc,offended by everything ashamed of nothing
tSJf6KEC5qc,how people can justify something like this by using religious beliefs is beyond me what possible reason would an individual have had to take the life of this man
tSJf6KEC5qc,bbc has no negative remarks about the brutal beheadingquite telling in the way that they shield islamic terrorism from criticism
tSJf6KEC5qc,from terrorism has no religion to all terrorist have same religion we all grew up
tSJf6KEC5qc,i dont care who you are insulting someones religion or religious leaders never justifies murder  if you want respect for your religion stop acting like barbaric savages
tSJf6KEC5qc,peaceful people from peaceful religion spreading peace
tSJf6KEC5qc,lovely tolerant people able to accept other view points lets import more of these friendly people diversity is our strength
tSJf6KEC5qc,shame on bbc doesnt talk about the killing but suddenly react on the protest for the demand of justice
tSJf6KEC5qc,im buddhist  you can insult my prophet as much as you want  i do not mind he taught me about forgiveness
tSJf6KEC5qc,yet another nice example of how peaceful this religion is
tSJf6KEC5qc,god bless india so many tolerant and gentle people terrorised by a few
tSJf6KEC5qc,as an ex muslim love it when muslims lecture me on their religion of peace
tSJf6KEC5qc,almost all muslims condemned the action against prophet mohammed related doings in india but it is unfair not to condemn the beheading of a hindu man
tSJf6KEC5qc,wonderful how religion brings people together in a spirit of love and brotherhood just unites us all
tSJf6KEC5qc,when you insult any other religion then islam then you are librel free thinker and progressive
tSJf6KEC5qc,here we go this is the real face of peaceful religion
tSJf6KEC5qc,may god protect the world from those demons trying to take over
tSJf6KEC5qc,killing someone is never an act for god it is an act against him
tSJf6KEC5qc,nothing like this has happened before in northern india
tSJf6KEC5qc,last words of the victim   please dont kill me i have two children
tSJf6KEC5qc,such a loving religion of peace
tSJf6KEC5qc,proof that diversity isnt a strength but social cohesion is celebrate everything we have in common and promote tolerance
tSJf6KEC5qc,the religion of peace is showing everyone how peaceful it is
tSJf6KEC5qc,religion poisons everything
tSJf6KEC5qc,all islamic countries condemned remarks on prophet mohammed but no one is condemned beheading a man
tSJf6KEC5qc,peaceful community spreading peace all over the world
tSJf6KEC5qc,such a disconnect those that claim to be most religious are most murderous killing in the name of a story invented by another man good grief
tSJf6KEC5qc,this is what happened when people are brainwashed by the devils book
tSJf6KEC5qc,i am a christian jesus taught me to love and to forgive my neighbourslet us pray for our countrys peace
tSJf6KEC5qc,the religion of peace and tolerance
tSJf6KEC5qc,greetings from ireland i am sick of violence in the name of god
tSJf6KEC5qc,i didnt realize god needs hitmen  you would think an all powerful being could just snap his finger and its done
tSJf6KEC5qc,considering that they want acceptance they arent exactly doing themselves any favours
tSJf6KEC5qc,norway norwegians vs peace community
tSJf6KEC5qc,doesnt a certain peaceful religion condemn other religions taught against the laws of the countries they dwell in lets be honest
tSJf6KEC5qc,peaceful community is problem everywhere in the world be india usa europe myanmar or even china one day this community will really have to pay the price
tSJf6KEC5qc,and when hindus react as we know they will guess wholl be the first to scream islamophobia
tSJf6KEC5qc,i do not understand how anyone thinks doing something like this is excusable
tSJf6KEC5qc,for those who are blaming bbc
tSJf6KEC5qc,many would say yet another example of muslims outworking their very special form of empathy and inclusion on anyone who doesnt agree with their fanaticism cut off their head
tSJf6KEC5qc,is it still called phobia if the fear is justified
tSJf6KEC5qc,this is taking freedom of speech to a much much lower level

3ZtV0HsYzmg,i am completely unable to comprehend how anyone can blame ukraine for being invaded
3ZtV0HsYzmg,i would love to hear russias explanation on how their special military operation differs from war
3ZtV0HsYzmg,190k troops for a special military operation wow thats a guinness world record
3ZtV0HsYzmg,officer i didnt rob that bank i was simply testing their security systems and took the money as advanced payment
3ZtV0HsYzmg,there was a time when politicians at least made an effort to appear to tell the truth
3ZtV0HsYzmg,they have their own world own reality and own truth and justice
3ZtV0HsYzmg,russia didnt invade huh  its kind of like saying i didnt punch you in the face your face kept hitting my fist
3ZtV0HsYzmg,during times of war i remember this quote
3ZtV0HsYzmg,russia is what it is and were not ashamed of showing who we are  really says it all
3ZtV0HsYzmg,i wish ukraine get justice and save
3ZtV0HsYzmg,lavrov slipped once and said the conflict was like a proxy war with the west i think he meant to say like a proxy special military operation with the west
3ZtV0HsYzmg,lavrov isnt lying hes just telling special reality nonaligned facts
3ZtV0HsYzmg,okay guess everyone was wrong then everythings all good over there thats a relief to hear was kinda worried for a min
3ZtV0HsYzmg,we are not ashamed of showing who we are
3ZtV0HsYzmg,when ukraine finally joins nato the nato countries can troll russia by saying
3ZtV0HsYzmg,war is peace freedom is slavery ignorance is strength
3ZtV0HsYzmg,imagine even taking russia seriously in the rest of our lifetimes
3ZtV0HsYzmg,not ashamed of being who we are we will remember that
3ZtV0HsYzmg,if you mr lavrow as an experienced diplomat had no different way of explaining things than turning a whole country into rubble you have done an abysmal job
3ZtV0HsYzmg,i love that this british dude is fluent in russian he speaks to him oneonone gets on his level to show his distaste love it
3ZtV0HsYzmg,russia is what it is and we are not ashamed of showing who we are one of rare moment of lavrov telling a truth
3ZtV0HsYzmg,one of the impressions that came to me from watching some of this is that the russian leadership fears intelligent people
3ZtV0HsYzmg,historical accounts are filled with political leaders who showed a complete absence of decency but its another level of emotion to witness it live
3ZtV0HsYzmg,its similar to what i tried to tell my girlfriend i didnt cheat it was a special relationship operation
3ZtV0HsYzmg,lavrov we started the special operation because we had to there was no other way of telling the west that dragging ukraine to nato was unacceptable act
3ZtV0HsYzmg,the total denial of the russian war shows how far they will go to continue covering up this mess they started
3ZtV0HsYzmg,its a great pity that a member of the security council can act in this way it really does test the relevance of the un
3ZtV0HsYzmg,remember russias also still targeting the south ukraines sea exports incl grain and making persistent incremental progress  toward connecting  occupied eastern ukraine to transnistria
3ZtV0HsYzmg,the first casualty of war is truth not sure of the origin of that quote but so true
3ZtV0HsYzmg,there is no war in ba sing se  lavrov basic summary of his response
3ZtV0HsYzmg,we are not squeaky clean and we are not ashamed to be criminally responsible for the invasion that is not a war
3ZtV0HsYzmg,russia is what it is  strong quote
3ZtV0HsYzmg,i simply cannot accept that there are on every story two equal and logical sides to an arguement
3ZtV0HsYzmg,the world what the fuck is that
3ZtV0HsYzmg,imagine losing thousands on a special operation if sas lose 10 of its men in a spec ops its considered costly and a failure
3ZtV0HsYzmg,russia bring it on
3ZtV0HsYzmg,comical sergei is definitely away with the fairies
3ZtV0HsYzmg,we have always been at war with eurasia we have never been at war with eastasia
3ZtV0HsYzmg,dragging them into nato
3ZtV0HsYzmg,wowunbelievablewhat a despicable guyi wonder when those lies going to endtoo bad that russians people going to suffer this collapse for a very long timepraying for ukraine
3ZtV0HsYzmg,russia has not invaded ukraine
3ZtV0HsYzmg,this is a special rhetoric operation it consists of telling everyone that you are not fighting a war  while you are
3ZtV0HsYzmg,we did not invade ukraine how could you invade your own territory
3ZtV0HsYzmg,thanks russia just when people are getting distracted you remind everyone just how despicable you are
3ZtV0HsYzmg,gives putin an out to save face when they pull out its not a defeat in a war just the conclusion of his special operation
3ZtV0HsYzmg,relieved i had thought cities were being destroyed and people were dying
3ZtV0HsYzmg,russia is what it is and we are not ashamed of showing who we are
3ZtV0HsYzmg,lavrov saying hes only interested in international law now ive heard it all
3ZtV0HsYzmg,actions speak louder than words russian deputy minister deny as much as you want but in the end the russian will be forever be shameful and disgraced after this war
3ZtV0HsYzmg,i just loved his interviewhe was nice and direct
3ZtV0HsYzmg,we live in an era where being right and having something to say is often prioritised over genuinely trying to find peaceful resolutions that benefit everyone
3ZtV0HsYzmg,see official ukranian news and military  webpages they dont call it war either 
3ZtV0HsYzmg,the dynamics of the interview in the full russian version are very different from this extract
3ZtV0HsYzmg,thats okay we in the uk are not sending weapons to the ukrainians so all is well
3ZtV0HsYzmg,also russia these are not the droids youre looking for
3ZtV0HsYzmg,thank you for reporting this war and asking some tough questions to this cynical man
3ZtV0HsYzmg,putin the butcher
3ZtV0HsYzmg,congratulations on your interview with joseph goebbels i mean sergey lavrov either one brings equal prestige and illumination of the truth
3ZtV0HsYzmg,well no one can be guilty of special military operation crimes or be responsible for prisoners of smo
3ZtV0HsYzmg,his reasons for invading ukraine change everytime he speakswhat happened to the nazis what happened to the demilitarization it is has always been about taking land that they want
3ZtV0HsYzmg,cares only about international law  ukraine is recognized by international law as a sovereign state also by the russian signed budapest memorandum
3ZtV0HsYzmg,thats funny i dont remember them saying that this was a criminal action taken by nato at the beginning of russias declaration of this special military operation
3ZtV0HsYzmg,the title of leo tolstojs bestseller has been changed to spesial military operations and peace
3ZtV0HsYzmg,i wish ukraine get justice and save  god bless you ukraine and ukraine family and army
3ZtV0HsYzmg,if he dodge the question then the answer might as well be no because otherwise hed probably have said they will not do more special operations
3ZtV0HsYzmg,these are not economic sanctions they are special economic operations
3ZtV0HsYzmg,im with him on the point of mercenaries
3ZtV0HsYzmg,these arent the droids youre looking for if it worked for obiwan it can work for russiamaybe
3ZtV0HsYzmg,just as there is no war in ba sing se
3ZtV0HsYzmg,this gives the same feeling of there is no war in ba sing se
3ZtV0HsYzmg,oceania was at war with eastasia oceania had always been at war with eastasia
3ZtV0HsYzmg,can a country please do a special military operation in russia so they feel the pain that ukraine is feeling
3ZtV0HsYzmg,i love it its like when people try to convince me the earth is round when its clearly flat with mountains and valleys
3ZtV0HsYzmg,go on then do it  sounds like he wants it to be over soon
3ZtV0HsYzmg,invasion an instance of invading a country or region with an armed force
3ZtV0HsYzmg,im a big fan of steve rosenberg i always stop and listen if i see one of his reports
3ZtV0HsYzmg,go on then do it   easy to say when your leader sends others to the carnage while your ass is safe well fed and satisfied

Y8PIcsCtA_k,its nice to see matt enjoy his french frys
Y8PIcsCtA_k,im just curious if he ate the birthday candles too
Y8PIcsCtA_k,i picked the rice cause im kinda aisan
Y8PIcsCtA_k,stonie eating the cake reminded me of the fat kid who had to eat the chocolate cake in matilda that kid was a legend
Y8PIcsCtA_k,i dont know why but this challenge gets me really satisfied
Y8PIcsCtA_k,his dog coming in the video occassionally and peeping at the table is the cutest thing ever 3
Y8PIcsCtA_k,matt should get a award called most food eaten by a man in his entire life
Y8PIcsCtA_k,matt on the phone with his friend
Y8PIcsCtA_k,i love that dog man in every video he is curious 
Y8PIcsCtA_k,matt  ignites candles and then blows them instantly
Y8PIcsCtA_k,can we appriciate how nice the cake looks
Y8PIcsCtA_k,i guess his mom never had to worry about him finishing his food
Y8PIcsCtA_k,matt should be a motivational speaker
Y8PIcsCtA_k,i picked the bowl of rice cause im kind of asian
Y8PIcsCtA_k,why do i always watch matt with an empty stomach

RfQAe9vMqgI,i dont mind parents showing affection but kids deserve boundaries too
RfQAe9vMqgI,kourtney loves to set boundaries for herself but wont respect her kids boundaries
RfQAe9vMqgI,the kids are clearly uncomfortable they should have some respect not for themselves but at least for the kids who have no way to exit out of the situation
RfQAe9vMqgI,this is very disrespectful weve all been in love and we know how it feels but we still know how to control ourselves especially in front of children
RfQAe9vMqgI,if kids are saying something that means is too much this people are old to be acting like that they are almost hitting menopause
RfQAe9vMqgI,thats horrible poor kids so heartbreaking
RfQAe9vMqgI,im all for pda but if your kids are uncomfortable with it then please respect their feelings and keep the pda for when theyre not around
RfQAe9vMqgI,kendall saying kourtney is her least favorite parent is very understandable
RfQAe9vMqgI,okay we get it youre in love its like theyre trying to prove it or something theyre making everybody uncomfortable i cant imagine how uncomfortable those poor kids must be
RfQAe9vMqgI,i dont get how they think its okay doing this in front of their kids im sure all kids would feel uncomfortable seeing them do that
RfQAe9vMqgI,scott disick is somewhere rolling his eyes  but seriously they should restrain kissing in front of their children it is upsetting to them
RfQAe9vMqgI,shes too old to be behaving this way her kids are going to disrespect her like they do kris
RfQAe9vMqgI,its gonna be soooo hilarious when all this lust runs out
RfQAe9vMqgI,the fact that the kids know what french kissing is
RfQAe9vMqgI,their definitely doing the most you dont do that stuff in front of your kids constantly
RfQAe9vMqgI,you dont have to make out in front of your kids lord have mercy thats nasty  go to the bedroom please
RfQAe9vMqgI,and penelope already knows what a french kiss is lol
RfQAe9vMqgI,at this point im sure theyre doing it for the show
RfQAe9vMqgI,this over display of affection is to continually antagonize both  their exes for sure both travis and kourtney will get tired of drooling on each other
RfQAe9vMqgI,they cant wait until they have their moment privately why do it in front of the kids
RfQAe9vMqgI,a childs mind and heart are fragile despite every single time penelopes pleading they are continuously hurting children
RfQAe9vMqgI,i think its good to show affection like hiding hands hugging etc but making out and being all over each other is too far
RfQAe9vMqgI,the kids are uncomfortable they should really think about their feelings
RfQAe9vMqgI,the excessive pda is performative and weird they arent 16 and the kids are clearly disgusted
RfQAe9vMqgI,its honestly pretty sad bc kourt and scott have previously discussed their daughter already showing signs of acting out since her and scotts split
RfQAe9vMqgI,theyre disgusting
RfQAe9vMqgI,love how he casually brushes her arm down to get her to take elbow off the table after placing napkin neatly in the lap nice manners travis 
RfQAe9vMqgI,i cant imagine my mother behaving like this with her partner in public much less on national tv
RfQAe9vMqgI,i feel bad for the kids specially when kourtney doesnt kiss their dad
RfQAe9vMqgI,seems like a karmic relationship karmic means lesson i hope she learns her lesson in this relationship sex isnt love
RfQAe9vMqgI,chill on the pda in front of the kids clearly makes them uncomfortable and theyre going to end up resenting travis because of it
RfQAe9vMqgI,thats just ridicules so disrespectful for her kids
RfQAe9vMqgI,it is soooo kourtney initiating the kissing
RfQAe9vMqgI,with scott she had rules about everything i get that therere in love but still some things shouldnt be in front of the kids
RfQAe9vMqgI,this is so immature and inappropriate
RfQAe9vMqgI,everything momma k and daddy b do is so classic old school and private
RfQAe9vMqgI,enough obsession is not healthy  put your tongues away
RfQAe9vMqgI,love how kourtneys kids are not brand conscious but soo humble and simple
RfQAe9vMqgI,this is not love this is lust
RfQAe9vMqgI,they are so gross  and very disrespecful especially in front of children 
RfQAe9vMqgI,travis is beating that box to death 
RfQAe9vMqgI,i have a feeling those kids will have issues later in life  shame on the adults
RfQAe9vMqgI,a smooch quick peck is all kids need to see they will understand affection through that they dont have to see your foreplay occur
RfQAe9vMqgI,thats so immature middle aged adults acting like teenagers
RfQAe9vMqgI,love it  so cute how she mentions the certificates
RfQAe9vMqgI,its just too much for everyone throwing up in my mouth
RfQAe9vMqgI,well he looks like a keeper doesnt he
RfQAe9vMqgI,i think its gross so inappropriate for kids to see constantly grow the f up
RfQAe9vMqgI,respect is the truth  happy for both
RfQAe9vMqgI,im happy for them
RfQAe9vMqgI,the fact that kourtney was french kissing infront of her 7 year old child is pretty disturbing and clearly he thinks the same
RfQAe9vMqgI,do you think they have conversations like if they were banned from touching each other somehow what would they do
RfQAe9vMqgI,watching them makeout makes me physically uncomfortable
RfQAe9vMqgI,that elvis will have a good story for his grandkids
RfQAe9vMqgI,i would hate to be that embarrassed of my mum
RfQAe9vMqgI,her being happy and enjoying life is really pushing boundaries and she needs to be careful scott was way too good to her
RfQAe9vMqgI,he talks to her like a baby what does my baby want my baby i love you its a bit much
RfQAe9vMqgI,kourtney and penelope will be jus like kourtney and kris  the way kourt treats kris is a foreshadowing of the future relationship she will have with penelope
RfQAe9vMqgI,alabama is so cute
RfQAe9vMqgI,the kids just dont want their mom to marry travis lol
RfQAe9vMqgI,can they not do it on front of the kids if they are uncomfortable
RfQAe9vMqgI,its nice seeing courtney so happy
RfQAe9vMqgI,i will say kourtney appears genuinely happy and not as snobby i dont approve of all the pda in the kids faces as scott is their dad just imo
RfQAe9vMqgI,if the children are asking for it to stop they should respect the children
RfQAe9vMqgI,its a good thing for kids to see there parents be affectionate but making out in front of them is a bit to much
RfQAe9vMqgI,its not right in front of the kids that is disgusting n disrespectful
RfQAe9vMqgI,im so happy for them so glad kourt

8hH7AkHiINU,kirk makes me so happy always swinging running the bases hard a beast behind the plate and a smile when his team makes a play
8hH7AkHiINU,blue jays offence has been going off lately too bad hitmiss starting pitcher and a terrible bullpen has been kiling their chances
8hH7AkHiINU,they hit pretty well for not having a hitting coach
8hH7AkHiINU,great job by trent thornton keeping where it is alejandro kirk will star the 2022 allstar game
8hH7AkHiINU,that ump has killer instincts props dude
8hH7AkHiINU,blue jays need to win games more easily cant always let teams come back
8hH7AkHiINU,wellchicago missed the ump assistance today and it shows
8hH7AkHiINU,blue jay fan here those chicago jersey are fire
8hH7AkHiINU,the blue jays just need a little more tweaks and they will be a world series contender
8hH7AkHiINU,kirk is on
8hH7AkHiINU,white sox should use the chi hat as alternative permantely
8hH7AkHiINU,kirk continues to surprise me he doesnt look athletic but he can play ball
8hH7AkHiINU,the toronto blue jays are 3930
8hH7AkHiINU,looks like they heard about all the opposite field hits they hope my soxget well soon
8hH7AkHiINU,good think mayzas got that cake back there or getting a comebacker might have hurt
8hH7AkHiINU,montoya needs to start being quicker to pull out a pitcher no matter who he is and when in the game it is
8hH7AkHiINU,way to go blue jays
8hH7AkHiINU,the jays should have won the series  is a shame oh well on to the next series still lots of baseball  to play
8hH7AkHiINU,god bless that bo bichette always a tough out
8hH7AkHiINU,4k technology has been available for over a decade and were still watching mlb baseball in lowres
8hH7AkHiINU,way to go jays
8hH7AkHiINU,this is why bo is starting over tim in the all star game
8hH7AkHiINU,jays after two tough losses  lock
8hH7AkHiINU,el equipo quiere empezar una buena racha pero lucas giolito la echa a perder con su pitcheo para que practique el equipo contrario
8hH7AkHiINU,yeah but the blue jays have three catchers that could change the game what team in mlb can say they have three catchers that can change the game
8hH7AkHiINU,gio is done must make trade tlr needs to stop babying our players
8hH7AkHiINU,umm any explanation for the ejection
8hH7AkHiINU,maybe change up middle of the zone isnt a pitch you throw over and over giolito
8hH7AkHiINU,im starting to lose patience with lucas giolito im glad the sox took 2 out of 3 from toronto im also glad i dont have to see alejandro kirk anymore
8hH7AkHiINU,lets go jays
8hH7AkHiINU,kirk is the best hitting catcher in the league bar none
8hH7AkHiINU,bichette with the grand slam for blue jays to win over the white sox
8hH7AkHiINU,sox need to either fire their trainer or hire a full time yoga or pilates instructor we have way too many hamstring injuries
8hH7AkHiINU,kirk is on fire
8hH7AkHiINU,robert plays one game a week and cant run to first base so tired of this guy
8hH7AkHiINU,wow the white sox players dont run hard out of the box at all and abreu cant run at all on a positive note those white sox uniforms were sharp
8hH7AkHiINU,jays continue to show how poor and fragile they really are
8hH7AkHiINU,its not the hitting thats torontos problem
8hH7AkHiINU,the jays pitching and outfield need almost total replacements the jays have about 2  or 3 good pitchers and like 1 good outfielder
8hH7AkHiINU,blue jays vs white sox
8hH7AkHiINU,jays dolly partoned them
8hH7AkHiINU,i 3 alejandro kirk
8hH7AkHiINU,enough of leury garcia already
8hH7AkHiINU,ese lucas giolito ya lo agarraron los equipos contrarios de pitcher para practicar el bateoya lo deben de quitar del rol de abridores
8hH7AkHiINU,pitching and bad luck almost cost us again
8hH7AkHiINU,i prefer not being on 1st place
8hH7AkHiINU,i remember this bum giolito holding out for 200 million dollar contract probably a spider tack user or batters wised up to his high changeup gimmick
8hH7AkHiINU,gg my boi
8hH7AkHiINU,kirk reminds me of a hamster i once had
pmh7mq8Day0,wow what a series this is turning out to be highlight reel goals pushback by the lightning who wouldnt be denied and a little fireworks to top it all off
pmh7mq8Day0,what a win for tampa vasy and the entire team definitely stood their ground tonight
pmh7mq8Day0,lightning really needed this one after getting absolutely humiliated in game 2 i can only hope we get more competitive games going forward
pmh7mq8Day0,comparing pauls movement to a mens league player that was a hilarious rare candid moment
pmh7mq8Day0,anyone else getting reminded of the leafslightning series that one was also either one team dominating the other or a close game decided by a single goal mostly in overtime
pmh7mq8Day0,so many blocked shots by tampa they can never be counted out
pmh7mq8Day0,outstanding game from tampa here no idea where this series is gonna go next but im here for it so much action twists and turns
pmh7mq8Day0,great recap
pmh7mq8Day0,it has now been 24 years since the last stanley cup final sweep
pmh7mq8Day0,probably the most entertaining final for the last decade or two
pmh7mq8Day0,great effort by both teams 
pmh7mq8Day0,if you havent noticed the lightning havent liked being embarrassed since 2019 they tend to get a bit angry
pmh7mq8Day0,thats the thing about playoff hockey its never over
pmh7mq8Day0,a couple of defensive mistakes by colorado one disallowed goal for a one milimetre offside improved tampa bay and much better goaltending by vasilevskiy
pmh7mq8Day0,this so far might very well be one of the best stanley cup finals i have ever seen
pmh7mq8Day0,they seem to play much better at sea level
pmh7mq8Day0,this is the huge comeback for tamap after destroyed game 2
pmh7mq8Day0,well done tampa you gave colorado as much as you got on game 2 keep it up
pmh7mq8Day0,great job tampa bay you can reverse you can win watch you win on wednesday too
pmh7mq8Day0,what a huuuge save by vasy 
pmh7mq8Day0,this is the game they needed
pmh7mq8Day0,tampa looking like tampa finally
pmh7mq8Day0,the avs finally lose their first road game this postseason 71
pmh7mq8Day0,as a fan of the avalanche tampas first 2 goals were beautiful
pmh7mq8Day0,i see the bolts took that game 2 personally
pmh7mq8Day0,elite defence by colorado back to
pmh7mq8Day0,congratulations boltsfloridas best team is a ice hockey team
pmh7mq8Day0,can you feel the drum beat repeatrepeatrepeat
pmh7mq8Day0,nice to see another team besides the blues beat the avs
pmh7mq8Day0,thank you for finally showing a fight in the highlights
pmh7mq8Day0,well vasy turned up the god mode
pmh7mq8Day0,this was humbling to say the least
pmh7mq8Day0,this situation seems familiarrangers fans having flashbacks
pmh7mq8Day0,cooper is an amazing coach to get this kind of bounce back vs a juggernaut of an avalanche teamthat is impressive
pmh7mq8Day0,im gonna let the puck go in by itself faking the goalie perfect
pmh7mq8Day0,leafs fan here gg wp tampa solid as usual
pmh7mq8Day0,one assist one goal for sa majest
pmh7mq8Day0,i like the no tripping call at
pmh7mq8Day0,as a leafs fan i just can say
pmh7mq8Day0,that was an uncharacteristic game for the avs they gotta be fired up after this one
pmh7mq8Day0,darcy kuemper as useless as ever in the playoffs
pmh7mq8Day0,anyone who thought tampa is out already  i think they will take this to game 7
pmh7mq8Day0,tampa just showing tht they can score in bunches also im rooting for colorado but i know its not gonna be easy for them
pmh7mq8Day0,colorado just wants to bring it back home
pmh7mq8Day0,go lightning and by way of associationgo wings
pmh7mq8Day0,they are the champions for a reason aint gonna go quietly
pmh7mq8Day0,ive a feelin that the winner of game 4 takes the series
pmh7mq8Day0,so vasy woke up against the avs and they finally went back to 20182019 bolts playing style good adjustments now we have a series on our hands
pmh7mq8Day0,lets go avs just a bump in the long road take it back in game 4

XmKvwRZ-KKA,i have such a psychotic hatred for mobile game ads that i cant even watch mr glizzy judge them
XmKvwRZ-KKA,i love their  do it in 1 take so we only have to pay them for 1 hour of work approach to advertising
XmKvwRZ-KKA,its a little hypocritical for the
XmKvwRZ-KKA,flying gorilla is one of the only ad i ever watched wholy and also downloaded the game after it
XmKvwRZ-KKA,im forming a society is the best quote ive heard lets just hope they recast jared leto and tattoo it on his forehead
XmKvwRZ-KKA,im graduating today but seeing the ad that i sent making it into the thumbnail is truly the best moment of my life thank you big cc
XmKvwRZ-KKA,bro this just scratched the tip of the iceberg we need a part 2 to this
XmKvwRZ-KKA,some of these ads made me physically cringe so hard to a point where i had cramps however the lilys garden series was riveting
XmKvwRZ-KKA,my least favorite ads are the ones that have you play the mini game but it just goes straight to the app store instead
XmKvwRZ-KKA,going through a breakup rn and this video made me laugh for the first time in a few days thank you big a and editors 
XmKvwRZ-KKA,the fire emblem mobile games making more than the main series is definitely true
XmKvwRZ-KKA,oh my gosh thank you these ads are getting waaaaay out of pocket and i really needed someone to talk about it
XmKvwRZ-KKA,keep up the marketing mondays big a 3 i decided to go into a marketing undergrad program because of you
XmKvwRZ-KKA,i live in asia where this kind of ad is king literally every ad youtube showed me during this video was a mobile game ad with a streamer playing it
XmKvwRZ-KKA,theres a lot more ads for lilys garden theres a whole other plotline where her grandma is a murderer or something and even a series of live action ads
XmKvwRZ-KKA,the creator of the lilys garden ads really just went and made a whole soap opera for a mobile game netflix wishes they had that kind of talent
XmKvwRZ-KKA,i cant believe hustle castle wasnt mentioned once it has the most vile ads imaginable
XmKvwRZ-KKA,thank you for the absolute banger eriksenchee your hard work does not go unnoticed
XmKvwRZ-KKA,i look forward to the day that an ai can systematically create these games and their adds
XmKvwRZ-KKA,ive never in my life wanted to skip an ad more than i did watching this video jesus
XmKvwRZ-KKA,the apology ad is the equivalent of
XmKvwRZ-KKA,youre doing it wrong leveling up is not the only way to increase combat power
XmKvwRZ-KKA,loved the dancing lilys garden santa in the end 1010 thanks editor
XmKvwRZ-KKA,i remember fondly the first time falling for one of these ads and then the gameplay used in the ad not being in the game atfuckingall
XmKvwRZ-KKA,loved the video big a but i am absolutely devastated merge mansion wasnt in here truly one for the books
XmKvwRZ-KKA,mat pat has made a 17 minute deep dive into the intense lore of lillys garden its insane
XmKvwRZ-KKA,best mm to date thoroughly enjoyed every minute
XmKvwRZ-KKA,30 minute marketing monday thank you very much big a 
XmKvwRZ-KKA,big a should do an ad for his channel but filled with all the inside memes like coffee cow and glizzy hands
XmKvwRZ-KKA,i installed evony and it is actually a pulling pin type game it is also unironically harder than it looks its also extremely buggy
XmKvwRZ-KKA,watched the whole thing forwards and backwards great work big a your best one yet
XmKvwRZ-KKA,anyone who watched last nights the looker stream knows that the mobile ad people exist for real circle arrow crown hourglass arrowhead jacks
XmKvwRZ-KKA,this outro is golden please keep it for future videos i just want no context twerking animated santa to confuse the hell out of new viewers
XmKvwRZ-KKA,lmao the thumbnail is very environmentally friendly big as editor takes recycling seriously
XmKvwRZ-KKA,i spent about 1500 on top war i can confirm the ads for it you will never find anything like it in the game
XmKvwRZ-KKA,girlfriend sends me these ads sometimes good to see big a reacting to some of the classics
XmKvwRZ-KKA,watching this while doing my daily challenges in afk arena
XmKvwRZ-KKA,i think i say for all of us when i say eric did this one great
XmKvwRZ-KKA,the funny part is that the game at
XmKvwRZ-KKA,holy moly you got hades hes the king of the underworld in greek mythology hes a 5 star s rank hero
XmKvwRZ-KKA,im so happy flying gorilla is getting the recognition it deserves
XmKvwRZ-KKA,the live action lilys garden ads are insane if you didnt already watch those on stream id def recommend
XmKvwRZ-KKA,i saw an ad today and i immediately started having an unquenchable thirst for coffee dangit gh glizzy hands you really got me addicted
XmKvwRZ-KKA,i remember forgetting to screenshot the joker ad and telling my friends about it  they just told me to take my meds and denied its existence
XmKvwRZ-KKA,if this outro doesnt stay as the official marketing monday outro i will riot
XmKvwRZ-KKA,i cant believe big a didnt include the greatest lilys garden ad of all time where lilys dead grandmother is in the closet
XmKvwRZ-KKA,i actually cannot finish this video big a i dont have enough time in my day to watch you watch mobile game ads
XmKvwRZ-KKA,dude the state of survival ads are so amazing i always watch all of them
XmKvwRZ-KKA,this is the greatest marketing monday video of all time
XmKvwRZ-KKA,these companies paid atrioc to advertise them and he disguised it as a normal stream
XmKvwRZ-KKA,i literally downloaded flying gorilla purely because of this ad its actually a pretty good game ngl
XmKvwRZ-KKA,big a is so rich he will
XmKvwRZ-KKA,the ads confuse me sometimes the ad seems like a better game than the actual game sometimes the ad even seems like an easier game to make
XmKvwRZ-KKA,got fired from my job as an atrioc commenter today
XmKvwRZ-KKA,finally someone talks about these
XmKvwRZ-KKA,the little zoom edit at
XmKvwRZ-KKA,just wait till the cc sees the lilys garden game theory just his favorite combination mobile game ads and good ole matthew patrick
XmKvwRZ-KKA,ive seen a lot of top war ads and i really want to play whatever is in the ad
XmKvwRZ-KKA,editor did a good job i liked it when atriocs mouth got big that was cool
XmKvwRZ-KKA,the golden days of evony were when they used to use bikini models to advertise on banner ads on literally every website in the world
XmKvwRZ-KKA,he needs to react to the merge mansion story arc probably the best in mobile ads
XmKvwRZ-KKA,watching the lilys garden ad live on stream was interesting

g8sjdOjNxIE,do you think this could make geothermal energy the future of our energy grid get surfshark vpn at
g8sjdOjNxIE,i dont know if you will ever read this but your channel pushed me to start going to engineering
g8sjdOjNxIE,hey matt when the subject of geothermal came up i pretty much already knew the company you were going to feature
g8sjdOjNxIE,awesome hopefully all their tests go well id love to see this succeed
g8sjdOjNxIE,this reminds me of the drilling system in the hilariously bad movie the core only its orders of magnitude more realistic
g8sjdOjNxIE,this is certainly a cool option i think theyd definitely need to drill a deep test hole to demonstrate its ability to withstand the pressure
g8sjdOjNxIE,the ability to retrofit existing fossil fuel plants makes this very exciting and one of the more promising technologies for clean power generation for sure
g8sjdOjNxIE,this is an exciting development it will be interesting to see how it makes its way into the field
g8sjdOjNxIE,1 what do you do with the vaporized rock and how to prevent it from damaging the device
g8sjdOjNxIE,ive often wonderedwith the earth heating up would it not be possible to harvest this heat directly from the sea itself
g8sjdOjNxIE,excellent overview thank you
g8sjdOjNxIE,this is pretty amazingjust wish someone had thought about it sooner
g8sjdOjNxIE,this is definitely a topic id like you to keep us up to date on its so interesting this was an excellent and informative piece thank you
g8sjdOjNxIE,thanks matt very interesting the ability of drilling deeper in stable ground will make it more useful as energy source
g8sjdOjNxIE,this sounds amazing best technology i have heard in a while actually made me feel slightly positive about our future and getting rid of fossil fuels
g8sjdOjNxIE,this is amazing id be very interested in knowing what the fuel cost is for the electricity this would vary the cost by a lot and the emissions levels
g8sjdOjNxIE,thanks matt as always youve shone a light on a technology which certainly looks to have enormous potential and enormous potential is what we so desperately need these days
g8sjdOjNxIE,man i love this channel i get to learn about so much cool stuff thanks for the hard work matt
g8sjdOjNxIE,i read about this a long time ago and often wondered why it wasnt being utilised greatcto see it could be the answer to a whole lot of problems 
g8sjdOjNxIE,i really hope nuclear fusions exists in my life time i would love to see this technological advancement
g8sjdOjNxIE,this whole thing sounds super great especially the part of using the existing generators and infrastructure from old plants
g8sjdOjNxIE,what an interesting idea  and continuing to use existing decommissioned power plants
g8sjdOjNxIE,ill be watching for further developments on this thanks matt for a great presentation on another new idea
g8sjdOjNxIE,thanks for this penetrating video matt
g8sjdOjNxIE,this is awesome have you seen the hyperdrill by the company hyperscience
g8sjdOjNxIE,thanks for the excellent presentation  whats preventing the superrich oil companies from using this same technology for oilgas drilling  is this limited to geothermal for some reason
g8sjdOjNxIE,really hopeful technology cant wait to hear how its progressing
g8sjdOjNxIE,matt always at it with the puns
g8sjdOjNxIE,instead of energy production could this geothermal energy be used to create an ecosphere by using the heat to create an independent climate in the surrounding area
g8sjdOjNxIE,going to be interesting when they hit a pocket of natural gas or some other on foreseen thing
g8sjdOjNxIE,this reminds me of the move the core  doctor braz demonstrates high frequency laser ultrasonic waves to drill earth incredibly efficient to make the journey to the core
g8sjdOjNxIE,rocket drills have been a known technology for decades and havent taken off anywhere so im not convinced that this will get picked up either still interesting idea
g8sjdOjNxIE,the overlooked issue of renewable energy not really hear me out is its ability to provide continuous energy
g8sjdOjNxIE,i wonder if they could get a head start if they used dried up wells love this channel
g8sjdOjNxIE,technology and engineering are mindblowing
0vxvEf1coZQ,dan and jamie could get their own home diy channel together and everything would be just fine
0vxvEf1coZQ,we need more dan i was absolutely reeling after when working on high voltage be sure to use a metal chair so you dont have to do it again line

0vxvEf1coZQ,these two are really good on camera together
0vxvEf1coZQ,jamie and dan are awesome what a duo
0vxvEf1coZQ,all i learned from this series is that contract workers in canada are utterly worthless in every aspect
0vxvEf1coZQ,yet another episode of cool to watch cant afford
0vxvEf1coZQ,when youre working on high voltage electronics you use a metal chair so that if you screw up you dont have to do it anymore or come to work again

uRM0yMF0AtQ,i love how he doesnt talk or make unnecessary faceshe just eats
uRM0yMF0AtQ,i love how hes smiling cause he knows we are suffering on the other side of the screen
uRM0yMF0AtQ,pretty sure zachs parents are still waiting for his first word
uRM0yMF0AtQ,zach eating like a king
uRM0yMF0AtQ,i like when asmr channels never include the cooking and straight to the eating but this channel is still always good
uRM0yMF0AtQ,zachs hidden talent  smiling with his eyes 
uRM0yMF0AtQ,mozarella corn dog first bite
uRM0yMF0AtQ,imagine living with this dude imagine having him cook for u imagine all the goodness you would eat
uRM0yMF0AtQ,this guy is by far the absolute best mukbanger ive ever listened to ever
uRM0yMF0AtQ,how does he manage to eat more politely and cleanly than i do with a single bite
uRM0yMF0AtQ,i love that this guy always smiles and he enjoys what he is doing
uRM0yMF0AtQ,sometimes i think the way he smiles at us is his way of saying ha you wish you did but you dont have this
uRM0yMF0AtQ,the best part is that he could have a tv behind the camera and be watching anime the whole time with ear buds
uRM0yMF0AtQ,it looks like zach is living his best life and is happy when eat i have so relatable

uRM0yMF0AtQ,fun fact about zachchoi he cooks for himself sometimes
kW5X4dU0gnY,linus explaining to the audience what a crt is makes me feel really old
kW5X4dU0gnY,the crt i had 20 years ago was so heavy it bent my desk to u shape
kW5X4dU0gnY,congrats on owning an fw900 im glad to see this monitor being spoken about even after 20 years of it being made
kW5X4dU0gnY,its sort of amazing that it took this long for other display technologies to
kW5X4dU0gnY,it would be kinda cool to see crts come back with more modern technology to help them have better resolution and stuff
kW5X4dU0gnY,well if this cost you 3000 im sure theyre going to sell for 6000 now
kW5X4dU0gnY,i could never afford this kind of thing as a kid or teenager
kW5X4dU0gnY,i think crts are a big part of the reason that we remember old games looking better than when we replay them on our lcdled monitors
kW5X4dU0gnY,man so many years and modern displays havent fully caught up to crts
kW5X4dU0gnY,i always knew that theres something cool about the analogue old school tech from audio amplifiers to image displays
kW5X4dU0gnY,as a retro enthusiast its always awesome to see peoples reactions to crts when they havent seen them in over a decade d
kW5X4dU0gnY,i feel as if my mind has been opened to a new retro world  this is incredibly fascinating
kW5X4dU0gnY,cant wait for thousands of delusional facebook marketplace sellers to list their lowend crt monitors for 3000 firm
kW5X4dU0gnY,rip my chances of getting one now tt
kW5X4dU0gnY,doesnt that grill effectively force it to only work natively on some resolutions since it blocks electrons from hitting it at any possible spot other than the holes
kW5X4dU0gnY,im glad you made this i always thought i was a crazy git for remembering games looking alot better on my old crt
kW5X4dU0gnY,im glad people still talk about crt still have my old sony 22 hooked up for retro gaming just got secret of mana this week actually
kW5X4dU0gnY,it took me a long while to understand why everyone wanted antialiasing i never used it in the crt days because it always looked worse but now its basically mandatory
kW5X4dU0gnY,really interested to know how the dreamcast is connected to the monitor dc via vga is incredible
kW5X4dU0gnY,i always thought some company out there would start producing high endprofessional crts for retroproniche users
kW5X4dU0gnY,linus why do they not still make these
kW5X4dU0gnY,i got my first lcd display in 2014
kW5X4dU0gnY,so it took us 20 years to come up with good oled to catch up with 20 year old tech 
kW5X4dU0gnY,man imagine what a modern designed crt monitor would look like
kW5X4dU0gnY,interesting  i have a sony 24
kW5X4dU0gnY,im glad that whoever edited this video also knows how cursed it was that linus said one red one blue and one green and fixed it
kW5X4dU0gnY,linus remember those glow in the dark stars you had on your celling as a kid
kW5X4dU0gnY,cant wait for them to open up a tech museum with all the stuff theyve accumulated over the years
kW5X4dU0gnY,after watching this i will try to grab an old crt monitor and plug in my dreamcast and ps2 seeing the difference in this video is just mind boggling
kW5X4dU0gnY,its insane how much heavier higher resolution crts are compared to standard definition ones of about the same size
kW5X4dU0gnY,at my first postcollege it job i set up a bunch of sony trinitron monitors for our engineers  very heavy but such good quality
kW5X4dU0gnY,wonder if an analog driver for a dsl color wheel could be devised that would give back advantages of analog crt but projected onto a nice wide flat screen
kW5X4dU0gnY,this reminds me of my old 21 inch philips crt amazing resolution for those days but the darn thing weighted more than an average garbage truck
kW5X4dU0gnY,gotta love how old tech never seems to die and new tech is literally designed to
kW5X4dU0gnY,awesome you guys did this finally
kW5X4dU0gnY,thing is it would be nice if they kept updating crts to use for color work and for other fun
kW5X4dU0gnY,never understood the obsession with crts i always figured it was like the thing with audiophiles and their overpriced cables
kW5X4dU0gnY,with the dreamcast i can even tell the difference through my little phone screen
kW5X4dU0gnY,theres no question that nes is much nicer on a regular old television it actually looks good
kW5X4dU0gnY,so i figured this out with the wii  the standard def cables blurred enough even on big hd screens and it looked good but hd outputs looked very aliased
kW5X4dU0gnY,i believe nintendo had digital output on game cube for only a short time id be interested in seeing the analog crt compared to the digital on an led
kW5X4dU0gnY,windows  shift  arrow key might be the greatest tech tip i have ever heard
kW5X4dU0gnY,one quirk of crts that was mentioned which is amazing for retrogames is running a high refresh crt 320x224  240hz with black frame insertion my god
kW5X4dU0gnY,i mean im happy that crts are getting covered by yters of this size but at the same time the price of them are now gonna get even higher
kW5X4dU0gnY,i  miss my old crt i totally get what linus means about the solid crisp its right there kind of feel they gave you

kL9Ii47peBQ,shes not scolding her child shes just telling them
kL9Ii47peBQ,scolds is a bit much shes being so normal i appreciate this more human side to her
kL9Ii47peBQ,look what your teaching him
kL9Ii47peBQ,im hiding in the guest room because my kids wont leave me alone
kL9Ii47peBQ,if your watching this i hate you
kL9Ii47peBQ,kim having a sixth about her kids misbehaving is actually highly relatable
kL9Ii47peBQ,them kids wasnt saying nothing this is pr
kL9Ii47peBQ,from what weve seen on social media chicago seems like the chillest of all her kids
kL9Ii47peBQ,she seems like shes a really good hands on mom ive grown to actually really respect her
kL9Ii47peBQ,i love seeing kim with her kids
kL9Ii47peBQ,im not a kardashian fan but this had me laughing as a mom i can totally relate my kids would be doing the same dang thing
kL9Ii47peBQ,saint is so adorable honestly lol
kL9Ii47peBQ,north makes me laugh so much
kL9Ii47peBQ,im not even a fan of them like that and this video compilation of her with her kids is hilarious
kL9Ii47peBQ,regardless of what people say about her appears that she is a really great mother right
kL9Ii47peBQ,i love how outspoken the kids are  and kim is doing an amazing job as a mother especially since a  lot of kids tend to be shy
kL9Ii47peBQ,kourtney couldnt scold hers and control her kids i am proud of kim to draw the line
kL9Ii47peBQ,she seems like a good mom she was very patient and she didnt get loud or mean when she was telling them to stop
kL9Ii47peBQ,her son saying i hate you to the people watching her instagram live is very telling
kL9Ii47peBQ,i like how shes talking to them shes a good mom
kL9Ii47peBQ,i love to see kim being a mom
kL9Ii47peBQ,imagine being scolded by your mom and 1000 people are clapping to it

kL9Ii47peBQ,funny how when someone famous does normal every day things its glorified  kim eating with a spoon and fork then taking a sip of her drink
kL9Ii47peBQ,kim was like how  can i show off my kids you couldnt even hear them
kL9Ii47peBQ,nobody will say it but she gotta discipline a little morethis is going to get worse by teenage yearsbut khloe way of parenting is spot on in my opinion
kL9Ii47peBQ,one thing we learn as parents is that laughing at the behavior only encourages it sooo

tyl5_JOLxRE,wanna thank you all for the amazing support
tyl5_JOLxRE,my main issue with the skywalker saga has to be the lack of chacter customization very disappointing as a fan of lego games
tyl5_JOLxRE,id like to make a case for lego dimensions best character being sonic the hedgehog
tyl5_JOLxRE,dark pheonix always been a top pick for me in lmsh
tyl5_JOLxRE,skywalker sagas details with characters really surprise me
tyl5_JOLxRE,if we were going based off of abilities i would say the phase two clone trooper is the best one because it doubles as a hero and a villain
tyl5_JOLxRE,for lego dimensions i feel that chell from the portal set was one of the coolest characters in my opinion
tyl5_JOLxRE,i agree with a lot of these picks
tyl5_JOLxRE,when i was little i fell in love with dinosaurs and the jurassic world video game the jurassic park theme still gives me so much nostalgia for that game
tyl5_JOLxRE,lego city undercover needs a part two it is the most creative lego game ever and every second of playtime is fun
tyl5_JOLxRE,for lego harry potter 14 i would go with fang in freeplay he has an insane glitch where you can infinitely jump and its insane for freeplay speedruns
tyl5_JOLxRE,actually most characters from lego dimensions are now more expensive since you could be paying over 50 for some of them
tyl5_JOLxRE,slimer in lego dimensions is the most bang for your buck ability wise also the wicked witch is similar and gives you exclusive access to the oz world
tyl5_JOLxRE,for lego indy id of pick one of the soldiers with a rocket launcher that was handy for dealing with a lot of traps in the game
tyl5_JOLxRE,the only things i didnt like about lego indy 2
tyl5_JOLxRE,i agree with a lot of them especially general grievous
tyl5_JOLxRE,come on davy jones was the best potc character the sound his kick made was so badass
tyl5_JOLxRE,for me in the skywalker saga its bo kayan she has decently good weapons and can double jump and then use her jetpack
tyl5_JOLxRE,glad to see that grievous and the witch king are receiving love those two were my favorites
tyl5_JOLxRE,this must be the most underrated youtuber ever the editing is insane and he is just so funny d
tyl5_JOLxRE,grievous is the best in skywalker saga i think has access to the gun grenade and lightsabers can also use the villain loadouts which is pretty strong
tyl5_JOLxRE,i wonder if other lego games if given the skywalker saga treatment could be more interesting like pirates of the caribbean lotr etc
tyl5_JOLxRE,i swear the amount of times he talks about when he was younger you would think that it would become boring but its just not somehow
tyl5_JOLxRE,i would actually say that the ringwraith twilight is one of the best in lego lord of the rings because of how cool it looks
tyl5_JOLxRE,dark pheonix always been a top pick for me in lmsh flight laser invisibility and mind control pretty great honestly
tyl5_JOLxRE,for a next video you could rank every lego games flying mechanics  eg batman 2 visor batman 3 fuel mechanic jetpacks gliding mechanics throughout games etc
tyl5_JOLxRE,i remember playing lego worlds
tyl5_JOLxRE,great video i really liked it and made me remember about the games of my childhood gracias bro en verdad se agradece 
tyl5_JOLxRE,respect for mr freeze  in my opinion the best character in all of the games not just lego ones
tyl5_JOLxRE,in lego lotr i love the minas tirith tower guard the most i think its a special character too only on some discs he has sword shield and bow
tyl5_JOLxRE,for the new skywalker saga i would probably go with the droideka
tyl5_JOLxRE,for me heavy super battle droid from lego star wars 3 is kinda underrated
tyl5_JOLxRE,i think the lego pirates of the caribbean was probably my favorite lego game at the time i loved the levels and characters
tyl5_JOLxRE,lego pirates of the caribbean is one of my favourite lego games
tyl5_JOLxRE,i like how he played sweet child o mine as a reference to the new thor trailer and how thor is a lego character
tyl5_JOLxRE,if you need ideas do the best easter egg from each lego game
tyl5_JOLxRE,after watching this video i realize just how much lego content ive missed time to play a lot of these for the first time
tyl5_JOLxRE,this vid is edited amazingly you deserve more subs
tyl5_JOLxRE,i love the energy in your voice
tyl5_JOLxRE,the best lego city undercover character is definitely rex fury because hes the only one with a unique ability

NA_913whZ98,amber has difficulty crying when shes acting still rings true to this day so i ask et what tears are you referring to
NA_913whZ98,she cannot accept that it is just inappropriate to treat hit to taunt anyone like she has  the shear cruelty she reigned on him was incredibly unacceptable
NA_913whZ98,amber tears up
NA_913whZ98,it was 100 fair amber we could all tell you that in a heartbeat
NA_913whZ98,domestic violence has no gender dont try to destroy someones life with lies when yours can be destroyed with the truth dont play the victim to circumstances you created
NA_913whZ98,some people just cant apologize for their mistakes and take responsibility
NA_913whZ98,amber i dont care what anybody thinks about me
NA_913whZ98,i cant deal with her facial expressions and the forced emotions she fails so horribly to display its just unsettling to the core
NA_913whZ98,what tears and yes amber we can tell you this is fair it literally went through the justice system 
NA_913whZ98,as a dv survivor myself she disgusts me there is no way anyone being abused would speak to their abuser that way
NA_913whZ98,this is exactly why she got sued she cannot stop attacking him in the media regardless of her situation
NA_913whZ98,i want johnny to leave me alone
NA_913whZ98,the best thing anyone can do is simply ignore any interviews she does show her that we just want her to go away
NA_913whZ98,theres a certain level when one knows this woman is a hopeless case when she became so in denial that she truly and wholeheartedly believes her own lies 
NA_913whZ98,she speaks in a way like she expects to be quoted lol the monster lives in johnny half of johnny amber heard survivor
NA_913whZ98,very toxic person she just cant stop lying and manipulating horrible
NA_913whZ98,how can they make a judgment how can they not  thats what they jury is for
NA_913whZ98,sometimes the hardest thing in life is accepting the truth she just cant accept the jury saw through her lies
NA_913whZ98,you couldnt tell me that you think theres been a fair representation
NA_913whZ98,shame on those media outlets who keep giving her a physical abuser a platform to repeat her blatant lies over and over
NA_913whZ98,calling amber heard a domestic violence victim is like calling her an oscar winning actress
NA_913whZ98,this is brilliant  the more she talks  the more i respect johnny deep not launching her out the plane
NA_913whZ98,amber i dont blame the juries
NA_913whZ98,hes not a character hes a human being
NA_913whZ98,amber he is not only an amazing actor he also is a amazing human being its just a feeling
NA_913whZ98,does she really believe she wasnt allowed to speak on the witness stand wth this woman is in denial
NA_913whZ98,et is still trying to make people believe amber has an ounce of real emotion
NA_913whZ98,seeing this i really think she is beyond help
NA_913whZ98,shes milking this trial for all its worth because she knows that this is the most attention shes going to get due to her career being in the trash
NA_913whZ98,she is a true representation of narcissism never able to take blame or admit fault
NA_913whZ98,we love you and you won regardless of the result you won because you dont need to be around him
NA_913whZ98,amber it wasnt just about what johnny said your own testimony worked against you in their inconsistency
NA_913whZ98,ive been waiting for a single tear to come out
NA_913whZ98,i am able to i can definitely look at her in her eyes and tell her that it has been a fair representation of her in the media
NA_913whZ98,the fact she doesnt own up for her lies still said it all about her personality
NA_913whZ98,so are you amber heard youre a great actress too
NA_913whZ98,shes simply showing everyone how toxic she really is and what johnny had to live with
NA_913whZ98,johnny won not because he is a beloved character because he was telling the truth andthe evidence supported it
NA_913whZ98,shame on you for giving this liar a platform
NA_913whZ98,shes saying you cannot tell me this or that  this is her attitude   shes trying to dictate to people what opinions they are allowed to express to her
NA_913whZ98,yes it was a fair representation amber was caught in multiple lies before the worlds eyes
NA_913whZ98,she cant stop dr curry was so right about her her narcissism is beyond everything
NA_913whZ98,using the derogatory term to describe all those who testified on
NA_913whZ98,all you need to know about a narcissist is that they are always either the victim or the savior ah confirms this every time she opens her mouth
NA_913whZ98,the consistent thing here is that in her world shes the only one whos right and everyone else is wrong even if its the whole world

mm8nHolL0aM,love hamish his vocabulary respectfulness expertise opinions style  i want to see his lifetime of looks
mm8nHolL0aM,love the explaination so clear crisp and concise more vogue series with sir please
mm8nHolL0aM,shes staying alive for the fashion
mm8nHolL0aM,i would love to see princess dianas life in looks too
mm8nHolL0aM,im obsessed with hamishs energy and how he explains every single look with the greatest detail
mm8nHolL0aM,she isnt chic but she dresses like a queen   once said of the late queen mother and true of her daughter  queen elizabeth
mm8nHolL0aM,hamish bowles what a delight he is to listen to and so much fashion history tucked away in his marvelous brain
mm8nHolL0aM,not only is this man hilarious but also a great narrator please do more historical ones with him
mm8nHolL0aM,the fact that this dear man knows the designers of these dresses by name is just impressively baffling to me
mm8nHolL0aM,i really wish hamish can do his own life in looks i would be thrilled
mm8nHolL0aM,i love that he did it for her but if she explained how she felt in those outfits it wouldve been so cool i hope she is well
mm8nHolL0aM,i love the commentary both lively and respectful and of course our beautiful queen in that striking array of colorcoordinated outfits and hats a true fashion icon
mm8nHolL0aM,can we have a series with him  like a regular in between celebrities one celeb video one of him  one celeb video one of him  thank you vogue
mm8nHolL0aM,that glittering dress is spectacular i would have asked grandma for it too
mm8nHolL0aM,i would buy this book if they created one just wonderful to see and remember these iconic moments
mm8nHolL0aM,there should be a series with him absolutely wholesome v
mm8nHolL0aM,i demand more series with this gentleman of fashion hes so darling and wise plus hes handsome and so dignified looking
mm8nHolL0aM,i can have mr hamish bowles in every single vogue video and not be mad about it at all
mm8nHolL0aM,this was so interesting what great insight given for each photo
mm8nHolL0aM,1999 dress was the most unique something we dont expect the queen to wear yet so elegant
mm8nHolL0aM,i absolutely love bright colors it was a real treat to see how much the queen loves them too
mm8nHolL0aM,this man is impeccably dressed his suit tie cuffs colors are all perfection
mm8nHolL0aM,so interesting loved seeing her beautiful clothes and the reasons for them loved it
mm8nHolL0aM,such an amazing video i would love to see more on royal fashion
mm8nHolL0aM,wow to have your whole life documented for all time must be amazing love it
mm8nHolL0aM,i know this is petty but her being stunning without being blonde and pencil thin is a what tops the cake for me
mm8nHolL0aM,wow all i can say is wow
mm8nHolL0aM,i loved almost everything about this except  many of the photos of the queens fashion were so small  it doesnt make sense vogue
mm8nHolL0aM,stunning emotional and just beautiful thank you hamish
mm8nHolL0aM,i thought its gonna be the queen herself
mm8nHolL0aM,i wish they would pan slowly over each look top to bottom  theres so much detail to appreciate
mm8nHolL0aM,god bless the queen elizabeth ii 
mm8nHolL0aM,96th still looking great  my granny is already bedridden in her late 80s
mm8nHolL0aM,surprised he didnt mention the queen mary russian fringe tiara shes wearing breaking on her wedding day  wish he would have mentioned the jewels more
mm8nHolL0aM,the queen is a classic beauty not modelesque but pretty shes not too obsessed with gaudy outfits she always wears understated outfits
mm8nHolL0aM,nobody becomes a millionaire or billionaire by working for others and depending on them good investment breed millions of dollars and consistency breed billions
mm8nHolL0aM,i love that he can recall the details and dates at the drop of a couture hat
mm8nHolL0aM,she is one of the most respectful and beloved person in our time through decades
mm8nHolL0aM,absolutely loved the way this gentleman presented it all
mm8nHolL0aM,love or hate her cant argue how pivotal a role shes played in history
mm8nHolL0aM,my favorite of all episodes he did an amazing job  love the queen
mm8nHolL0aM,shes truly the epitome of class duty and honor
mm8nHolL0aM,ive been following hamish bowles since i was 13 and got my own subscription to vogue i love him
mm8nHolL0aM,following the different ways that royals send out messages is so much fun i could listen to the analysis of that for hours
mm8nHolL0aM,well done harish more iconic looks please
mm8nHolL0aM,absolutely wonderful video hamish bowles is brilliant and hmtq breathtaking thank you vogue
mm8nHolL0aM,he has the most soothing and comforting voice it would be so lovely to hear him do another one of these he should do more

mm8nHolL0aM,interestingi loved the 60s dress but i love 60s styles
mm8nHolL0aM,beautifully exquisite use of vocabulary knowledge expertise and enthusiasm just wonderfully edited and narrated
mm8nHolL0aM,this was so interesting and so well done thank you
mm8nHolL0aM,what a beautifully presented man one inherently totally trusts his judgements and comments  on fashion
mm8nHolL0aM,so beautiful hope to see one dedicated to diana and catherine in the future

TNl8pcd-eSI,then start making those religious organizations pay taxes
TNl8pcd-eSI,welp if you start using taxpayer money to pay for religious schools then take away tax exemption for religious institutions let the churches pay for this religious education as well
TNl8pcd-eSI,when i cant have my tax paying dollars go to funding for safe and legal abortions i sure dont want them going to religious education separate church and state
TNl8pcd-eSI,do they mean all religious school of all faiths  or is that limited to one specific religionis my humble opinion that this ruling is going to encounter many problems 
TNl8pcd-eSI,and does that also mean those schools cannot reject students due to them using state funds
TNl8pcd-eSI,an obvious 63 decision  yeah politics never plays a role in the law right
TNl8pcd-eSI,so we are going to start taxing churches  i mean if they are going to drawing from the pot  the least they can do is pitch in
TNl8pcd-eSI,paying religious organizations using my tax money via proxy of parents is still using my tax money to give to religious organizations
TNl8pcd-eSI,alright time to tax the church
TNl8pcd-eSI,if a church accepts money from the state for education then that church should have to pay taxes and lose their tax exemption status
TNl8pcd-eSI,just keep on erasing that line between church and state so lets have churches pay taxes
TNl8pcd-eSI,since theyre all getting money from the state it makes sense
TNl8pcd-eSI,yet forcing citizens to pay for the religious indoctrination of other children is also a violation of freedom of religion
TNl8pcd-eSI,appalling every day we inch towards a theocracy
TNl8pcd-eSI,great decision
TNl8pcd-eSI,as for schools of sharia by extrapolation can state funding also be used for abortion
TNl8pcd-eSI,so much for separation of church and state
TNl8pcd-eSI,separation of church and state that sounds pretty clear but i see were arguing semantics and interpretations again
TNl8pcd-eSI,and when they say religious education we all know what religion they mean and only that religion
TNl8pcd-eSI,this country deserves exactly the direction its headed
TNl8pcd-eSI,this will be extended to government funding of students at all religious institutions including colleges
TNl8pcd-eSI,iowa where i live has merit based appointment which works pretty good
TNl8pcd-eSI,time to expand the court
TNl8pcd-eSI,state sponsored religion bs
TNl8pcd-eSI,seeing this many comments opposing the decision makes me happy
TNl8pcd-eSI,awesome keep state out of religion
TNl8pcd-eSI,welp so much for freedom of association every tax payer in maine is now tithing to every church
TNl8pcd-eSI,a chaplainship to congress is a palpable violation of church state principles  of equal rightsjames madison
TNl8pcd-eSI,whatever happened to the separation of church and state this far right supreme court is no longer an american institution
TNl8pcd-eSI,that rule applies to religious schools of any faith
TNl8pcd-eSI,you must separate government and religion democracy 101 ffs
TNl8pcd-eSI,time for churches to pay taxes
TNl8pcd-eSI,he wont know what hit him
TNl8pcd-eSI,i can appreciate school choice i dont understand why this had to go to the supreme court that shouldve been handled by the state
TNl8pcd-eSI,so much for separation of bs and state
TNl8pcd-eSI,america becoming a theocracy
TNl8pcd-eSI,the scotus right foot is sliding on a banana peel and the left foot cannot keep the balance to prevent a great fall
TNl8pcd-eSI,separation of church and state
TNl8pcd-eSI,my invisible friend says spend that money on beer
TNl8pcd-eSI,tax em or burn em
TNl8pcd-eSI,as long as my pagan rituals and the importance of them be taught in public schools along side
TNl8pcd-eSI,did they also rule on abolishing separation of church and state just curious because thats what they have essentially done
TNl8pcd-eSI,its a voucher program
TNl8pcd-eSI,how bout parents just keep their money and government stay out of education like it should always have been
TNl8pcd-eSI,what happened to separation between church and state   its a taliban state now
TNl8pcd-eSI,i dont see any problem with that parents should be able to decide where they want their children to be educated
TNl8pcd-eSI,interesting and unusual is the reasoning for reporting this as news
TNl8pcd-eSI,great news  islamic school here we come
TNl8pcd-eSI,so these schools that take state money will have to follow state regulations correct
TNl8pcd-eSI,for the record
TNl8pcd-eSI,public schools need to now teach classes warning of the dangers of religion and teach its historic effects on mankind all of them
TNl8pcd-eSI,what about seperation of church and state
TNl8pcd-eSI,unbelievable  so much for separation of church and state  president biden please pack this court
TNl8pcd-eSI,whatever happened to the separation of church and state
TNl8pcd-eSI,he was fair until mixed up wall of separation discrimination is discrimination period
TNl8pcd-eSI,this is the correct ruling in order to separate church and state the state cant dictate where parents can and cant send their children to learn
TNl8pcd-eSI,the first clause in the bill of rights states that congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion
TNl8pcd-eSI,yay 
TNl8pcd-eSI,one step closer to a theocracy
TNl8pcd-eSI,separation  of  church state 
TNl8pcd-eSI,so separation of church and state is no longer a thing
TNl8pcd-eSI,we have had vouchers in my state for 20 years the private schools were 3000 a year before vouchers 6000 a year after
TNl8pcd-eSI,and the republican war on public education continues
TNl8pcd-eSI,since it is obviously inconceivable that all religions can be right the most reasonable conclusion is that they are all wrong
TNl8pcd-eSI,freedom from religion
TNl8pcd-eSI,were doomed
TNl8pcd-eSI,the church of satan is gonna have a field day with this one
TNl8pcd-eSI,im okay with this  as long as they also pay their share of taxes
TNl8pcd-eSI,soo all us non religious claim exempt on our taxes
TNl8pcd-eSI,bet bro just make sure they arent ods to fentanyl
TNl8pcd-eSI,yeah jose 
TNl8pcd-eSI,so much for separation of church and state
TNl8pcd-eSI,this is as big as the roe rollback 
TNl8pcd-eSI,when roe v wade being overturned already lol
TNl8pcd-eSI,can we use more money on public school education
TNl8pcd-eSI,so much for the separation of church and state
TNl8pcd-eSI,isnt separation of church from state in the constitution this should make the 2nd amendment fair game logically

IkT2pPfa8Ww,why are people all of a sudden surprised that trump threw a temper tantrum  he literally did it on the daily for his whole presidency
IkT2pPfa8Ww,when trump said he was going to be tough on china he was talking about the plates in the white house
IkT2pPfa8Ww,i clicked the like button as soon as i saw the title that andrew giuliani lost the primary
IkT2pPfa8Ww,trump behaving like a child who is always upset when things dont go how he wants is the funniest  saddest thing at the same time
IkT2pPfa8Ww,how his supporters still arent embarrassed by the big baby is beyond me  tossing food against the walls  like can you get any more toddler tantrum 
IkT2pPfa8Ww,you bring smiles to my world i appreciate it
IkT2pPfa8Ww,i mean of course whatever trump was eating for lunch involved ketchup
IkT2pPfa8Ww,andrews last name definitely hurt him in losing the primary
IkT2pPfa8Ww,someone who has long presented as a developmentally delayed sleep deprived junk food addicted toddler having a temper tantrum and throwing their food
IkT2pPfa8Ww,there were a solid 3 to 4 jokes in here that actually made me laugh out loud that was pretty good
IkT2pPfa8Ww,and hes getting suited by mr cleanlaughed at that longer and harder then i should have
IkT2pPfa8Ww,is anybody really surprised about trumps child like tempers
IkT2pPfa8Ww,benedict bonespurs lunch tossing tantrum isnt nearly as disturbing as his demand to lead his mob to the capital
IkT2pPfa8Ww,ill never look at a sharpie and heinz ketchup in the same way again
IkT2pPfa8Ww,is anyone still shocked by trumps behavior
IkT2pPfa8Ww,that would be funny if someone cleaned up the ketchup with french fries
IkT2pPfa8Ww,i cant believe trump would waste food like that
IkT2pPfa8Ww,that tiktok impression was perfect the whole show was on point
IkT2pPfa8Ww,i dont know why everybody is so surprised about the conniption we all knew who the donald was and is
IkT2pPfa8Ww,how dare you spoil the ending to surviving earth like that jimmy i was gonna watch it
IkT2pPfa8Ww,trump apparently never exited the terrible twos throwing tantrums and food
IkT2pPfa8Ww,andrews mothers married and maiden name may have been giuliani  as
IkT2pPfa8Ww,i had a hood fly up like that once on the freeway scary af
IkT2pPfa8Ww,donnie could have used a lesson or two from john belushi when it comes to throwing food
IkT2pPfa8Ww,i still have faith blackberry will make a comeback got mine on standby
IkT2pPfa8Ww,this is exactly why someone made ballons of trump as a baby wearing a diaper
IkT2pPfa8Ww,he threw food against the wall as expensive as food is
IkT2pPfa8Ww,pathfinder ironically sounded like a mitch hedbergs joke
IkT2pPfa8Ww,jimmy is on fire this week
IkT2pPfa8Ww,youre the best jimmy
IkT2pPfa8Ww,dump magic eraser is so sweet
IkT2pPfa8Ww,jimmy your great keep it going buddy
IkT2pPfa8Ww,never give humpty dumpty extra ketchup
IkT2pPfa8Ww,that back to the future bit was amazing
IkT2pPfa8Ww,jimmy left trump alone until trump attacked him for no reason  just some history for ya
IkT2pPfa8Ww,dt throwing his food  ketchupgate 
IkT2pPfa8Ww,theres so much ketchup on trumps wall its now considered an art of abstract expressionism
IkT2pPfa8Ww,its hard to believe trumps throwing full plates of food
IkT2pPfa8Ww,lock trump up lock trump up lock trump up lock trump up
IkT2pPfa8Ww,great dub on back to the future  2 thumbs up
IkT2pPfa8Ww,the little hand tho
IkT2pPfa8Ww,clean part looks good on you sir
IkT2pPfa8Ww,a back to the future musical brilliant is that for real or just a joke
IkT2pPfa8Ww,thank you visario  hope your life is better than anyones
IkT2pPfa8Ww,durum 2020 rick steve was doing his travel podcast at home with pretending to travel tips
IkT2pPfa8Ww,tell me you crush with moms without telling me you crush with moms
IkT2pPfa8Ww,awesome its been 15 years and i still havent bought an apple product
IkT2pPfa8Ww,my political ideal is democracy let every person be respected as an individual and no person be idolized dr albert einstein 1930
IkT2pPfa8Ww,ok that steak with ketchup made me almost 
IkT2pPfa8Ww,like your new howdy doody hair style jimmy  the stylist hit the nail on the head in howdys head the nail would have stuck
IkT2pPfa8Ww,anyone else see the dye job and just want him to go grey with dignity
IkT2pPfa8Ww,is there an eraser that can be used on trump rather than by trump
IkT2pPfa8Ww,that must be one terrible steak if you need ketchup to make it taste better
IkT2pPfa8Ww,not the biggest jf fanor back to the future for that matter but the musical was killer
IkT2pPfa8Ww,security deposit of your firstborn child
IkT2pPfa8Ww,how does fallon become an expert on anything 
IkT2pPfa8Ww,fully support banning tik tok and should have done it years ago
IkT2pPfa8Ww,trump definitely threw some hamberders
IkT2pPfa8Ww,trump the coup clutz clown is like rust and insanity
IkT2pPfa8Ww,hes the weak link in the chain of late night talk show hosts
IkT2pPfa8Ww,dont late night hosts ever get tired of their writers writing trump jokes for them
IkT2pPfa8Ww,thank god that giuliani lost the primary my goodness
IkT2pPfa8Ww,most of us are more than ready for some mean tweets and some 219 gas
IkT2pPfa8Ww,turns out nissan was using the term pathfinder ironically
IkT2pPfa8Ww,maaaaaaaan i have yet to see yall make fun of biden any of you late night show hosts biden fell off his bike thats just as hilarious
IkT2pPfa8Ww,when trump threw food with ketchup on the wall why no one asked him to clean up the wall
IkT2pPfa8Ww,trump definitely wasnt perfect ill guarantee you that but id take him any day over the clown thats running the country right now
IkT2pPfa8Ww,to receive ones spume while getting spooned that is the question im in
IkT2pPfa8Ww,the current president is throwing the whole country against the wall and its looking a whole lot messier than ketchup
IkT2pPfa8Ww,to the person reading this even though i dont know you i wish you the best of what life has to offer
IkT2pPfa8Ww,if you are complaining about gas prices
IkT2pPfa8Ww,and he is getting sued by mr clean
IkT2pPfa8Ww,the magic eraser wins
IkT2pPfa8Ww,trial by combat guy got a trial by conpat
IkT2pPfa8Ww,theres something different about jimmy  ive never seen him so blah
IkT2pPfa8Ww,im developing a crush on jimmy
IkT2pPfa8Ww,oh my god that clip from wholefoods is the one i use
IkT2pPfa8Ww,tik tok should be banned along with facebook twitter truth social and all the other antisocial networks
IkT2pPfa8Ww,the pandemic is not easing in fact the numbers are climbing at an alarming rate right now
IkT2pPfa8Ww,love trump

HjZ4POvk14c,well if pc is so good why dont they make pc2
HjZ4POvk14c,excited to see more but geez how many layers of embargo can valve have
HjZ4POvk14c,so if the steam deck is too big for linus small hands it means that normal  hands most likely will fit perfectly
HjZ4POvk14c,its so cool seeing the original htc one still get a casual mention years later was such a great phone
HjZ4POvk14c,good to know steam deck is being transparent about this and also fun watching linus get super hyped  about a perfect deck we all dreamed about as a kid
HjZ4POvk14c,assuming game devs get on board the best thing about steam deck will be wildly improved linux support for gaming
HjZ4POvk14c,really excited to see the huge potential with steam deck and looking forward to your full review of this device when it releases
HjZ4POvk14c,so impressed with valve always loved their work hoping that this thing continues their legacy
HjZ4POvk14c,massive respect to valve for being open with the drawbacks of the steam deck ill be getting one for sure come the next payslip
HjZ4POvk14c,linus that rubberbanding in forza has happened to me only when im online i believe its a server issue and not something with the hardware itself
HjZ4POvk14c,i love the steam deck its so bad
HjZ4POvk14c,watching linus get excited about tech innovations really just makes my day
HjZ4POvk14c,not going to lie ive watched a lot of videos on the steam deck and the most important thing to me is the software i cant wait to see that
HjZ4POvk14c,if i had the money i would order one right now great job
HjZ4POvk14c,oh dang a valve headset would actually be pretty nice with how well they engineer their hardware itd probably put my logitech headset to shame
HjZ4POvk14c,linus valve cant bend the laws of physics
HjZ4POvk14c,i was looking to buy one today looked for a review video found this now confirmed my purchase cheers linus
HjZ4POvk14c,good to know steam deck is being transparent about this and also fun watching linus get super hyped about a perfect deck we all dreamed about as a kid
HjZ4POvk14c,i would love to order this if they would sell it here in the rest of the world seriously valve
HjZ4POvk14c,as someone who travels often im very excited for this launch theres so much potential here its just cool to see this after being on steam since 2004
HjZ4POvk14c,i was wondering if i should pull my reservation for the top model steam deck but after this video i think i am comfortable with the expense
HjZ4POvk14c,is the antiglare screen also more scratch resistant
HjZ4POvk14c,literally just seeing you holding the steam deck in your hands with the picture on it looking so clear and crisp has me astounded
HjZ4POvk14c,i hope amd can come out with a cpu which is as efficient as the apple m1 that would be amazing for the battery life of devices like this
HjZ4POvk14c,damn that thing looks nice
HjZ4POvk14c,since valve released the cad files of the deck anyone could make a protective case without having a real deck on hands
HjZ4POvk14c,in all honesty i want this to succeed just so i can convert to linux fulltime
HjZ4POvk14c,with that rubber banding issue that happened with fh5 ive had that even on pc so definitely on microsoft side of things
HjZ4POvk14c,i wouldnt mind getting one if they ever go on sale the claw grip ill get is a concern though
HjZ4POvk14c,one small step for valve one giant leap for gamerkind
HjZ4POvk14c,my main concern would be heat and battery theres a reason you generally dont put x86 chips in this form factor
HjZ4POvk14c,its fun seeing linus get truly excited
HjZ4POvk14c,this is real i follow linus more than 15 years on internet and i never see him so excited like in this video well done valve
HjZ4POvk14c,great reviewvery indepth  this was like reading the manual but more fun   do people even read manuals anymore thoughlol  great job on your video 
HjZ4POvk14c,i think the forza rubber banding isnt necessarily the fault of the steam deck ive had the same problem on a windows pc with an rtx 2070
HjZ4POvk14c,im excited for the steam deck and the dock feature
HjZ4POvk14c,i cant say im surprised because valve almost never misses but im glad to hear this device lives up to expectations
HjZ4POvk14c,linus is like bill nye of the electronic world
HjZ4POvk14c,i cant wait to get mine originally q1 now q2 the only thing i dont like are the huge bezels i wish the screen was edge to edge
HjZ4POvk14c,i still cant believe this was not release alot earlier with steam gamesusers  and a handheld that can run them on the go is a gonna be a hit
HjZ4POvk14c,cant wait for this deck thats the ultimate gaming experience pc and handheld combined as one
HjZ4POvk14c,honestly i see dbrand as good people with just the right attitude that make exceptionel products
HjZ4POvk14c,hey linus
HjZ4POvk14c,this is exciting
HjZ4POvk14c,i own a steam controller not surprised that haptics are still valves weak spot though i wonder if the touchpads still have the specific issue that the controllers did
HjZ4POvk14c,if were calling this a gaming pc id say its the most innovative one ever
HjZ4POvk14c,dropping i cannot wait to see the next 510 years of more innovated changes
HjZ4POvk14c,that rubberbanding effect happens on pc as well for me it was my internet got my internet in order and it went back to normal or just go offline
HjZ4POvk14c,ive always thought i bet in the future well have pc graphics on a handheld device looks like the future is here and im excited to be part of it
HjZ4POvk14c,definitely looks like a cool product and it has crazy hardware features  compared to a nintendo switch though i wouldnt call it very portable because it is still very massive
HjZ4POvk14c,we need to see this dual booted windows and steam os a simple guide would also be nice i would only want windows for game pass
HjZ4POvk14c,dead cells works incredibly well on even old ios and android phones so i doubt theres an issue with the steam decks hardware
HjZ4POvk14c,i appreciate haptic feedback but tbh id rather just turn it off and have the extra battery life in any case definitely looking forward to the steam deck
HjZ4POvk14c,im looking forward to the full embargo lift
jROhT1Kx6_A,i love how his voice is deep  but his personality is a whole different level  from sounding mean and rude  to actually being sweet and nice
jROhT1Kx6_A,thanks for family entertainment bd
jROhT1Kx6_A,just owsam         
jROhT1Kx6_A,we need sustainable development

Xn0-dxIYYhs,great video youve remind me of what someone once said
Xn0-dxIYYhs,trump went to the standby line
Xn0-dxIYYhs,just watching trump and his clueless lemmings get owned is extremely satisfying
Xn0-dxIYYhs,bendiciones hermosa celina que dios te cuiden donde quiera que
Xn0-dxIYYhs,when trump reached for engels neck after trying to grab the steering wheel engel was heard saying keep your creepy little hands off me
Xn0-dxIYYhs,he is going to hurt when i am through
Xn0-dxIYYhs,maxwell only gets 20 years and rkelly gets life
Xn0-dxIYYhs,omg this is the  best hearing so far
Xn0-dxIYYhs,hearings are endearing him to his base
Xn0-dxIYYhs,im not a big trump fan  thought he would damage the cause of conservatism in the long run when he was elected
Xn0-dxIYYhs,got itsomething to the effect of
Xn0-dxIYYhs,what a champ this young lady to speak out about what happened
Xn0-dxIYYhs,out of the mouth of babes  sometimes young adults can easily see what is the right thing to do when the dysfunctional adults in the room cant
Xn0-dxIYYhs,i feel shes looking for 15min of fame
Xn0-dxIYYhs,its still up keep pushing the lie
Xn0-dxIYYhs,shout out to george floyd on 2 years of sobriety it took some tough love but he did it say his name liberals
Xn0-dxIYYhs,she is a famous liar now so she will probably get a book deal too
Xn0-dxIYYhs,still dreaming
Xn0-dxIYYhs,lying under oath is a joke in this place
Xn0-dxIYYhs,republican    bottom feeders greatest threat to humanity
Xn0-dxIYYhs,the earth shattering evidence ismore useless garbage what a joke of a trial
Xn0-dxIYYhs,our thoughts and poems are with the republic  democrats
Xn0-dxIYYhs,shes talking in third person  so what she says cant be held up in court
Xn0-dxIYYhs,what happened on jan 6th
Xn0-dxIYYhs,agreed some commentsuesless trial tax payer going to drainage investagation is wasting money and time they should investagate why gas prices are high inflation is more important than this investagation
Xn0-dxIYYhs,i prefer dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery
Xn0-dxIYYhs,she said he said no wonder this isnt an actual trial all the so called evidence would be thrown out
Xn0-dxIYYhs,trump was not in the limo but the suv  he still is lying

wLlL46pYcg4,15 spin launch
wLlL46pYcg4,you guys are really pushing all these great new inventions that will keep track of us all every second of every day until we die arent you  thats helpful  thanks
wLlL46pYcg4,i dont know which factors you used to rank these technologies but if the impact to society was one them then i dont see how
wLlL46pYcg4,i was totally shocked that fusion power generation wasnt included  possibly as big a leap as quantum computing in its impact on humanity
wLlL46pYcg4,floating farms will block the sunlight reaching coastal marine benthic life which may absolutely have a negative impact if and when implemented largescale
wLlL46pYcg4,great video very interesting subjects some of these might drastically change our world
wLlL46pYcg4,okaysolemme get this straightwe moved services to the cloud instead of having data centers locally only to move cloud services closer to reduce latencywhich was nonexistent before
wLlL46pYcg4,3d printing for real estate is interesting id like to see that progress
wLlL46pYcg4,woohoo star trek
wLlL46pYcg4,thank you this was fascinating especially the self healing concrete and edge computing
wLlL46pYcg4,the spin launch assuming my math is correct would release the capsule at over 5000mph neglecting drag and friction thats insane
wLlL46pYcg4,the production quality of this is absolutely through the roof amazing only legends will like this amazing video
wLlL46pYcg4,before you become too entranced with gorgeous gadgets and mesmerizing video displays let me remind you that information is not knowledge knowledge is not wisdom and wisdom is not foresight
wLlL46pYcg4,this sounds so exciting and i am amazed at how far humanity has come but a part of me feels a sense of sadness a yearning for simplicity
wLlL46pYcg4,i imagine that computers in the future will have standard processors and quantum processors integrated in the same box so that we will benefit from the strengths of each
wLlL46pYcg4,i read somewhere that the centrifugal launcher takes something like 2 days to get up to launch velocities
wLlL46pYcg4,nice to know that mcdonnell douglas old tech concept mass drivers are still at the forefront of todays new technology  just when will they get any credit
wLlL46pYcg4,imagine you are a construction worker and you are trying to demolish a concrete wall but it fixes itself lol
wLlL46pYcg4,its amazing how easily humans give up their privacy for a little bit of convenience
wLlL46pYcg4,i saw a documentary on pbs about hydrogen cars and that was 30 years ago  its amazing that we still havent found a way to harness that energy
wLlL46pYcg4,spin launch would make one hell of a weapon im surprised that the department of defense isnt working on something similar to spin launch for a weapon system
wLlL46pYcg4,what on earth is so great about different companies building their own satellite constellations and blockingdistorting our view of the universe
wLlL46pYcg4,quantum edge computing with blockchain would be among the best technology coming up
wLlL46pYcg4,honestly graphene dies seem like an incredibly useful material if it can be produced in large enough quantities
wLlL46pYcg4,what about the next nuclear energy reactors from smallmodular to thorium based and triso pebble bed reactors greenenergy cheap and able to be delivered all the time
wLlL46pYcg4,one little problem with the satellite tracking is that there wont be enough space for space travel because of so many satellites in orbits around the globe
wLlL46pYcg4,one of your best videos yet great stuff thank you
wLlL46pYcg4,15 spin launch  a different spin on mass drivers but okay sorry for the pun
wLlL46pYcg4,i was thinking of spin launch before i knew it existed wondering why everyone shot strait in the air instead of being hurled like an olympic throw lol
wLlL46pYcg4,cool video can you do one on medical technologies ie cancer treatments or neuroscience etc
wLlL46pYcg4,i really wanna try the graphene patches for pain ive got fibromyalgia and spinal cord damage so id totally test that out for em
wLlL46pYcg4,kinda weird that none of these techs mentioned involved directly improving human health
wLlL46pYcg4,things i missed in the video
wLlL46pYcg4,a question for the selfhealing concrete
wLlL46pYcg4,imagine an ai on a quantum computer
wLlL46pYcg4,thats a good idea i cant
wLlL46pYcg4,fantastic information thank you for posting this
wLlL46pYcg4,molten salt reactors will play a huge role in the development of safe nuclear energy
wLlL46pYcg4,floating farms can be used in places where the ocean has only sand surface beneath and thus has no use
wLlL46pYcg4,graphene is the most exciting tech on deck for me at least
wLlL46pYcg4,graphing must be taken seriously here in america  we must have this at our next tech summit snd purchase it and at t making it strong
wLlL46pYcg4,15 emerging technologies that will change the world
wLlL46pYcg4,or when i hear about block chain it makes me feel about how hard it is to get a gpu due to them being used for mining
wLlL46pYcg4,as always necessity is the mother of invention
wLlL46pYcg4,an better explanation of how a quantum computer operates is that a standard computer uses gate systems of zero and ones a quantum computer uses a plane system
wLlL46pYcg4,this video left a lot of things out
wLlL46pYcg4,yes they do  the system is perfect  they just dont want you to know how powerful it really is

SsSR23yv9ZE,im not crying
SsSR23yv9ZE,i feel happy for austin he looks genuinely happy with his gameboy thats so wholesome
SsSR23yv9ZE,seeing austin so giddy makes me so happy most wholesome episode of mystery tech ever
SsSR23yv9ZE,this was such a wholesome episode  its not easy to make a guy that has literally any tech he wants get this excited
SsSR23yv9ZE,now that austin is happy ken knows what he must do i cant wait to see next mystery tech
SsSR23yv9ZE,i feel like a huge nerd wearing this costume surrounded by mega pop figures
SsSR23yv9ZE,honestly this was nice to watch ive literally never seen austin this happy lol
SsSR23yv9ZE,when you live that pokemon life so hard you become a memethen you love the memesrespect the hustle
SsSR23yv9ZE,seeing uncle austin ken and matt just being so happy about all of the pokemon items and the z flip makes me so happy d
SsSR23yv9ZE,the hey guys this is austin makes me feels as good as hey all scott here
SsSR23yv9ZE,ive never seen austen this excited in a long time about time you guys make him happy instead of mad
SsSR23yv9ZE,im always excited to see these videos when they spend a lot of money on tech 
SsSR23yv9ZE,this episode felt like an infomercial but wait theres more
SsSR23yv9ZE,from what ive experienced the gb printer paper deteriorates over time
SsSR23yv9ZE,i love thinking about how anything he buys as long as he puts it in a video can be a tax writeoff because it would technically is a business expense
SsSR23yv9ZE,i just felt so good when austin catched roboraptor he always lets him fall
SsSR23yv9ZE,i love that apple finally puts an easily removeable battery in a product but its the one item i would rather people couldnt easily remove the battery
SsSR23yv9ZE,dont think ive seen austin more happy on mystery tech im happy for that guy
SsSR23yv9ZE,im loving these mystery boxes
SsSR23yv9ZE,love your vids man keep up the great work
SsSR23yv9ZE,this is probably my most favorite episode of mystery tech
SsSR23yv9ZE,oh nooo you broke it also that massive box p
SsSR23yv9ZE,probably the best episode of mystery tech yet
SsSR23yv9ZE,i love how austin can make things that are cool uncool in seconds
SsSR23yv9ZE,this has to be one of the best episodes ever that game boy is amazing
SsSR23yv9ZE,austin was a real kid in this episode that was very nice to watch it made me smile a lot 
SsSR23yv9ZE,the pokemon tcg gb game is one of my favorites and its also just hilarious
SsSR23yv9ZE,if my friends had a youtube channel and actually knew anything about tech it would be this and i love it
SsSR23yv9ZE,ken is like the big brother who gives everything to austin with austins money to make him look rad
SsSR23yv9ZE,bought a car once and there was an active tile tracker in it smashed rather quickly
SsSR23yv9ZE,this was the perfect episode for something like austins birthday because it looked to be the happiest episode so far lol
SsSR23yv9ZE,this episode is wholesome af
SsSR23yv9ZE,hey austin i have a quick question
SsSR23yv9ZE,so much good stuff from back then every package thrown at austin reminds me of my bittersweet childhood 
SsSR23yv9ZE,yall had a lot of fun with this one
SsSR23yv9ZE,this episode made me happy in a nostalgic sense
SsSR23yv9ZE,can we just take a moment to appreciate that apple made a dowsing machine in real life
SsSR23yv9ZE,this episode was fantastic
SsSR23yv9ZE,im genuinely happy for austin dressed as ash ketchum way to go matt and ken
SsSR23yv9ZE,ahh apple being enviornently friendly with all their products
SsSR23yv9ZE,hands down the best mystery tech episode ever
SsSR23yv9ZE,this might be the happiest austin is on a mystery tech video
SsSR23yv9ZE,the episode was less of a mystery tech stuff but more of a pokmon mania making austin go crazy
SsSR23yv9ZE,this is the happiest ive ever seen austin its so wholesome
SsSR23yv9ZE,i think this is austins favorite episode of mystery tech
SsSR23yv9ZE,dude ill be excited if i got one of those gameboys autographed by you 
SsSR23yv9ZE,honestly i like this kind of video and not about buying pc and other stuff  this is much more fun
SsSR23yv9ZE,nothing like apple to take something so simple and make it complicated and expensive that needs expensive accessories
SsSR23yv9ZE,austin evans is the best roboraptor dad he got that dad reflex when it started walking off the table
SsSR23yv9ZE,nice to see him really happy 
SsSR23yv9ZE,the tcg game was surprisingly fun all the pokemon games with accessories are insane  now cib even heartgoldsoulsilver to a degree if it was sealed i couldnt imagine
SsSR23yv9ZE,when austin tried to do a impression of ash he instead did a near flawless impression of meowth
SsSR23yv9ZE,at this point i gotta believe you guys love burning money
SsSR23yv9ZE,officially my favorite episode long live gameboy
SsSR23yv9ZE,ive thought about using an airtag for my cat any idea if that would be a good thing to do or no
SsSR23yv9ZE,theres only one song we can listen to absolutely perfect
SsSR23yv9ZE,actually havent seen austin this happy in a while
SsSR23yv9ZE,id much rather watch austin get excited about  a gameboy than other rich youtubers buying it for the views and then tossing it aside this is just great to watch
SsSR23yv9ZE,what a cool ad for apple airtags
SsSR23yv9ZE,no one makes good electronic videos like austin evans
SsSR23yv9ZE,dude those air tags would actually be very useful with my keys and my sony xm3s
SsSR23yv9ZE,little clickbaity but good vid
SsSR23yv9ZE,this is the most wholesome mystery tech lmao
SsSR23yv9ZE,i bet they will be worth quite a bit in like 10  15 years
SsSR23yv9ZE,i loved the printer d i took so many pictures of me and my pokemon in johto and printed them x3
SsSR23yv9ZE,you know your rich when your reaction to your friend giving you a ps5 is oh thanks
SsSR23yv9ZE,austin manages to be both a millenial and a boomer somehow
SsSR23yv9ZE,i like how the first thing austin wanted to put the airtag on was roboraptor
SsSR23yv9ZE,i love how if you click on the link to jake simmons it says check out psready
SsSR23yv9ZE,first time ive seen austin save roboraptor from falling good on him
SsSR23yv9ZE,oh heres a little tip when it comes to the gameboy printer if you get some thermal paper and cut it down to size it prints much better
SsSR23yv9ZE,this video made so happy for some reason definitely one of your best videos
SsSR23yv9ZE,austin needs lessons on dropping things from linus
SsSR23yv9ZE,i wonder who would dislike such an amazing video
SsSR23yv9ZE,yooo when austin started jumping around happy about using his z flip to charge the game boy
SsSR23yv9ZE,can we just acknowledge the dreamville shirt for a second because damn thats just immaculate taste
SsSR23yv9ZE,the fact that the ps5 model was broken means you can get your money back since te item arrived damaged
SsSR23yv9ZE,when he said tiktok is great and also did sheeeesh i just i went no
SsSR23yv9ZE,it wouldve been real cool if there was raspberry pi inside that tiny ps5

dHc7MW6x0JQ,i appreciate that she didnt only focus on the womens side men need to understand fertility too
dHc7MW6x0JQ,mother nature designed us to have 10 kids by the age of 25 and then die of exhaustion at the age of 40
dHc7MW6x0JQ,it breaks my heart that people who have miscarriages still have pregnancy symptoms afterwards that would be so hard
dHc7MW6x0JQ,i love how she equally addressed men and women in this video i feel like sometimes the focus is on women when its really a two person process
dHc7MW6x0JQ,would love another video focused on pcos and endo issues this was extremely informative and should definitely be shown in schools
dHc7MW6x0JQ,me who has no desire for children or to become pregnant completely invested and absorbing every bit of info in this video possible

dHc7MW6x0JQ,give this woman a netflix deal great familiar tone and simple answers kind and warm and informative i dont even care about fertility but shes a great watch
dHc7MW6x0JQ,it feels illegal to watch this for free because i just learned so many things
dHc7MW6x0JQ,i really wish we had a teacher like her in school
dHc7MW6x0JQ,i love how she stayed professional even after reading so many asking for a friend tags

dHc7MW6x0JQ,i never heard of older sperms causing disabilities i thought only the sperm count was decreased with age good to learn
dHc7MW6x0JQ,this video is so informative i love the way dr chen explains things can we have her for another video please
dHc7MW6x0JQ,i wouldve liked to ask does taking oral birth control for many years have any affect on fertility what about birth control where you skip periods
dHc7MW6x0JQ,me a woman who never wants children watching this video because its interesting
dHc7MW6x0JQ,she is so passionate and she feels so kind love her

dHc7MW6x0JQ,reproduction is literally in the national interest of any country i cant fathom why parents have to pay to deliver more workers to the machine love this woman
dHc7MW6x0JQ,i want this woman to be my doctor shes so comfortable and seems so easy to talk to
dHc7MW6x0JQ,the fact this type of video gets extremely less views than lots of videos with such least effort out there is outrageous
dHc7MW6x0JQ,informative video dr serena seems super knowledgeable but is also a great communicator 
dHc7MW6x0JQ,love listening to her thanks for the insights
dHc7MW6x0JQ,felt seen and heard when she mentioned pcos polycystic ovarian syndrome

u6DYuipcwiE,hey death gamers i did this series out of order but now were back on track
u6DYuipcwiE,i literally just rewatched your other werewolf games and wondered to myself if there were others 2 days later you bring this gem to us
u6DYuipcwiE,lets be honest even if we somehow end up in such game well die anyway due to bad decisions due to stress
u6DYuipcwiE,if mr beast had a werewolf in real life cinema summary should definitely participate
u6DYuipcwiE,a good strategy would be to sneakily ask everyones name at the start for example by asking everyone to introduce themselves
u6DYuipcwiE,two things
u6DYuipcwiE,okay so i just wanted to point out that making a fire with glasses is near impossible as you point out in min
u6DYuipcwiE,awesome video as always i dont know why but i cant seem to stop watching these death game movies
u6DYuipcwiE,after watching all of these how to beat i feel like i could easily survive one in reality id probably die first
u6DYuipcwiE,this is one of my favourite series of the channel im so happy for this
u6DYuipcwiE,the one problem with your strategy is if you correctly call out one of the werewolves the other werewolf will come straight for you
u6DYuipcwiE,awesome video
u6DYuipcwiE,at this point the asian highschool death game thing should just become a genre
u6DYuipcwiE,this girl changed into a jackson pollock painting
u6DYuipcwiE,im so happy to see you continuing this series i found out theres like eight of these and i was hoping youd cover more of the series thank you
u6DYuipcwiE,i love this channel and it brings me a lot of joy to see the smart side of conquering horror movies thanks
u6DYuipcwiE,lets be honest if you were in this situation you wouldnt remember a damn thing he said
u6DYuipcwiE,im in tears
u6DYuipcwiE,im in my 16th winning streak in the town of salem game all thanks to cinema summary advice
u6DYuipcwiE,am i the only one who wants cinema summary to stream himself playing the quarry
u6DYuipcwiE,im looking forward to your review on the rest of the series mad land was particularly good
u6DYuipcwiE,ahh this one is based on the manga 
u6DYuipcwiE,so happy that you are continuing the series looking foward to seeing lovers and mad land covered
u6DYuipcwiE,if cinema summary ever pulls up to the death game you know youre about to be a meat shield
u6DYuipcwiE,i love it when cinemasummary makes werewolf game videos i hope to see more in the future as theres more movies to cover like the 2020 werewolf games operator
u6DYuipcwiE,lets be real if we were in this wed all die because of emotional stress stress and bad decision making
u6DYuipcwiE,id imagine we might cover every film in this series practically  interesting that films are using parlor and childhood games to create death games
u6DYuipcwiE,the series that got me to this channel glad to see more of this
u6DYuipcwiE,this is my favorite series youve done so far keep going and good job
u6DYuipcwiE,man it would be fun if you and nerd explained did a collab guys like make it happen
u6DYuipcwiE,man im gonna go back to this channel i missed it
u6DYuipcwiE,yes another werewolf game i need to be prepared just in case
u6DYuipcwiE,as someone who plays werewolf irl i can confirm some players dont think logically no matter what their role is
u6DYuipcwiE,ah here comes the werewolf cinematic universe but im seriously surprised that they did three movies of this must be really popular
u6DYuipcwiE,my among us experience means this game would be easy
u6DYuipcwiE,would love to see him analyse an episode of sidemen among us or among us in general
u6DYuipcwiE,light from death note would beat this game in 30 seconds
u6DYuipcwiE,the manga was pretty good its cool they made a movie out of it its less violent though
u6DYuipcwiE,ok now this is interesting they all connect the survivors are never truly free from the game
u6DYuipcwiE,was waiting for this for ages thanks great video
u6DYuipcwiE,my drama class plays this without the whole murder part and i always win because of this channel
u6DYuipcwiE,lets be honest we will never get in this situation but hes super entertaining to watch
u6DYuipcwiE,you know theyre screwed when cinema summary says this was their biggest mistake
u6DYuipcwiE,who else keeps watching this series because you dont bother to go on netflix
u6DYuipcwiE,love this series  please continue this and make more of these vids
u6DYuipcwiE,youre one of my favorite channels seriously love all your videos
u6DYuipcwiE,love this series found about it through your chanel and was highly surprised my favourite is lovers then mad land hope to see your review about those one day
u6DYuipcwiE,these people in the back are more likely to be introverts
u6DYuipcwiE,i remember playing this game in middle school such good memories
u6DYuipcwiE,is this a prequel to one of the other werewolf games it certainly lines up right
u6DYuipcwiE,could you do more of this series this is so nice
u6DYuipcwiE,cant the villagers just make each other draw their cards the werewolves wouldnt know what the villager card would look like so they cant draw it properly
u6DYuipcwiE,ah yes the game you play in a hostel full of people you just met and make enemies with immediately
u6DYuipcwiE,i always thought if you were about to be killed that shouting the names of the werewolves would be a good strategy so everyone else can live
u6DYuipcwiE,im so excited for another death game video
u6DYuipcwiE,imagine you wake up in a death game with your best friend only for her to die from going outside and being thrown out the window with you watching her

5ziraX8V-x0,brb flexsealing the rest of my computers
5ziraX8V-x0,its hilarious hours casually they say are you ready to put water on a hard drive
5ziraX8V-x0,i can tell austin is having so much fun doing these hacks
5ziraX8V-x0,ok cool confirmed i can now flex seal my gaming and streaming pcs so we dont have to worry about water or dust build up ever again
5ziraX8V-x0,austin then tech reviewer
5ziraX8V-x0,you should have used the harddrive as a boot drive i wouldve liked to see what would happened
5ziraX8V-x0,i literally cant get decently priced components to save my life and these goobers are smacking gpus with golf clubs and spraying motherboards with flex seal
5ziraX8V-x0,tiktok tech hacks need to stop
5ziraX8V-x0,when i built my first pc i accidentally bent a few pins and broke a couple of pins on my cpu and i installed it and it ran perfectly
5ziraX8V-x0,austin your videos crazy im really proud of you
5ziraX8V-x0,this was amazing once i get enough money i want to become similar to you guys thank you and keep up the amazing work
5ziraX8V-x0,austin ive been watching you since the very first apartment you moved in
5ziraX8V-x0,has anyone tried flex seal to deal with condensation on those super chiller setups or does the extreme cold crack the coating
5ziraX8V-x0,the pins can be broken and still work  some control specific ram slots
5ziraX8V-x0,everything about this video feels wrong lol purposely breaking computers for content love it
5ziraX8V-x0,you should buy some old ddr2 or worse motherboards i had one with about 50 broken pins and it was still working
5ziraX8V-x0,flex seal motherboard might be the play for ln2 overclocking
5ziraX8V-x0,using the slow mo sound effect without a phantom camera should be a crime
5ziraX8V-x0,actually you can literally wash circuit boards in water so the of flex seal one isnt that amazing
5ziraX8V-x0,i couldnt stop laughing at the close up of austin evans
5ziraX8V-x0,i love how austin keeps saying 10 seconds 10 seconds as if every time he says 10 seconds the timer is starting from 10 seconds lol
5ziraX8V-x0,austin and adam casually destroying my dream pc parts
5ziraX8V-x0,he hid the money in the pc
5ziraX8V-x0,first person i could tell would be genuinely nice to austin
5ziraX8V-x0,holy crap thats awesome you got him to do a video with you  loved the video
5ziraX8V-x0,you should completely waterproof it and submerge it in water then it is a literal water cooled pc lol
5ziraX8V-x0,best case scenario  i see what you did there
5ziraX8V-x0,this is at 240fps   aight damnit someone get the slow mo guys down there
5ziraX8V-x0,i did not expect this collab but my 2 favourite pc content creators collabing im not complaining
5ziraX8V-x0,breaking working components this just doesnt sit work well with me  even if its old or not quite well its still useful for someone  rip pc
5ziraX8V-x0,i love how super cringe these tests are
5ziraX8V-x0,remember when this was a tech channel
5ziraX8V-x0,during the golf portion i got an ad and the first thing the ad said was we all know gpus are hard to find right now
5ziraX8V-x0,austin i am going unplug it from the wall really quick
5ziraX8V-x0,ngl i loved the energy in this video got me hype just watching it
5ziraX8V-x0,the flex seal hack is almost exactly what we do for xoc using ln2
5ziraX8V-x0,im going to gently unplug this from the wall while not gently turning off the pc
5ziraX8V-x0,austin laughed like if goofy was falling off a cliff
5ziraX8V-x0,how is pouring water on hdd a hack lmao
5ziraX8V-x0,you should do a broke vs pro with linus or anthony
5ziraX8V-x0,i think the coats of flex seal are supposed to be much thinner for the first couple coats then get a little thicker
5ziraX8V-x0,i cut this pc in half and fixed it with flex tape
5ziraX8V-x0,austin i love you and you videos
5ziraX8V-x0,flex seal it again and then submerge it fully
5ziraX8V-x0,the collab ive always wanted
5ziraX8V-x0,tiktok needs to stop
5ziraX8V-x0,i love this guys voice and watch all of his shorts lmao
5ziraX8V-x0,me wtf why isnt my hard drive reading or writing
5ziraX8V-x0,love the experiments
5ziraX8V-x0,the only youtuber i actually watch regularly
5ziraX8V-x0,lmao just connect the razer fan with an external power bank for extra portable performance
5ziraX8V-x0,they actually have vey balanced energies together
5ziraX8V-x0,theres actually a gel you can submerge electronics in that looks like water and you can make a pc aquarium
5ziraX8V-x0,do more videos regularly pleaseeeeeeee
5ziraX8V-x0,mr yeester is so great with austin
5ziraX8V-x0,that dex thing might come in handy for me
5ziraX8V-x0,invite linus to drop test everything
5ziraX8V-x0,this is the most terrifying horror video ive seen today
5ziraX8V-x0,mr yeester collab the best one yet
5ziraX8V-x0,flex seal looks like an as seen on tv version of plastidip
5ziraX8V-x0,after so long we got the best collab
5ziraX8V-x0,i cant wait for the portable series x
5ziraX8V-x0,on ios you need a lightning to hdmi adapter and a bluetooth mouse and keyboard
5ziraX8V-x0,how to make the best pc add flex seal
5ziraX8V-x0,i loved this video you need to do this again austin
5ziraX8V-x0,i love my dex setup i use it to steam link from my desktop
5ziraX8V-x0,thay make dust covers for all the ports on the mobo for next paint experiments
5ziraX8V-x0,best collab ever
5ziraX8V-x0,bring him to broke vs pro series
5ziraX8V-x0,i flex sealed my mother board white to do a custom snow blind build it doesnt hurt any thing
5ziraX8V-x0,ahh yes continue second hand spreading of tech misinformation austin
5ziraX8V-x0,the fact that he said okay charles barkley is so funny we were playing golf because of him being terrible at it
5ziraX8V-x0,when did this turn into tech cold ones
5ziraX8V-x0,send it to new egg so they can resale it
5ziraX8V-x0,theres a couple areas where the pins are just gnd vcc or not used all of which are fine to destroy as long as you arent creating a short

o0k4fCBo9mA,the level of creativity and immaculate building skills are just
o0k4fCBo9mA,im a build battle veteran and your three tips are right on the money you need to be creative not only to win but to also enjoy yourself while playing
o0k4fCBo9mA,it seems like very good practice for building
o0k4fCBo9mA,that trexso cute fun video it was neat to see your building skills increase 
o0k4fCBo9mA,luke getting progressively more salty and bitter at the other builds as the vid goes on is massively relatable
o0k4fCBo9mA,sometimes being creative is pointless wise words from a wise man
o0k4fCBo9mA,you can see him slowly descending into madness because of the other builds
o0k4fCBo9mA,luke has to remember that half of the judges are 11 year olds
o0k4fCBo9mA,this was extremely enjoyable to watch seeing your buildings and the way you react to other builds is great i say pleas make more of these
o0k4fCBo9mA,the pretty famished caterpillar deserves an oscar for how original and beautiful it is
o0k4fCBo9mA,every time luke uploads my day instantly brightens
o0k4fCBo9mA,luke is the perfect youtuber to watch while eating food lol
o0k4fCBo9mA,he puts so much effort into these videoshe started this in january and its june keep up the good work
o0k4fCBo9mA,i didnt want to watch this then it auto played and i loved it ever since great job luke thenotable you are notable
o0k4fCBo9mA,the three things ive learned in this video
o0k4fCBo9mA,it was sos awesome to see luke slowly improve on his building throughout the video also the pretty famished caterpiller made me laugh so hard
o0k4fCBo9mA,i want to thank all my years not being a vegan
o0k4fCBo9mA,out of all the spinoffs this ones def the best
o0k4fCBo9mA,first 100 days ive actually loved in a long time
o0k4fCBo9mA,really good content thank u for making my day
o0k4fCBo9mA,my pro tip is this
o0k4fCBo9mA,luke saw bacon and the first 2 words that popped into his head were pig and guillotine
o0k4fCBo9mA,lets take a moment to appreciate the perfect 30 minutes
o0k4fCBo9mA,other players when they get a food prompt builds the food
o0k4fCBo9mA,i got almost 100 wins back in the day when everyone automatically voted superpoop i feel your struggle this many wins is well deserved
o0k4fCBo9mA,wow thats a really good dice whoever made this is a master
o0k4fCBo9mA,every legendary that hes gotten so far looked 10x better than anything ive ever built
o0k4fCBo9mA,this whole video was just hilarious the way luke acts and some of the terrible builds done by other people make this video a masterpiece
o0k4fCBo9mA,what ive learnt from this video is even after 100 days of building some people just arent made for building youll get there one day luke
o0k4fCBo9mA,i hope that you enjoyed this video enough to earn your subscription
o0k4fCBo9mA,i respect everyone who were involved in this  seriously the best piece that i  ve ever seen on youtube hats of the well all  love your videos
o0k4fCBo9mA,my favorite part of this video is luke being passive aggressively nice to all the 10year olds builds hes competing with
o0k4fCBo9mA,if you are observant enough you can notice his saltiness levels rising with each game
o0k4fCBo9mA,alright looking forward to having 250 more players in build battles
o0k4fCBo9mA,thank you luke for this amazing video this really inspires me to play build battle again
o0k4fCBo9mA,love it keep up the good content excited for 3000 days in hardcore
o0k4fCBo9mA,ive got some memories on this fun but often frustrating game mode
o0k4fCBo9mA,i want to thank all my years not being a vegan my favorite quote yet
o0k4fCBo9mA,thank you for making this video that i know is going to be perfect
o0k4fCBo9mA,todays fact you breathe on average about 5 million times a year
o0k4fCBo9mA,i like how hes already telling us how to play it on game 2  still on of my fav ytbrs
o0k4fCBo9mA,i might try this  it seems like very good practice for building
o0k4fCBo9mA,as a former pro build battle player this video summoned me and i agree with your tips i would say that just having fun is the key to getting good
o0k4fCBo9mA,great video really enjoy watching the builds improve as you get better at it
o0k4fCBo9mA,great vid another video idea is a 100 days with the warden deep dark keep up the good work
o0k4fCBo9mA,can we just appreciate the fact that all of these 100 days videos are exactly 30 minutes
o0k4fCBo9mA,luke slowly going insane wal getting batter at building things people will actually vote for
o0k4fCBo9mA,when youve finished your emerald tower you should put a golden crown on top in honor of technoblade
o0k4fCBo9mA,i was waiting for something like this love it luke
o0k4fCBo9mA,the ice one wasnt part of the build it is a win effect its called cold snap
o0k4fCBo9mA,i really love the creativity and for someone who is a master at build battle i think you did pretty dang good
o0k4fCBo9mA,so a lesson that i have learned from this pixel art is on par with 3d art
o0k4fCBo9mA,for the record i could easily tell that it was a pig in a rocket ship 1010 build
o0k4fCBo9mA,i love all your builds some of them were funny dude lol my favorite creation is the cloud one you created goku on the nimbus
o0k4fCBo9mA,this seems easier to do than anything else done 100 times so i hope it gets continuations soon
o0k4fCBo9mA,a ltn video on a saturday afternoon is just amazing
o0k4fCBo9mA,this was epic please make this a series
o0k4fCBo9mA,love the amazing content keep it up 
o0k4fCBo9mA,all of the builds looks great
o0k4fCBo9mA,luke with deep sadness i say this
o0k4fCBo9mA,the fact some of the builds luke made didnt get first place shows how incredibly flawed society is
o0k4fCBo9mA,imagine not letting luke win in the build battle because you thought he was a fake one
o0k4fCBo9mA,you can see him slowly decenting into madness because of the other builds
o0k4fCBo9mA,hey luke you should definitely play project zomboid i would love to watch you survive 100 days in pz
o0k4fCBo9mA,he puts so much effort into these videoshe started this in january and its june keep up the good work edit tysm for the likes
o0k4fCBo9mA,bro has mastered every corner of survival minecraft he now must conquer his harshest task yet competitive building no wait dont leave its serious i promi
o0k4fCBo9mA,finally more people are playing build battle thanks to this video went from a few hundred to a few thousand
o0k4fCBo9mA,there were a lot of cute build in this and some i couldnt help but laugh at very nice please do more lol
o0k4fCBo9mA,4 months for this masterpiece yea worth of wait
o0k4fCBo9mA,really enjoyed this you encouraged me to do this myself
o0k4fCBo9mA,to be honest these videos are really interesting and entertaining
o0k4fCBo9mA,damni love build battles they just show few of the core mechanics of minecraftbuilding and creativity

j3ukWDGrqpg,actually one of the best hockey games ive seen in a while
j3ukWDGrqpg,its getting closer colorado i really hope you guys can do it next game in front of your own fans
j3ukWDGrqpg,in the overtime period colorado was clearly dominant even improved vasilevskiy could not prevent colorado victory without taking anything from tampa colorado is a better deeper team
j3ukWDGrqpg,yep go avalanche thank you to the bolts for making it interesting
j3ukWDGrqpg,bringing it home lets go boys the amount of fire works from my neighbors say it all
j3ukWDGrqpg,luck was on avalanches side hardness and courage allowed them to beat lighthing congratulations of all avalanche fans

j3ukWDGrqpg,pivotal moment for kadri and the avs i have no doubt they win in 5 or 6 now
j3ukWDGrqpg,yes i want colorado to win this cup
j3ukWDGrqpg,superb game from avalanche vasilevski and a bit of luck were the reason colorado didnt win 62
j3ukWDGrqpg,whew what concentrated and focused puck handling by kadri to get the set up shot
j3ukWDGrqpg,if the avs win the cup im literally going to cry tears of joy this is the first time i get to witness a cup run
j3ukWDGrqpg,no matter how good a team may be to win a championship you need great goaltending

j3ukWDGrqpg,     lets go colorado you are winner
j3ukWDGrqpg,sick shot through vasi avs have a chance to win the cup at home but the bolts will not go quietly cant wait until friday
j3ukWDGrqpg,i said it before the finals and ill say it again bolts are getting burried under an avalanche awesome
j3ukWDGrqpg,i am cheering for tampa bay
j3ukWDGrqpg,kadri was my hero in torontonow same thing in this game wtg man so happy for you
j3ukWDGrqpg,its tough for the lightning to get through the east they look tired go avs
j3ukWDGrqpg,the lightning played their game and still lost thats shocking colorado is another beast this year after seeing 4 games i dont think anyone stood a chance tbh
j3ukWDGrqpg,awesome comeback on sog lets go avs just on more and its lights out tampa
j3ukWDGrqpg,cant wait to see steves reaction on this
j3ukWDGrqpg,what a tremendous game battle of the goalies lets go ass
j3ukWDGrqpg,colorado wayyyy too good right now
j3ukWDGrqpg,colorados coach and the avs didnt complain when kuemper got his hat knocked off and the bolts scored
j3ukWDGrqpg,been watching hockey since 1991 and thats the secondmost awkward ot goal ive seen
j3ukWDGrqpg,its hilarious that us broadcasters had no idea where the puck was after the kadri goal but the sportsnet commentators did finish it off avs
j3ukWDGrqpg,that was vintage arizona kuemper tonight nice to meet you tampa

wt6SwI84iQs,big thank you to the producers for letting this run  do not micro manage if you want real  so refreshing  way to stay cool dudes
wt6SwI84iQs,brianna private schools still take standardised govt tests and have math and reading benchmarks to make youre speaking from ignorance right now
wt6SwI84iQs,i support this we pay property taxes that go to education we should be able to direct our share for our kids education
wt6SwI84iQs,she really has a hard time with opinions other than her own
wt6SwI84iQs,i like how bri is holding back with a sideward smile and an inner scream robbie is so matter a fact but is also staying cool under fire
wt6SwI84iQs,this was great thats why i love these guys i love listening to both sides and seeing productive discussions
wt6SwI84iQs,i like robbie more and more hes turning me into a libertarian dont snap robbie hang in there brother 
wt6SwI84iQs,brianna doesnt understand what accreditation means am i hearing that correctly
wt6SwI84iQs,robby is spot on great job standing your ground
wt6SwI84iQs,bjg got owned making up lies about what conservatives think had me cracking up like bjg knows howwhat conservatives think
wt6SwI84iQs,bri is so afraid of anyone having the least bit of control of their lives
wt6SwI84iQs,robbie they have to meet the accreditation standards to be a school you cant send your kids to a school that doesnt meet accreditation standards period
wt6SwI84iQs,debates are great arguing with an emotional attachment is not necessarily informative
wt6SwI84iQs,this was an absolute master class on patience by robby i dont know how you do it man
wt6SwI84iQs,bri really loves the sound of her own voice
wt6SwI84iQs,bri keeps creating strawman arguements  and is disappointed when robby is ok with her ridiculous scenarios
wt6SwI84iQs,robby was so relaxed during the whole radar brie proved him right over and over
wt6SwI84iQs,so this entire segment was just briahna making pointless arguments because she doesnt know what accreditation standards mean and even admits it at
wt6SwI84iQs,robbie walked all over bri on this one
wt6SwI84iQs,briana so youre saying that
wt6SwI84iQs,i agree with robby bri is right when she said she doesnt know what that means shes making a ignorant argument my tax dollars my choice
wt6SwI84iQs,shes having a hard time accepting ok  as an answer
wt6SwI84iQs,wow briahna could not get out of her own head on this one
wt6SwI84iQs,bri doesnt know what accreditation standards are what girl bye
wt6SwI84iQs,your terms are acceptable
wt6SwI84iQs,robby i agree with you
wt6SwI84iQs,if this was football id say time of possession for bri was
wt6SwI84iQs,brianha is trying so hard to find a scenario where robby says this is unacceptable and hes like you do you buddy
wt6SwI84iQs,bri  just wasnt ready for this discussion
wt6SwI84iQs,i would have loved to see what happened as soon as the cameras shut off
wt6SwI84iQs,robbie lets live  let live school choice is good for families
wt6SwI84iQs,for someone who went to harvard law school it is amazing how extremely bad briana is at debating
wt6SwI84iQs,if its secular education standards is an issue then add all your requirements in the accreditation process for all schools
wt6SwI84iQs,bri people should not be able to choose what school they want their kids to go to with their own tax money
wt6SwI84iQs,this may have been the most informative and respectful dialogue ive ever seen on this issue well done
wt6SwI84iQs,bri talking about what the founding fathers intended while also wanting to ban citizens from owning the most popular rifle in america
wt6SwI84iQs,your terms are acceptable
wt6SwI84iQs,read the first amendment and this ruling makes sense
wt6SwI84iQs,robby trounced bri again her bad faith on this topic is so irritating the state isnt establishing one religion over the other but thats what bri seems to believe
wt6SwI84iQs,bri building strawman upon strawman because she cant handle robbies answer
wt6SwI84iQs,i love this healthy debating bravo the hill great job robby and briahna
wt6SwI84iQs,bri gets mad over not changing robs mind
wt6SwI84iQs,thanks to all of the rising gang
wt6SwI84iQs,idk what that means bri
wt6SwI84iQs,i liked ravis no at
wt6SwI84iQs,you can go to christian colleges with government money the army has chaplains it has imams
wt6SwI84iQs,a wonderful thing about this ruling that they failed to mention is that school choice promotes competition in schools
wt6SwI84iQs,i dont know what that means
wt6SwI84iQs,separation of church  state is clearly understood and emphasized by briana thank you
wt6SwI84iQs,i agree with robbie on this for sure i wish ryan was back on
wt6SwI84iQs,good one nice to see some back and forth instead of everyone forced to be on the same page of thought
wt6SwI84iQs,seeing briahna this upset i knew shed throw the race card in at some point
wt6SwI84iQs,states are independant and are not subject to funding limitations on the federal level
wt6SwI84iQs,love how sotomayer calls religious education as indoctrinationwow
wt6SwI84iQs,i dont know what that is  bj gray then why are you debating
wt6SwI84iQs,i dont know what that means in regards to accreditation then maybe you shouldnt go on a giant rant about something that you are so illinformed of
wt6SwI84iQs,simply solution end the dept of education and all taxes associated with it
wt6SwI84iQs,great conversation keep it up
wt6SwI84iQs,finally  the rising goes full steel cage match i like these two
wt6SwI84iQs,robby always teaches a mater class in keeping cool
wt6SwI84iQs,i paid from my own packet for a catholic school glad i did that and i still had to pay taxes for public school it was expansive but worth it
wt6SwI84iQs,shes really invoking the founding fathers today strange
wt6SwI84iQs,what is required as part of the education in order to meet secular education requirements that seems to be a critical question in all of this doesnt it
wt6SwI84iQs,love the debate would love more great respectful debates are hard to find
wt6SwI84iQs,great debate keep it up
RGFepU7VXcY,ageshaming is pretty outdated tooany kind of shaming to be fair
RGFepU7VXcY,ageism old and  ugly are not synonymous the fashion tips are spot onhowever the word old was used as an insultnot cool im 68 and so very proud
RGFepU7VXcY,shea your commentary is always refreshing and even if i dont agree with everything you say you always give me ideas and food for thought in a friendly casual way
RGFepU7VXcY,if you look good in itwear itnow a days its not about what is in or outeveryone should just have their own style
RGFepU7VXcY,i think what we actually need are tips and tricks for not caring how old we look and for not caring how old we are
RGFepU7VXcY,liked this video  im 67  have been making the better fashion choices by instinct for years now
RGFepU7VXcY,the fact that you know youre offending people and dont care youre making yourself unlikeable
RGFepU7VXcY,fun video  dont be afraid to age though  its a gift  i love my gray hair and my cardigans
RGFepU7VXcY,after watching fashions change over the last 40 years im not outdated im leading the trend by 5 years or so
RGFepU7VXcY,i think this whole outlook is ridiculous growing older is a gift  wear whatever makes you happy embrace your individuality live your very best life
RGFepU7VXcY,i think a better title wouldve been 10 fashion mistakes that make you look outdated and dwelled less on looking youthful or younger
RGFepU7VXcY,i agree with some of what you said however mary janes are classic shoes that never go out of style for old or young  they arent just for little girls
RGFepU7VXcY,the goal for me is not to look younger and certainly not trendy  but appropriate stylish  comfortable in my clothes
RGFepU7VXcY,i dont follow fashion trends or home decorating trends  our house is decorated the way my husband and i like it its cozy and comfortable
RGFepU7VXcY,i enjoy fashion tips at age 71 and as others have said outdated and older are not the same
RGFepU7VXcY,i disagree about brunettes going lighter as they age not all brunettes look good with blonde hair ive seen brunettes go blonde and look much older than they really are
RGFepU7VXcY,i agree with all of this except the hair barrettes i love fancy hair barrettes and will keep wearing them
RGFepU7VXcY,why i enjoy watching sheas videos  not only are they informative on many topics but quick thx shea for always getting straight to the point 
RGFepU7VXcY,this is my favourite video of yours
RGFepU7VXcY,taking notes
RGFepU7VXcY,the scariest part of getting older is the fear of ugly shoes
RGFepU7VXcY,who decided what looks young destroy the rules dont propel them
RGFepU7VXcY,im 64 and i work out 5 times a week and lift weights  i totally agree with her tips i love fashion and work hard to take care of myself
RGFepU7VXcY,ive literally never seen a child wear a cardigan
RGFepU7VXcY,one thing i can agree with thank god most of us do not follow fashion trends because it would be a boring world we would all look alike
RGFepU7VXcY,thank you for being willing to risk offense shea i appreciate the tips
RGFepU7VXcY,from someone that is older 62 i have some recommendations for you to consider oh and i did enjoy your video
RGFepU7VXcY,i think its all in your attitude anyone can rock something dope if they own it
RGFepU7VXcY,i like all the pointssuggestions you said
RGFepU7VXcY,i so agree with the capri pants thing given them up this year never felt happier
RGFepU7VXcY,i think that big floral patterns make the dress look more expensive and that the matching jewelry give a classy touch to the outfit
RGFepU7VXcY,absolutely loved the start very fun and humorous always enjoy watching excellent advice and suggestions love from australia
-AnLVFt7mvA,do you agree with my thoughts on apple using 3nm tech for m2 promax comment below
-AnLVFt7mvA,3nm means longer battery life due to small size processor and small wattage usage this is amazing move from apple
-AnLVFt7mvA,this is so awesomereally appreciate your efforts in creating these informative videosi love how detailed yet simple you make all your videosthey are very entertaining and amazingkeep it up
-AnLVFt7mvA,tomorrow why you shouldnt buy the m2 macbooks
-AnLVFt7mvA,how it feels to watch you channel 
-AnLVFt7mvA,yep this makes perfect sense typically newexpensive technology is used first in the premiumhigh end products with the trickle down over time of those technologies to the lower end products
-AnLVFt7mvA,im rocking the m1 air 16gb im still blown away by the performance im a developer and it meets all my needs for app development
-AnLVFt7mvA,i do think m2 pro and mac are still gonna be based on 5nm due to silicon shortage
-AnLVFt7mvA,scaling down is what intel does and they are famous for their inefficient lower end chips apples whole thing is performance
-AnLVFt7mvA,big question im due for an upgrade should i wait for the m2 16in macbook pro or just go ahead and purchase the current m1 max 21 
-AnLVFt7mvA,when the m2 m3 base chips starts to catching up with the m1 pros i would consider upgrading from my m1 pro 16 macbook
-AnLVFt7mvA,im so obsessed by the new macbook air im impatiently waiting to put my hands on it
-AnLVFt7mvA,this is what i like best about this channel always staying ahead of the curve when it comes to speculating and seeing what apple does next
-AnLVFt7mvA,this was remarkable analysis i wanna write that i agree with you 100 i cannot wait for the battle between m1 pro vs m2 in macbooks
-AnLVFt7mvA,i think the mbp 14 and 16 will have m3 pro and m3 max chips
-AnLVFt7mvA,great videos and very informative    keep up the good work
-AnLVFt7mvA,my first apple silicon will be 3nm i can wait till next year hopefully the gaming situation improves by then
-AnLVFt7mvA,i am excited for the m2 pro because i am saving up for a base 14 inch and it will be even better if i wait a little longer
-AnLVFt7mvA,i think it should be called m3 pro and at least a year to wait
-AnLVFt7mvA,this only make sense for a m2 mac mini if the mac studios work also be upgraded to m2 variants
-AnLVFt7mvA,i doubt we will get to see the n3 on the m2 lineup
-AnLVFt7mvA,the 3nm should be the m3 hope to get m1pro performance at an entry level price of 1199 with the m3
-AnLVFt7mvA,m2 promax will not be 3nm m3 will be 3nm
-AnLVFt7mvA,i wish the pro one could be cheaper so that i could start coding again and it also handles gaming thats a plus
-AnLVFt7mvA,yes please time to start saving money now i wonder how much more they will cost
-AnLVFt7mvA,no point unless the macbook has a future in gaming which may be years away otherwise the m1 range is more than enough at this stage
-AnLVFt7mvA,i would sell my car to get an m2 3nm with hardware ray tracing
-AnLVFt7mvA,currently using the 14 base macbook pro i will probably upgrade when m3 is released this current mac that i have last 9 to 11 hrs on a single charge
-AnLVFt7mvA,i hope this will come true as im saving up for a 16
-AnLVFt7mvA,high cost low volumesounds like a good fit for the mac pro to me
-AnLVFt7mvA,that is just so exciting finally something that justify for me to spend twice the money
-AnLVFt7mvA,how small can this stuff go though 3nm is nuts im wondering how electricity even can pass through those channels
-AnLVFt7mvA,i think m2 promax has to hold until next m3 release its too fast and intel cant catch up
-AnLVFt7mvA,bro request you to start providing timestamps in all your future upcoming videos we can directly go the topic we interested in 
-AnLVFt7mvA,im watching this on my m1 pro mbp 16 shaking my head because the m2 promax would be overkill for me
-AnLVFt7mvA,please do an m2 mba 10core gpu 16gb ram 512gb ssd vs  m1 pro mbp 16core gpu 16gb ram 512gb1tb ssd thanks
-AnLVFt7mvA,im waiting for m2 pro to upgrade my m1 macbook air i need big performance improvements and fans and a new design
-AnLVFt7mvA,m1 pro and max should be way more enough for most users unless they shrink the notch at least 30
-AnLVFt7mvA,the 2021 macs pro still new i dont think we will see m2 pro or max in two years time
-AnLVFt7mvA,m2 max is gonna cost the same as a new car deposit
-AnLVFt7mvA,i love your videos do you plan on adding m1 pro merch i would really like to purchase a tshirt and hoodie with this design
-AnLVFt7mvA,anyone notice the error message at blender for apple versions of alpha blender  i think this is critical as an indication of apples gaming future
-AnLVFt7mvA,m1 is still way too powerful for what i use i wont upgrade for a few years
-AnLVFt7mvA,hope you will receive the macbook earlier i saw some youtubers got their new devices yesterday
-AnLVFt7mvA,do you think the smaller node will allow them to make a lighter macbook pro
-AnLVFt7mvA,so should i cancel my m1 max order which so far is sight unseen maybe just wait for the new macbook pro m2max
-AnLVFt7mvA,my god is it so hard to make a 16 inch macbook air just do it and it will be the best laptop in the world
-AnLVFt7mvA,i have a lot of the same thoughts as you but i wont get my hopes up just yet and ill just assume itll be based on 5nm or 4nm
-AnLVFt7mvA,max tech should sell tshirts saying i fully believe
-AnLVFt7mvA,im still waiting for armv9 for the m series chip
-AnLVFt7mvA,i previously disagreed but now youve convinced me
-AnLVFt7mvA,if they move to 3nm they would call it m3  none of their a series chips have been built on different nodes
-AnLVFt7mvA,wow coolest chart is at
-AnLVFt7mvA,cue the i was wrong video in a few months
-AnLVFt7mvA,they could just release m3 at wwdc next year based off a16
-AnLVFt7mvA,sounds good to me m2 pro and metal 3 is going to be bonkers
-AnLVFt7mvA,max i think a16 will 3nm and the m2 pro and max chip will be based on that
-AnLVFt7mvA,do you think the 3nm m2 max chip will have a 32mb tlb bottleneck like the m1 max chip
-AnLVFt7mvA,i havent even watched it yet and i agree  seems logical 
qzUCPoLWbu8,very interesting design looks a lot lower and more sporty im loving the rear taillights
qzUCPoLWbu8,thanks for another awesome review i appreciated the specs at the end curious what this and the 450h will tow thanks
qzUCPoLWbu8,just when you think the grill cant get any worse  power train and tech updates are interesting but styling is a hard pass for me
qzUCPoLWbu8,the grille is controversial but i think it makes it look so much more modern than the previous gen
qzUCPoLWbu8,proportions are much sportier than current   the grille design should extend to the horizontal plane going near the hood edge  love a bigger grille
qzUCPoLWbu8,not totally sold on the grill hopefully it will grow on me in time otherwise looks like lexus is taking genesis serious and upping their game
qzUCPoLWbu8,big grilles are a sign of prestige that why almost every luxury car has a gaping grille i like it
qzUCPoLWbu8,id like to see this go head to head with the 2022 acura mdx type s  it would be a good match
qzUCPoLWbu8,finally a update from lexus ive waited for this
qzUCPoLWbu8,2023 lexus rx 500h fsport looks great  evolutionary in design  interior looks well appointed  comfortable  slainte   cheers 
qzUCPoLWbu8,best review with the amount of time you hadthanks guys
qzUCPoLWbu8,i was looking at this car last night and man its already making last gen rx and other lexus look dated and the older lexus were still quite good looking
qzUCPoLWbu8,amazing car with spectacular rear its really hot
qzUCPoLWbu8,that front end the grill in particular looks like something a mom with fancy scissors drew up
qzUCPoLWbu8,i love the 2023 lexus rx 500h its very nice and i love the red interior
qzUCPoLWbu8,i cant believe i find a lexus rx desirable now well except for the 4cyinder only engine choices  the design is a revelation for a lexus
qzUCPoLWbu8,omg this looks great the only things i dont like atm are that beluga bulge above front l logo and no air vents in the b pillars
qzUCPoLWbu8,current honda accord front grille from top to bottom
qzUCPoLWbu8,why lexus put a 7 tachometer digital display but the highlander 2023  tundra and sequoia have the complete 124 digital tachometer
qzUCPoLWbu8,bro you forgot to do the coupons test to see if they fit anywhere in the car
qzUCPoLWbu8,amazing video
qzUCPoLWbu8,beautiful car
qzUCPoLWbu8,try terry blacks bbq while yall are here in dallas youre welcome
qzUCPoLWbu8,those massive brakes looks overkill to me
qzUCPoLWbu8,it doesnt look very spacious compared to a q7 or volvo xc90
qzUCPoLWbu8,gonna be 100k cad its getting out of control now
qzUCPoLWbu8,i like 2022 v6 looks better i think
qzUCPoLWbu8,maybe its me but it looks like a cross between the venza and the highlander
qzUCPoLWbu8,did they bring back the rioja red interior for the fsport
qzUCPoLWbu8,the cleaning guy was probably like ahhh please dont leave your fingerprints on the headlight
qzUCPoLWbu8,the inside looks like a copypaste from the nx
qzUCPoLWbu8,is there a purpose behind the push button door latchlike in the nx
qzUCPoLWbu8,did i just see toyota jeff dancing in the background
qzUCPoLWbu8,why not 123 inch mid 
qzUCPoLWbu8,a kid boarded my school bus with that exact  donut in your opening selfpromo with homer simpson holding it
qzUCPoLWbu8,the placement of the logo makes the front look like a toyota
qzUCPoLWbu8,did they hire accords exterior designer or what
qzUCPoLWbu8,grill looks so much better
qzUCPoLWbu8,personally i dont care for the black wheels looks to much black
qzUCPoLWbu8,the side still look the same
qzUCPoLWbu8,is it a great white
qzUCPoLWbu8,great video but damn other reporters are just rude
qzUCPoLWbu8,hydrocephalus looking car
qzUCPoLWbu8,nice under armour t shirt i prefer mine with no collars
qzUCPoLWbu8,the front is incredibly ugly really lexus thats the best you can do
qzUCPoLWbu8,how much i want it
qzUCPoLWbu8,decent design that grill with the swollen upper lip looks like the day after getting punched by mike tyson
qzUCPoLWbu8,oh nooooooo
qzUCPoLWbu8,i think its ugly glad now that a bought the nx
qzUCPoLWbu8,that laugh
qzUCPoLWbu8,this really looks like a urus
qzUCPoLWbu8,more plastic piano black doesnt it sound like germans i think that new models of every brand maybe except mazda and genesis have poorer quality in comparison to previous generations
O0gbfvJDsv4,so its only 3 slower than a 12900ks uses half the power fits in a 5 year old motherboard
O0gbfvJDsv4,faster in games where it matters for 40 less power and is 45 cheaper seems like a banger
O0gbfvJDsv4,if you look at other gn benchmarks youll see that on average its faster than the 12900ks  it really just depends on what you benchmark
O0gbfvJDsv4,cant wait for am5 and zen 4 excited to see how it performs compared to this
O0gbfvJDsv4,im confused by the i7 12700k being way out ahead and showing its 2 faster is that not within the margin of error or does the graph have an error
O0gbfvJDsv4,note that the 5800x3d is a ryzen
O0gbfvJDsv4,cant wait for the monster ryzen 9x in any case just goes to show vigorous competition quickly spurs rapid innovations which ultimately benefits everyone
O0gbfvJDsv4,as a consumer im very glad to see competition between amd and intel as amd fanboy im always happy to see amd beating or keeping up with intel
O0gbfvJDsv4,keep in mind that you dont need an expensive new board or ddr5 memory to utilize its full potential amd for the win here
O0gbfvJDsv4,it may looked like that the 12700k is cheaper but once you factor in the motherboard cost the ryzen still has lower platform cost
O0gbfvJDsv4,ill probably go for this once the next generation of amd cpus are out
O0gbfvJDsv4,we can argue on this issue
O0gbfvJDsv4,nice to see the cpu wars is back where its supposed to be trading blows back and forth equally
O0gbfvJDsv4,i feel this is more effective at selling you the 5800x and not the 3d the fact 5800x keeps up at the price point is awesome
O0gbfvJDsv4,im impressed by the performance and efficiency gains
O0gbfvJDsv4,as a c programmer i can only say that its incredibly hard to overstate how important cache memory is
O0gbfvJDsv4,linus is slowly going from the guy who reviews the tech to the guy who appears every video to advertise the sponsor
O0gbfvJDsv4,this cpu is like the best season final of the ryzen am4 show now customers exited to see the am5 season
O0gbfvJDsv4,its still rather impressive that this is not only still on am4 but the fact that it is so damn power efficient as well vs intels top performers
O0gbfvJDsv4,i hope they improve the heat dissipation between the 3d cache and processor
O0gbfvJDsv4,is it a safe bet that games going forward will utilize the 3d cache more frequently especially since amd is already in xbox and ps systems
O0gbfvJDsv4,proud to have this cpu  as owner yes my experience is this a good to have cpua little hot tempbut still good performance it can give you
O0gbfvJDsv4,its just insane to see how much more the intel core consume power
O0gbfvJDsv4,ah amd im glad youre back to putting out fiscally reasonable high performance chips
O0gbfvJDsv4,its amazing now much faster intel is making their cpus year over year now that theres competition
O0gbfvJDsv4,i712700k is looking good to me gaming performance is still great but also productivity performance is great but price is more reasonable than 12900k
O0gbfvJDsv4,upgrading the second time without changing the motherboard that is so underrated love it
O0gbfvJDsv4,great summary of where this chips sits
O0gbfvJDsv4,as a ryzen 5800x owner i am a bit jealous good job amd  cant wait to see what they will do with am5
O0gbfvJDsv4,i love the fact that amd decided to release the 5800x3d just to show off their new technology that most likely will be integrated into their next gen
O0gbfvJDsv4,imagine a two socket motherboard with one  5800x3d and one 12900ks the best of both worlds that would be insane
O0gbfvJDsv4,12900ks the cpu that beats all for 2 minutes then it drops down from heat and power use and is roughly the same as a 5800x with pbo turned off
O0gbfvJDsv4,my 1st gen asus x370f motherboard that i got on ryzens launch in 2017 just got a firmware update to support this cpu  not bad for a 5yr old platform
O0gbfvJDsv4,this video makes me feel pretty darn good about my 12700k purchase
O0gbfvJDsv4,my first experience with amd was in 2002 ive owned an amd duron 1000mhz it was fast damn
O0gbfvJDsv4,excellent priceperformance by amd
O0gbfvJDsv4,grats on amd for their success on their am4 platform
O0gbfvJDsv4,just a few seconds into the video i am already impressed just by the difference in performance between a standard 5800x and the new 3d version
O0gbfvJDsv4,it seems like a bit of an experiment by amd i look foward to seeing what they do with this technology in the future
O0gbfvJDsv4,basically cache is the fastest memory outside of the registers on a cpu if youre interested look up cache hits and cache misses
O0gbfvJDsv4,very impressive amd cant wait to see the new chips
O0gbfvJDsv4,im a proud ryzen 7 5800x owner and this cpu is amazing and slept on she runs a little hot but a 240 aio controls the temps comfortably
O0gbfvJDsv4,should have tested the x3d in bethesda games fallout 4 and skyrim are still seeing play and are very cachecpu limited
O0gbfvJDsv4,im so glad they talked anthony to going on camera more he knows his stuff and i agree with a previous comment that his skills are improving
O0gbfvJDsv4,i wonder how this compares to the 5900x isnt that technically faster
O0gbfvJDsv4,sometimes i just watch these videos just to see how they do their merch drops i was not disappointed awesome as always
O0gbfvJDsv4,this videos tests seem a bit odd after just watching gamer nexus video where their tests were leaning a bit more towards the 3d
O0gbfvJDsv4,this is great great for an upgrade path for my system in a few years if i need more corescache
O0gbfvJDsv4,cant wait to see how the 3d line of cpus stacks up in the long run against the am5 platform and possibly 13th gen intel
O0gbfvJDsv4,intel sometimes matches the 5800x3d in games at almost double the price at about 250 watts to the 5800x3d 100 watts
O0gbfvJDsv4,and the amd chip is doing this with slower clock speeds if so damn impressive

DsBIA61xtaI,shame on mike pence for not testifying and making us have to hear these things from a young woman with more guts than him
DsBIA61xtaI,they wouldnt risk having her testify if they didnt have corroboration without a doubt
DsBIA61xtaI,hope this brave young lady who put our country first stays safe
DsBIA61xtaI,despise party or beliefs she is a true patriot who put all those decades older than her in shame
DsBIA61xtaI,this lady is telling the truth the department of justice will do the rest
DsBIA61xtaI,shes a rock star a true patriot and hero
DsBIA61xtaI,let us hope and pray that law enforcement step up and protect the witnesses and immediately deal with the thugs trying to silence them
DsBIA61xtaI,i was disgusted as an american  cassidy hutchinson
DsBIA61xtaI,trumps theyre not here to hurt me says it all
DsBIA61xtaI,let her be an example for all of those who are struggling to find the courage to testify
DsBIA61xtaI,this young woman is taking the questions and pence is still hiding under his desk

DsBIA61xtaI,i believe every thing she said my god bless her and protect her
DsBIA61xtaI,that would be almost impossible come on give us a break again he is lying say it loud and clear cassidy hutchison had wayyy more courage than you
DsBIA61xtaI,this young lady has more courage than the entire grand old party men 3 times her age
DsBIA61xtaI,she just embarrassed a lot of powerful and wellconnected men that have a lot of rabid followers pray for her safety
DsBIA61xtaI,trump lying about all this right away  no surprise there  lying is what he does best  she sat practically right outside the oval office yet trump cant recall her  lol
DsBIA61xtaI,may god protect all these brave men and women that came forward
DsBIA61xtaI,every single time he wants to distance himself from the truth he pulls the i dont know her cardlololol hes such a predictable liar lololol
DsBIA61xtaI,i applaud her courage
DsBIA61xtaI,bastards let the young woman tell her storywhat cowards

DsBIA61xtaI,cassidy is awesome the real patriot shes simply inspirational
DsBIA61xtaI,what a brave young  woman
DsBIA61xtaI,the fact that trump can run again sad ass country
DsBIA61xtaI,now can someone get pence to explain why he didnt invoke the 25th
DsBIA61xtaI,hutchisons testimony was courageous to the point of heroism brings tears to my old eyes loyal honest americans still exist in the face of fearful threats
DsBIA61xtaI,i want to see ginny thomas dragged into the hearing to see what she got to say
DsBIA61xtaI,this young lady showed courage and patriotism today
DsBIA61xtaI,her testimony was powerful cant be denied
DsBIA61xtaI,on another levelthis was the best one yet i cant wait for more
DsBIA61xtaI,i pray that this strong young woman and her family has peace and serenity away from harassment and evil hopefully she has security protection
DsBIA61xtaI,excellent coverage and appropriate gravity of the situation conveyed stay with the facts
DsBIA61xtaI,25 years old and is a better american  and has more experience being honest than trump mcconnell and mccarthy
DsBIA61xtaI,she is so impressivewhat a great human being
DsBIA61xtaI,her parents should be proud they raised a decent person she wasnt going to sell her soul to trump
DsBIA61xtaI,the courage this lady showed today wow
DsBIA61xtaI,cassidys life is forever changed i hope she has around the clock security she will need it for the rest of her life shes a hero
DsBIA61xtaI,the doj should be getting a warrant for trumps arrest today i hope they do something
DsBIA61xtaI,what a wonderful woman you are miss hutchinson courageous true patriot and defender of our constitution and democracy
DsBIA61xtaI,she was a young female so he knew who she was   period
DsBIA61xtaI,courage honesty this is how real republicans act
DsBIA61xtaI,all the other hearings were legally damning ms hutchisons courage went way beyond legally damning
DsBIA61xtaI,this is all so astounding to me this young lady is a gift to all americans she is to be lifted up and protected for her honest candor
DsBIA61xtaI,protect this amazing brave patriot thank you cassidy hutchinson
DsBIA61xtaI,insane i dont know how can anybody vote for trump
DsBIA61xtaI,what a brave young lady  her ex colleagues need to grow some and tell the truth
DsBIA61xtaI,hats off to cassidymay god bless and protect her
DsBIA61xtaI,mulvaney might not have been there at those stages but hes as guilty as anyone for having encouraged the lies and deceit that evolved into those final moments
DsBIA61xtaI,shes the quintessential patriot a true ryder with much more integrity than any male politician on the hill  run for president young lady you got my vote
DsBIA61xtaI,brave woman you know trump will berate her and call her a traitor and a coward he will attack her for telling the truth
DsBIA61xtaI,thank you for speaking up cassidy thank you for your courage and honesty
DsBIA61xtaI,what a brave young woman btw wasnt  mo brooks the one wearing a protective vest so he also knew there were armed people in the mob
DsBIA61xtaI,people this is what bravery looks like this is who and what our young people should view as a role model

DsBIA61xtaI,hr whole appearance  looks personify that of an honest truthfull patriot of the american dream thank you cassidy go well
DsBIA61xtaI,she found out her boss is a monster shes brave af shes got brass balls
DsBIA61xtaI,she also said she was done disgusted because it was based on a lieshe knew then that it was all a lie
DsBIA61xtaI,my guess is the jury in trumps criminal trial will find ms hutchison a highly credible and compelling witness
DsBIA61xtaI,mike pence should be interviewed what a spineless coward

kO5FURUKTi4,its proof that marketing can make people do anything
kO5FURUKTi4,i used to remember 10 years ago people were being clowned for wearing crocs oh how the times have changed
kO5FURUKTi4,i think
kO5FURUKTi4,crocs are very slippery in the wet thats why i avoid wearing them in the monsoon otherwise they are excellent in every matter they should come with a grippy sole
kO5FURUKTi4,wish you had touched on their efforts to recycle their shoes what do they do with them is it real
kO5FURUKTi4,admit it crocs has become a new fashion category like a trench coat and they are only shoes which are customizable this is huge
kO5FURUKTi4,i wear crocs everyday i started for work and then they became a everyday footwear i have over hundred plus crocs and counting
kO5FURUKTi4,i cannot believe they discontinued the freesail strapless clog best croc ever for women i loathe the bulky ones with straps
kO5FURUKTi4,the fact that it moulds into the shape of ones feet is the best thing
kO5FURUKTi4,i resisted these forever but gave in during the pandemic like much of the world best decision ever
kO5FURUKTi4,super expensive in india one can buy more than 10 pairs of local brand footwear in the same cost of a croc
kO5FURUKTi4,i just bought a pair today crocs rock
kO5FURUKTi4,i wore crocs when i was younger and i remember i would be so embarrassed lol
kO5FURUKTi4,not for sweaty fees though that friction with plastic will hurt
kO5FURUKTi4,they are comftable i use them all the time before bec they are really heaven on the feet
kO5FURUKTi4,i wear them when gardening
kO5FURUKTi4,why are they not making wedge huarache mini any morethose are their most comfortable sandals with heels
kO5FURUKTi4,the material and production method has great potential perhaps  why make them all so horribly ugly
kO5FURUKTi4,wait crocs are comfortwear i always heard plastic shoe sounds incredibly
kO5FURUKTi4,from that time jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand matthew 417
kO5FURUKTi4,now this video makes me want to try or buy a crocs
kO5FURUKTi4,ugha fashion statement for some but not all
kO5FURUKTi4,distortion in the economy is unprecedented
kO5FURUKTi4,in india every where crocs

kO5FURUKTi4,to each his own  never been a fan
kO5FURUKTi4,stock price went up bc of stimulus and qe not bc of work from home lol
kO5FURUKTi4,me these shoes are hideous i dont care what anyone says i would never
kO5FURUKTi4,crocs are
kO5FURUKTi4,hey can you guys make a explainer on leverage
kO5FURUKTi4,i dont own croc brand crocs i wear like a cheap brand and they are much better
kO5FURUKTi4,i mean you got to hand it to crocs for consistency they are still as ugly as the day of their conception
kO5FURUKTi4,they are not slip resistant maybe on a coarse ultra dry concrete
kO5FURUKTi4,these are some of the dumbest  ugliest shoes im happy to say ive never own a pair  dont plan too ew
kO5FURUKTi4,another item to add to someones personality
kO5FURUKTi4,its wierd to say crocs as shoes
kO5FURUKTi4,up next the economics of dollar store sandals lol
kO5FURUKTi4,they are quite comfortable and durable
kO5FURUKTi4,is blitzscaling sustainable
kO5FURUKTi4,i would never buy crocs
kO5FURUKTi4,cool series
kO5FURUKTi4,i has crocs before they was crocs back in haiti
kO5FURUKTi4,nice video
kO5FURUKTi4,still figuring out what excites people to wear these shoes in public lol
kO5FURUKTi4,6 shoes selling for 60
kO5FURUKTi4,best to buy crocs
kO5FURUKTi4,crocs arent just comfortable for me
kO5FURUKTi4,i dont like to wear crocs cos it shoes gives me blisters front and back on my foot  lastly its very slippery
kO5FURUKTi4,crocs for the person who has just given up on life
kO5FURUKTi4,wow awesome
kO5FURUKTi4,the grant cardone scam ad is literally at the video beginning of every wsj video
kO5FURUKTi4,please feature decathlon
kO5FURUKTi4,comfort footwear
kO5FURUKTi4,i get rashes when i wear crocs
kO5FURUKTi4,these shoes are so ugly
kO5FURUKTi4,its because of hoopers bro
kO5FURUKTi4,stopped buying because they dont last all of them have a hole in the bottom need more durable soles
kO5FURUKTi4,doctors wear crocs
kO5FURUKTi4,i hate crocs
kO5FURUKTi4,i wouldnt be caught dead in those
kO5FURUKTi4,so wsj tell crocs to make cheap rubber shoes for more sales in every country
kO5FURUKTi4,atleast theyre better than slides
kO5FURUKTi4,nope im a nevercrocker
kO5FURUKTi4,i hate them because i hate loose footwear
kO5FURUKTi4,1 trick pony wit a
kO5FURUKTi4,boat shoes
kO5FURUKTi4,the image is too offensive
kO5FURUKTi4,pe ratio at 6
kO5FURUKTi4,how advertising in wsj
kO5FURUKTi4,black ppl started wearing them thats how
kO5FURUKTi4,60 ytd
kO5FURUKTi4,the next thing in footwear is zelenskis sneakers for those who need to run for their lives should make a killing
kO5FURUKTi4,plastic isnt fashionable not at this stage in climate change think of all those plastic things in the ocean yikes

ItxIvVH3T6o,i love that mat is actually adding sawdust to homemade cookies when actual laws were made to prevent commercial bakers from using sawdust you do you mat
ItxIvVH3T6o,matpat in the christmas of 2030 we are getting gordon ramsay to make a 5 course meal out of a christmas tree
ItxIvVH3T6o,steph i feel sick
ItxIvVH3T6o,theres raw egg in here so im not sure if im supposed to eat it he says eating sawdust dough
ItxIvVH3T6o,tip dont use weight when doing flour substitutes like this if the sawdust is light that means you need more meaning less of  stickiness
ItxIvVH3T6o,i love how stephanie looked absolutely betrayed when she found out she was eating sawdust mat you better get your wife something really nice for christmas
ItxIvVH3T6o,when youre just chilling and eating cookies made from your christmas tree but then you remember that your tree was fake
ItxIvVH3T6o,maybe next year he finally finds out you can turn wood into sugar and alcohol that would be a fun one
ItxIvVH3T6o,i wish there was a food theory on santas caloric intake on christmas eve from all the milk and cookies from around the world
ItxIvVH3T6o,the first thing you did wrong with the creaming of the butter you used the wrong head on your mixer you needed the paddle attachment for wet ingredients
ItxIvVH3T6o,hey matpat for next year why not try seeing if a non toxic tree could be used as wood for barbecue smoked food
ItxIvVH3T6o,i was so confused by the adding saw dust to premade cookies my baker brain was like why
ItxIvVH3T6o,the speed mats look goes from concerned to totally normal at
ItxIvVH3T6o,stephs reaction was the textbook definition of im not mad just disappointed waiting for her to realise literally made me more giddy than waiting for christmas never change matpat
ItxIvVH3T6o,i mean obviously the flour is just more hydrated
ItxIvVH3T6o,i love how matpatt keeps saying we had a crazy idea like this wasnt just his crazy idea like bread gloves
ItxIvVH3T6o,stephanie theres sawdust in this how much sawdust is in here is this whole thing saw oh
ItxIvVH3T6o,if you ever see someone giving out thousands of cookies in january you know the recipe
ItxIvVH3T6o,these are my absolute favourite food theory videos every time youre in that kitchen something terrible is about to happen
ItxIvVH3T6o,matt idea for next christmas
ItxIvVH3T6o,this wouldve been the ideal episode to bring in ro when he said hed be mixing wood flour into premade dough i slammed my face into my desk at work
ItxIvVH3T6o,stephs reaction at
ItxIvVH3T6o,the look on stephs face when mat told her how much sawdust was in the cookie is priceless
ItxIvVH3T6o,the real question is how long was matpat sleeping on the couch after secretly feeding his wife sawdust and recording the whole thing to post to the internet
ItxIvVH3T6o,right when i was missing stephanies commentary she came to give her veredict and it was hilarious xd i laughed so hard
ItxIvVH3T6o,where theres a will theres a way wouldnt be surprised if he made edible cookies out of christmas decorations next
ItxIvVH3T6o,i wonder if it would work with more wet ingredients to compensate for the extra absorbtion of the wood
ItxIvVH3T6o,personally i would have measured out the amount of sawdust vs flour by volume rather than weight to help combat the way sawdust just absorbs water
ItxIvVH3T6o,round three seasoning a meal with sawdust and the leaves see how must you can get away with
ItxIvVH3T6o,i want to see marpat genuinely angry just once
ItxIvVH3T6o,hey matpat little feedback
ItxIvVH3T6o,you know that the editors are true rebels when at
ItxIvVH3T6o,i always ate the new pine needle clumps that sprouted on the tips of pine branches sometime in july and they were really yummy
ItxIvVH3T6o,loving his wifes reaction to the sawdust thing
ItxIvVH3T6o,i want to see if i can make a cookie fully out of a christmas tree now i have ideas already
ItxIvVH3T6o,i still remember trying to hide myself in the fridge even though i was 150 bigger
ItxIvVH3T6o,thus proving our cereal growing up really was sawdust xd also watching mat try to keep it in while steph tries the cookies xd
ItxIvVH3T6o,10k cookies from one tree sounds like a business plan matt start your cookie selling business
ItxIvVH3T6o,fun fact during the great depression they used saw dust instead of flour they usually used it for bread
ItxIvVH3T6o,i love how mat forgot to calculate the weight of each pine needles and the weight of the wood so the amount is probly inaccurate by at least 50 cookies
ItxIvVH3T6o,matpat kneading dough while talking
ItxIvVH3T6o,perfect now for new years i know how much of my dead christmas tree i can get away with feeding to my most hated coworkers thanks matpat
ItxIvVH3T6o,i love how steph was so done with matpat when he announced it was sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,this video makes me so happy its just pure shenanigans and i love it
ItxIvVH3T6o,i feel weird right now because i was always taught that you mix the powders first and then you add the wet ingredients
ItxIvVH3T6o,id like to see the flour substituted by mass i think doing it by weight throws it off too much
ItxIvVH3T6o,i like the part where when mat tells the editor to move the chart the editor moves it in the wrong places its hilarious
ItxIvVH3T6o,lmfao you guys make me laugh to the point i drool and its amazing xd
ItxIvVH3T6o,helpful tip in getting all the cookies eaten sharing is caring 3
ItxIvVH3T6o,mat you should start cooking more often its funny watching you
ItxIvVH3T6o,boiling pine leaves can make good tea sapping pun intended all the flavor out of that pine is still using it
ItxIvVH3T6o,im starting to think matpat has an addiction to eating christmas trees
ItxIvVH3T6o,funny enough in denmark we have a christmas song where the lyrics go since it the christmas tree shall be eaten
ItxIvVH3T6o,interesting idea though im just concerned about impaction in the gut from eating sawdust
ItxIvVH3T6o,by volume makes more sense than  by weight  thats why you use cups to measure your flour not scales
ItxIvVH3T6o,to be frank im excited for the third installment of this
ItxIvVH3T6o,wonder if you could make the icing with a kind of pine flavour from the needles
ItxIvVH3T6o,i love stephs face when matt tells her whats in the cookies
ItxIvVH3T6o,you may be able to solve the dryness issue by adding more of the wet ingredients
ItxIvVH3T6o,wonder what hes gonna try next round smoothies from the tree bread ice cream breading for chicken nuggets
ItxIvVH3T6o,you can consume it but just dont breathe it in
ItxIvVH3T6o,sneaking sawdust to santa clause implies that steph is in fact st nick
ItxIvVH3T6o,we are back after considering our life choices
ItxIvVH3T6o,im excited for this years edition where he hides wood in eggnog
ItxIvVH3T6o,if he does this for a third year in a row stephs gonna have to come up with some revenge theories
ItxIvVH3T6o,stephanie is such a nice wife i feel like she could definitely tell starting at 10 but still gave him the benefit of the doubt
ItxIvVH3T6o,matpat in the fridge saying leave me alone is a mood
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,bring in for sworn live testimony the two agents who are disputing the story that was shared with ms hutchinson about yrumps action within the presidential
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,they seem to think that if they tell the lie over  over  over  over  over  over again itll magically become true
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,my favorite part of the jan 6th hearing was when they said trump said its trumping time and trumped all over nancy pelosis face
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,judging by the comments nobody believe this crap dont need to see the dislikes to know this video just got ratiod
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,how crazy does crazy need to get for people to wake up this continues to drag on and on weve lost our way as a society
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,this is the government our founders warned us about
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,revealed january 6 committee didnt reach out to secret service in days before cassidy hutchinsons testimony
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,this is exactly how it went down trump screamed this is maga country beat up the secret service agent and poured bleach on him i couldnt believe my eyes
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,does the  justice department do anything other then decline charges
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,dont forget that the supreme court ruled in 2006 that the federal bureau of investigation may impersonate journalists
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,how do you control emotion
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,no subpoena for the limo agents
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,when you find nothing so you hype up a star witness to say trump tried to grab the steering wheel but secret service agents debunk that in hours
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,can we also charge the police with unjustified shootings for inciting civil unrest that started the riots that almost cost us our country that would easily border on treason
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,i think its time these committee members got another booster theyre wasting too much time and too much money on this nonsense
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,my favorite part of the hearing yesterday was at the end
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,is there an issue of attorney client privilege also executive privilege
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,we already know the list of people that ask for pardons ahead of time  some of them even stated such on television
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,how can you subpoena someone for a fake trial without swearing anyone in strange
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,political theater our tax dollars at work ladies  gentlemen
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,and then he stuck his head out of the sun roof and started screaming racial slurs at children on the sidewalk
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,just seen cipollone has agreed to testify this should be good
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,now trump looks dumb for firing so many staff members most of them have no problem taking the stand
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,this is who the government is and not one damn thing more nothing
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,this is the circus of the century their start witnesses testimonyi heard from my ex boyfriends moms cousin that her yoga instructor heard from a client that trump was mad
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,the jan 6 circus is just like wile e coyoteand just as hilarious
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,cipollone was not part of the coup neither was ms hutchinson they just got caught in it maybe cipollone answers the subpoena
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,so hell just deny the subpoena like all of the others
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,anyone notice how pat cipollone actually sounds like pass the baloney  how
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,come on utube put the thumbs down count back up for everyone to see just for the laughs
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,after this i hope they dig up jimmy hoffa to testify because itd be money well spent
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,the current and future republican enemies of democracy like pat cipollone identified by the 6 jan committee deserve a date in criminal court with lady justice
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,get them under oath enough talk
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,this is my last post as i have some research on xai i desperately need to
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,is this still going on lmao
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,pretty sure all of these people are liars lol
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,the lady faithfully said that to best of her knowledge other people can investigate of course but regardless the result she wasnt lying
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,these people need to speak up americans want the truth and they can at least gain some sense of dignity before they get prosecuted
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,will his testimony be true or another lying witness
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,im so excited i found a song i hadnt heard in years called capital tropical by two man sound  you should give it a listen it really gets you moving
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,cipollone will just stall and run out the clock
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,im going to tell people the sky is purple until they believe it
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,bombshells and sea shells are looking more and more alike
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,finally the hearings gets more juicy
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,the girl is an anchor now good job
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,should be easy enough to prove who wrote the note basic handwriting analysis

5Wv4Q7zMHMA,the screws are tightening as we speak you can run but you can not hide
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,ive never seen a group of people so obsessed with another person
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,turns out we didnt need the barnum and bailey circus after all we have cnbc
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,1 john 41 beloved do not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from god because many false prophets have gone out into the world
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,when liz cheney is voted out this year the jan 6th circus will be short one clown
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,if its found that hutchinson is lying oh well what does anyone expect from the trump wh
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,the sham 6 committee
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,and the charade continues
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,cant wait to see this much attention applied to that dirty little laptop
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,so why dont they subpoena the secret service
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,a source close to the secret service
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,lets just sweep the attempted destruction of americas democracy under the rug
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,high in ideas but low in results open minded people are easily hypnotized
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,hold trump accountable for threatening a witness
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,why the doj declined to prosecute meadows for contempt to congress helping trump mr garland
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,lock him up lmao
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,if only trump would tesitfy under oath maybe we could finally get to the bottom of it its just so bizarre that he wont
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,grasping as straws continues
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,grasping for straws
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,you realize trumpians will think his fight to go to the capital is a good thing and that means his is even more of a hero
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,bring the agents the cassidy lady spoke of i swear how can people not see passed this circus for what it s
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,so after the cassidy hutchinson testimony fell apart they need to regroup and find something new to get him on maybe jaywalking is next
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,lock them up lock them up  the irony is incredible
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,i would not vote for democrat even a single time in my whole life thanks biden to help me make that decision
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,meanwhile my 401k is down 20
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,liz cheney 2024 she is a true american patriot
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,biden is better off calling out bingo numbers at his nursing home

5Wv4Q7zMHMA,who needs to go to 10 or more different ballot drop boxes to vote 
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,every day we get more and more evidence why the dislike button was removed
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,is this about hunter biden lets go brandon
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,god bless the january 6th committee and god bless america 
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,maybe have the fbi do more show arrests nonsense
5Wv4Q7zMHMA,its so bizarre that donald trump wont testify under oath to clear his name

A3QhFD9g43w,my fashion journey continues
A3QhFD9g43w,that valentino coat is everything i think the outfits by 200 stylist are more editorial whereas the cheaper stylist is more normal everyday outfits
A3QhFD9g43w,the valentino leather coat is just one of the best things ever the pleating on the back makes it so different and interesting
A3QhFD9g43w,coming from someone who has a rotating wardrobe of 7 tshirts and 3 pair of pants i loved this video you made me actually want to attempt looking nice thanks
A3QhFD9g43w,while i fully agree than your favorite outfit is stunning on you the second outfit from the 200  stylist can not be ignored that green looks incredible on you
A3QhFD9g43w,i have to say that i actually did like the grandma curtains dress on you together with boots id just put my hair up or braid it for that one
A3QhFD9g43w,hey heres my ratings and rambling thoughts on the outfits
A3QhFD9g43w,expensive stylist
A3QhFD9g43w,it feels like the biggest problem of expensive outfits was clothes not fitting on the figure
A3QhFD9g43w,expensive stylist outfit 2 was my fav versatile and classy  but some of the fits from both stylists were very weird to me
A3QhFD9g43w,the denim jumpsuit you started with was fantastic and thought not one of the ones to be rated i still did lol
A3QhFD9g43w,i am a fan of the open toe boot the stylists dropped the ball on making a cohesive look that matched your taste and everyday lifestyle
A3QhFD9g43w,make a vdeo subscribers style me for a week or something not to brag but i have a feeling wed make better choices
A3QhFD9g43w,outfit 1 love only the jacket
A3QhFD9g43w,i loved outfit 2 from the expensive stylist the green brown and cream coat looked incredible on you
A3QhFD9g43w,20 stylist my opinion
A3QhFD9g43w,girl i hate these fashion thingsbut you had me dying laughing out loud with my headphones on you are hysterical
A3QhFD9g43w,the even number options from the more expensive stylist were the best imo
A3QhFD9g43w,you do have fashion style you know what is good and what is a mess when you are trying this outfits
A3QhFD9g43w,outfit 2 from the more expensive stylist was my absolute favourite 1010 such a flattering silhouette and the colours looked amazing and classic together
A3QhFD9g43w,first outfit love the coat shorts do look like you kill pheasants 510
A3QhFD9g43w,that valentino jacket is stunning my thoughts since you asked
A3QhFD9g43w,look 3 on the professional was stunning i love brown and grey they go so well together so im glad theres something that id wear coming from a stylist 
A3QhFD9g43w,i just found your channel and anyway i had to say i love your natural bedheadmismatched unstyled style too fun video
A3QhFD9g43w,outfit number 2 is gorgeous i actually love it without the coat and the bag because it fits you so well
A3QhFD9g43w,the second outfit looked perfect on you im laughing so hard with this video omg loved it
A3QhFD9g43w,i love that green top in the second outfit i have a similar shirt in lavender but it was on clearance 700 its my favorite clothing purchase ever
A3QhFD9g43w,the 20 stylist reminded me of tiktok fashion hacks
A3QhFD9g43w,such a cute video finding your style figuring out what cuts fit you best and building your wardrobe costs a lot of time and money unfortunately
A3QhFD9g43w,this was really cool to see tbh i also was in love with that two piece set that you liked and the valentino coat cool as all get out
A3QhFD9g43w,i loved the boots and valentino jacket  outfit 2  3 i hope you kept them also the yellow dress was fantastic
A3QhFD9g43w,love the outfit 4 i just purchased the same paco rabanne skirt in blue and silver pattern and i love the style so so much
A3QhFD9g43w,i really liked outfit 2 on you  you could dress it up or down maybe with the black chunky boots to give it an edge i like mixing femininemasculine pieces
A3QhFD9g43w,1st outfit very beautiful you look awesome in it
A3QhFD9g43w,i love styling videos and i love how genuine you are but not a fan of how it goes hand in hand with overconsumption
A3QhFD9g43w,watching you react to the look books cant stop wanting to say you have to try them on before you judge
A3QhFD9g43w,the 2 outfit from the more expensive stylist was really great at least a 9 i would add a brown belt but other than that it looked perfect on you
A3QhFD9g43w,ok the valentino coat is gorgeous i also loved the expensive boots and black bag yes the gray suit is the best of them all
A3QhFD9g43w,it wasnt really brought up but that first black mesh shirt looked really good and felt like itd be a great basic for layering with a fashionable edge
A3QhFD9g43w,you should definitely keep
A3QhFD9g43w,absolutely fabulous with outfit 2 from 200 stylist please say you kept it and i also really enjoyed outfit 4 from that same stylistgood call with the more baggy pants
A3QhFD9g43w,percentage wise i preferred the more expensive ones by far plus they tried to combine several outfits out of the same pieces and i appreciate that
A3QhFD9g43w,interesting experience id like to try hiring a stylist one day wanna see what can they do with my crazy clothes preferences

Dm20K7k_Pgw,i remember walgreens at broadview plaza in atlanta had a diner in the early sixties they served a passable salisbury steak
i4VYvP8X1IY,every single media outlet that covered this up should be held accountable along with hunter joe and anyone else on that laptop
i4VYvP8X1IY,im so disappointed in the military and law enforcement agencies are they really going to sell their souls for this administration really
i4VYvP8X1IY,this story should have been broadcast 247 for the last month before the election
i4VYvP8X1IY,never thought it was possible for me to dislike a president more than obummer but here we go
i4VYvP8X1IY,when the hell are hunter and his dad going to be held accountable the hypocrisy is unbelievable
i4VYvP8X1IY,how can a country prosper when such dishonesty is taking place on the highest level   whatever happened to leading by example
i4VYvP8X1IY,anybody who believes joe didnt know is willfully blind
i4VYvP8X1IY,hunters personal lawyer tried to buy back his clients laptop from the repair shop  sounds like an admission to guilt to a logical person
i4VYvP8X1IY,sure wish this administration would spend a fraction of the timeeffort as they did on trump and on jan 6 now
i4VYvP8X1IY,this is what happens when career criminal politicians go unpunished for their criminal actions i hope one day they rot in a cell where they belong
i4VYvP8X1IY,its sad that the msm in the us isnt doing their job and that it is a british tabloid that is doing their job for them
i4VYvP8X1IY,i think youre clear translates to
i4VYvP8X1IY,like father like son corrupted to the bone
i4VYvP8X1IY,i hope this reporter is in a safe place preferably outside the usa
i4VYvP8X1IY,im just impressed they got this audio how in the world did they do it fantastic work keep up the good work and thank you very much
i4VYvP8X1IY,who said trump was corrupt in his relationships with foreign countries and who spent so much time and tax payers money trying and failing to prove it
i4VYvP8X1IY,if only we had patriots to enforce the laws
i4VYvP8X1IY,it goes to the same place hillarys russian uranium deal hunters laptop bills lolita express trips etc  it disappears
i4VYvP8X1IY,we know we have criminals running the show question is who will prosecute
i4VYvP8X1IY,for the life of me ill never understand the double standard for why the left is never held accountable
i4VYvP8X1IY,these guys are criminals liars  and corrupt and the old one got his finger on the button
i4VYvP8X1IY,those who were involved in covering this highly immoral act should be held accountable
i4VYvP8X1IY,dont forget hunter 10 for the big guy
i4VYvP8X1IY,ive never talked to my son about his business overseas joe biden
i4VYvP8X1IY,i imagine that reporter will have some federal agents showing up at his house soon to confiscate all his electronics
i4VYvP8X1IY,we have a president who clearly does not know right from wrong
i4VYvP8X1IY,this shows an ability to control what the media released and actively using it
i4VYvP8X1IY,these people lie as easily as they breathe
i4VYvP8X1IY,as close as they were no way in hell biden didnt know
i4VYvP8X1IY,nothing is ever going to come of thisobviously this family will never be accountable for anything actually the entire democratic party will never be accountable for anything money talks
i4VYvP8X1IY,brandon directed hunter hes the big guy the head of the family syndicate  dc is full of these families lgb
i4VYvP8X1IY,of course joe knew he got richer from hunters dealings  i think everyone knows
i4VYvP8X1IY,it really came down to joes constiuency not doing their homework and of course dominion in the 2020 election
i4VYvP8X1IY,yup and this goes by the wayside just like everything else no consequences
i4VYvP8X1IY,it would be nice for this to be investigated
i4VYvP8X1IY,i think youre clear this line might just go down in history
i4VYvP8X1IY,josh stay safe you play a dangerous game when you expose the elites
i4VYvP8X1IY,when will they stop pretending hunter was the deal maker  not just the bag man
i4VYvP8X1IY,i am grateful and feel sorry for reporters who tirelessly investigate the left knowing nothing will ever get done
i4VYvP8X1IY,one positive thing that joe biden has done he said he would be transparent and he has been because i think we can all see right through him cant we
i4VYvP8X1IY,even when leaving a telephone message for his son the tone of his voice and cadence of his speech is submissive
i4VYvP8X1IY,now this is an impeachable worthy phone call unlike the phone call  trump had  right
i4VYvP8X1IY,fox you better run this 247
i4VYvP8X1IY,watch over josh lord keep him safe in jesus name amen
i4VYvP8X1IY,calling joe biden the president is like calling  ed gein a skilled clothing and housewares manufacturer
i4VYvP8X1IY,these characters need 100 years in the state penitentiary
i4VYvP8X1IY,hunter is the smartest man i know  brandon
i4VYvP8X1IY,right from the pressys mouth the american people can go without a couple of meals let them eat lentils put that video back up
i4VYvP8X1IY,when you cover criminal behavior youre as evil as the person who committed the crime even if that person is your child
i4VYvP8X1IY,a wise man keepeth his mouth and keepeth his life birds get caught by their feet man will get caught by their tongues wise words indeed
i4VYvP8X1IY,we already know that 10 goes to the big guy im just wondering what the percentage is that goes to the media to cover it up
i4VYvP8X1IY,how long will this treason be allowed
i4VYvP8X1IY,i was wondering what would take independent honest journalist so long to expose boe hiden
i4VYvP8X1IY,you can bet the sleepy joe family wished this was about the trump family
i4VYvP8X1IY,wish trump had that call during the debates right in bidens face
i4VYvP8X1IY,the laptop from hell coined by djt 2020 at various campaign rallies those were the days
i4VYvP8X1IY,we the people want justicein jesus name
i4VYvP8X1IY,as trump said time to drain the swamp so sick of this bs hell they took down a president for the watergate affair
i4VYvP8X1IY,our two tier system of justice at work
i4VYvP8X1IY,i find it just insane that we are allowing these criminals to stay in power
i4VYvP8X1IY,god i hope the republicans take the house and the senate and put an end to this madness
i4VYvP8X1IY,bought and paid for by china and ukraine and russia
i4VYvP8X1IY,the most astounding part of this is that joe biden is so old that he is leaving voicemails
i4VYvP8X1IY,great work keep exposing the truth
i4VYvP8X1IY,outstanding report thanks for not letting this issue drop
i4VYvP8X1IY,weve known for a long time now whats the  point of bringing it up now
i4VYvP8X1IY,make sure of two things be careful  microphones are always hot and understand that in washington dc a gaffe is when you tell the truth so be careful  joe biden
i4VYvP8X1IY,chances are that obama knew what was going on as well
i4VYvP8X1IY,the day our government tells us whats really going on is the day i surpass elon musk in net worth
i4VYvP8X1IY,the president cant find a best side of neck to talk from none of them alone
i4VYvP8X1IY,the media and high profile politicians have always been like this  but most never knew it  it didnt just start happening recently 
i4VYvP8X1IY,he was talking about hunters paternity test and he was wrong about that like everything else he says
i4VYvP8X1IY,i cant understand how these people  got where they are  and remain there in spite of all of the evidence of the criminal activity
i4VYvP8X1IY,this is why the 16 committee is having an emergency hearing distraction
i4VYvP8X1IY,balance needs to be restored in the house and senate in novemberthese criminals are operating with impunity
i4VYvP8X1IY,she wasnt even in the room when i asked for a pardon rudy guliani
i4VYvP8X1IY,i think youre in the clear  brandon
i4VYvP8X1IY,this is so insane could u imagine trump taking to trump jr like this on recording
i4VYvP8X1IY,wheres aoc calling out joe as liar under oath
i4VYvP8X1IY,cant wait for peter dooci to ask the press secretary about it
i4VYvP8X1IY,joes just talking about hunters scientology audit he hopes to reach the tom cruise deluxe level soon
i4VYvP8X1IY,my condolensces to joshs family poor guy so young
i4VYvP8X1IY,no worries though if it really comes down to it i believe joe could plead insanity and get away with it
i4VYvP8X1IY,truth always prevails these corrupt politicians will get thrown in the fire in this life or the next praying that justice is served accordingly and good politicians take over
i4VYvP8X1IY,we need some transparency from the white house 
i4VYvP8X1IY,multiple choice
-njHjebtIg4,mad respect that you can hang out with elon and review his cars but still remain independent enough to call tesla out on their marketing
-njHjebtIg4,yes i have been harmed by tech company lies
-njHjebtIg4,elon is the king of vaporware i never believe his announcements until theyre fully released  theyre rarely the same
-njHjebtIg4,i petition camera sensors should have a naming scheme like tvs maybe mm diagonal super easy and straightforward
-njHjebtIg4,this was a good video but i feel like theres still a lot more that could be explored for this topic would love a part two
-njHjebtIg4,you have just blown my mind on the 1inch sensor fact we need to start a petition for companies to use realistic terms
-njHjebtIg4,marquis you do such a great job id love to have more people with your level of integrity in mainstream entertainment and information media
-njHjebtIg4,my favorite is teslas potential savings default price for their cars which includes potential incentives and gas savings of 4300
-njHjebtIg4,the 1inch sensor thing is mind blowing thank you for nudging the world toward truth love this video
-njHjebtIg4,good to see someone learning more and more about cars and stating facts
-njHjebtIg4,thank you very informative and you are easy to listen to
-njHjebtIg4,wow  i had no idea about the 1 inch sensor measurement that is fascinating
-njHjebtIg4,tech companies must have a hate how much i love you kinda relationship with mkbhd   
-njHjebtIg4,heres how that would line up against some of the fastest cars ever madeliterally the first car on the list  prius
-njHjebtIg4,thank you for making videos like these marques thats what makes you a true reviewer kudos
-njHjebtIg4,im sure the new roadster will be able to do the sub 2 second 060 without a rollout because it should be a lot lighter than the model s plaid
-njHjebtIg4,another misconception transistors
-njHjebtIg4,i have to give it to you marques you are a very smart man
-njHjebtIg4,this was a fun topic for a video my bet is first roadsters ship end of 2023 but we all know elon time
-njHjebtIg4,as usual thank you for being honest and objective on your channel even if its about your favorite companies
-njHjebtIg4,polluted by the big company hope you keep up the good work
-njHjebtIg4,lets vote yes for the proliferation of this kind of reasonableness
-njHjebtIg4,sound and speaker companies do it worse the claims and measurements which they do themselves are waaaay off from reality
-njHjebtIg4,musk has been known to inflate things quite a lot plus is always far too optimistic about release dates not to mention many lies
-njHjebtIg4,wow that 1 inch sensor thing blew my mind
-njHjebtIg4,well done youtuber for pointing out what others discovered now hold your thumb and forefinger apart and tell us you have never called that 6inches
-njHjebtIg4,camera and met everything i wanted i do feel deceived i am really enjoying these different videos youre putting out very informative and interesting content
-njHjebtIg4,thanks for making videos like this more people needed to question and not just accept what they are told
-njHjebtIg4,good job  very informative thanks
-njHjebtIg4,this is definitely my favorite video of yours  because of the drag strip animation frankly
-njHjebtIg4,thats enough about the tesla roadster lets move on to something completely different called vaporware
-njHjebtIg4,you may also be surprised to learn wood is measured as a 2x4 when its actually like 15x35 same for all new wood today compared to the old stuff
-njHjebtIg4,of course they want you to think its a 1 diagonal sensor like at
-njHjebtIg4,proud of people like you bro keep up the good work
-njHjebtIg4,thank you very much for your great explanation
-njHjebtIg4,as a donut media
-njHjebtIg4,the one inch sensor term reminds me of how we use horsepower nowadays to equate engine performance but not relating to actual hoses anymore
-njHjebtIg4,incredibly indepth insightful vid thanks for posting m
-njHjebtIg4,actually i did know 1 sensors are not 1 vbecause i wanted to compare it to my apsc and got kinda confused when i checked the measurements
-njHjebtIg4,cool video you may want to revisit some of things you were told and then reported on with the f150 lightning definitely some miss informationvapor ware going on there
-njHjebtIg4,the way dji literally had iconography showing a 1 diagonal measurement likely a misunderstanding by marketing but feels worse
-njHjebtIg4,has anything elon said come true
-njHjebtIg4,great video shining light into several examples of pretty much misleading advertising
-njHjebtIg4,i thought it was weird that they made a sensor that big and it wasnt much better than outgoing cameras with tiny little sensors
-njHjebtIg4,excellent quality and great s authentic and genuine i love this 100 effective method for this game so unique and for sharing
-njHjebtIg4,i just love the way you thinkthank you for doing this videos
-njHjebtIg4,great analysis welcome to the wide world of advertising but not the  world of reality
-njHjebtIg4,good information  its good to hear the real truth about the marketing of these tech products we buy
-njHjebtIg4,would be interesting to have a when companies tell us the truth video
-njHjebtIg4,the amount of research you do is incredible
-njHjebtIg4,i like hearing the truth about this sort of thing i never would have known about the 1 sensor thing if you didnt tell me
-njHjebtIg4,this was such a great vid this is why i watch you youre informative in ways that fascinates and intrigues i could watch more vids on content like this
mS4Y_avaBWw,are you subscribed to the second channel more minecraft news video can be found there 
mS4Y_avaBWw,if you make a bad thing on the lab table it gives you garbage
mS4Y_avaBWw,chemistry sounds like potions with extra steps
mS4Y_avaBWw,as a chemistry student in my final year of school i can confirm about 50 of this is accurate d
mS4Y_avaBWw,uses glowstick
mS4Y_avaBWw,ima do timestamps because im the hero we dont need but we appreciate and sometimes want
mS4Y_avaBWw,mojang lets make educational edition so kids study while having fun
mS4Y_avaBWw,mom why arent you studying for your chemistry test
mS4Y_avaBWw,finally someone is more clueless at chemistry than i am
mS4Y_avaBWw,your natural inclination towards making these items in particular is why we cant buy really cool chemistry sets anymore
mS4Y_avaBWw,education edition actually made me so much more interested into minecraft than i shouldve epic gamechanger for me
mS4Y_avaBWw,this was so fun but as a lover of science your mispronunciations of the items was adorable and also made me die a little inside
mS4Y_avaBWw,when you realize the compound creator is just a cauldron retextured
mS4Y_avaBWw,the way xisuma pronounces stuff is very pure an uncontaminated soul untouched by the chemistry menace
mS4Y_avaBWw,take a shot every time xisuma pronounces something wrong i love it derp
mS4Y_avaBWw,i once thought that x was a pure java player and that hed only do a bedrock video when pigs fly
mS4Y_avaBWw,wonder if we will get those options in java edition as well
mS4Y_avaBWw,i study chemistry at university and lost so many brain cells listening to the way x pronounces the elements and compounds
mS4Y_avaBWw,mom stop playing that game thats for kids
mS4Y_avaBWw,now the real question is can antvenom break it
mS4Y_avaBWw,imagine that one kid who is going to craft hydrogen cyanide
mS4Y_avaBWw,id love some of this in vanilla separator different tonics reinforced glass and underwater torches all sound awesome to me
mS4Y_avaBWw,btw i think its interesting when you put soul sand or netehrrack in material reducer
mS4Y_avaBWw,super fertilizer is basically just old bonemeal
mS4Y_avaBWw,as someone with a masters in chemistry i cant explain to you how happy this makes me 
mS4Y_avaBWw,i know this is three years later but i just subscribed because you really helped me with ed mode and you deserved it
mS4Y_avaBWw,i love how they also put the newest elements into the game
mS4Y_avaBWw,the element constructor works backwards which is really cool put in elements in the slot and you can see the particles
mS4Y_avaBWw,i love how xisuma is learning chemistry throughout the whole video
mS4Y_avaBWw,love that update on education edition  i wish it was on java edition so we can try that 
mS4Y_avaBWw,if you can attach balloons to entities using a dispenser this could be really really interestinguseful for moving mobs vertically
mS4Y_avaBWw,molybdenum is pronounced like mulibdenum
mS4Y_avaBWw,the underwater torch looks like the soul torch that we have now
mS4Y_avaBWw,part of me wants this to be added to the base game not just education edition its actually really cool
mS4Y_avaBWw,do the blocks that you use to create and combine elements replace normal blocks also is it possible to do education edition in survival
mS4Y_avaBWw,when science is your most hated subject but this happens
mS4Y_avaBWw,these are really cool items i hope this means we will eventually get colored torches in vanilla minecraft just with a different crafting recipe of course
mS4Y_avaBWw,to be honest this is far more amazing for me than the aquatic update and those dolphins no hate please
mS4Y_avaBWw,ive been interested in how tings work chemistry and such lately and i recognized all the names of the chemicals
mS4Y_avaBWw,the sparklers should definitely be in vanilla
mS4Y_avaBWw,xisuma and i can take as much oil as i want
mS4Y_avaBWw,this is soooo cool
mS4Y_avaBWw,i am flashed 4 of the new elements including oganesson are on there they were discovered in 2017
mS4Y_avaBWw,as an undergrad chemist this really interests me and means i can play minecraft without feeling guilty about time wasting some of those funny mispronunciations hurt me a little though
mS4Y_avaBWw,can you do effect speed when holding the sparkleri think that would be cool
mS4Y_avaBWw,the only bedrock update that made me a java player go wow thats actually really cool
mS4Y_avaBWw,this is so cool i cant wait to see more
mS4Y_avaBWw,you helped a lot to make new stuff for me now i am in love with science
mS4Y_avaBWw,oh god i thought the element constructor had a circle for a second
mS4Y_avaBWw,this is actually pretty dope not gonna lie id love to see similar stuff outside of education edition
mS4Y_avaBWw,im a java player  and id like to say i love that minecraft does make a feature that is unique to bedrock 
mS4Y_avaBWw,could be interesting to use for a skyblock style map beginning with only the chemistry lab blocks
mS4Y_avaBWw,this is very useful to me
mS4Y_avaBWw,for me the eyedrops look the same as every other potion from edu
mS4Y_avaBWw,i really want these features in the vanilla game for some reason
mS4Y_avaBWw,electrons move super fast around the nucleus which contains the protons and neutrons
mS4Y_avaBWw,ive never been so in love with minecraft
mS4Y_avaBWw,xisuma a professor outside but a derp inside
mS4Y_avaBWw,what if you throw that ice bombthing while underwater
mS4Y_avaBWw,i really hope that mojang allows us to do this after the beta
mS4Y_avaBWw,i had no idea mojang actually put so much effort into edu edition when i first tried it i had no idea what it was
mS4Y_avaBWw,thank you because this lesson is valuable 
mS4Y_avaBWw,this is actually really cool this is the first time you can really learn from minecraft edu or more than before
mS4Y_avaBWw,doing these made me pass my pre chemistry section in science weird how that works
mS4Y_avaBWw,thank you for the video it came for great resources
mS4Y_avaBWw,in all honestly this feels like a mod just waiting to happen just make the elements more appropriately avalible and youre good
mS4Y_avaBWw,i remember watching this to learn how to craft everything 4 years ago now
mS4Y_avaBWw,i just passed chemistry and i can verify that this stuff is indeed scientifically accurate
mS4Y_avaBWw,flash forward to nether update we now have the sodium torchwater torch texture lol for soul torch in vanilla
mS4Y_avaBWw,i am a beta tester for mcpe for almost 3 years gotta say evolutionary
mS4Y_avaBWw,this is fantastic and could be awesome in vanilla standard minecraft its like a mod
mS4Y_avaBWw,oh that periodic table in the start is just beautiful i love it
mS4Y_avaBWw,with the underwater tnt you can make an ultra player launcher
mS4Y_avaBWw,next theyre going to do biology because minecraft avoids physics
PvVdn6QNres,click this now please
PvVdn6QNres,netflix hire this man to do the english dub its better than the real one
PvVdn6QNres,the main characters with their faces plastered on them is so hilarious yet scary
PvVdn6QNres,i love how the actors real faces are wrapped around the 3d models
PvVdn6QNres,the graphics are so realistic youd almost think you were watching squid game
PvVdn6QNres,we have squid game at home is now just the netflix series this is actually the real deal
PvVdn6QNres,i love how they just slapped a low quality image of the main characters faces onto the model and went yep this is what they look like
PvVdn6QNres,thanks surreal now i dont have to watch the actual show
PvVdn6QNres,i like to imagine this is how surreal sees the world
PvVdn6QNres,even if he skipped a whole damn chapter its funny
PvVdn6QNres,squid game more like squish game my favourite quote of the 500 billion years
PvVdn6QNres,i like how all the main protagonists have detailed faces
PvVdn6QNres,im pretty sure 255 billion won is at least 3
PvVdn6QNres,watching this made me feel like consciously having a weird dream
PvVdn6QNres,this is still a better dub than the official version
PvVdn6QNres,this actually gives me a lil nostalgia to the simpler times where his animations wherent super detailed
PvVdn6QNres,dont move or you die
PvVdn6QNres,this one looks more real than the actual squid game this mans a legend
PvVdn6QNres,dont let the doll see you moving or you be dead
PvVdn6QNres,this is the most accurate summary of the squid games i might just cry
PvVdn6QNres,i really like how the narrator says no questions allowed like its a library or something
PvVdn6QNres,i cried watching this it was deeper in depth and gave me a better understanding of the series
PvVdn6QNres,they really upped the acting for this one
PvVdn6QNres,the real faces of people being placed onto the 3d characters looks like something out of a chillas art game
PvVdn6QNres,i love that this is a full summary of the story but has no spoilers
PvVdn6QNres,havent watched that show dont think i ever will thanks for the wonderful version you made
PvVdn6QNres,as someone who litterally like 4 minutes ago finished watching last episode i can confirm thats exactly how it went
PvVdn6QNres,i wish my parents could understand the level of humour ive reached
PvVdn6QNres,squid game more like squish game
PvVdn6QNres,the voice acting here is more convincing than the english dub
PvVdn6QNres,i love how the entire show is just about people getting quickscoped because they have a major skill issue
PvVdn6QNres,as someone who has never seen squid game in my life this is completely accurate
PvVdn6QNres,the doll in this version is way more scarier than the original
PvVdn6QNres,squid game more like squish game
PvVdn6QNres,i love the detail and effort put into this people need to appreciate artists like this more often because this is true talent
PvVdn6QNres,this is actually how the dub sounded
PvVdn6QNres,the way sangwoos face is warped on the characters head i cant
PvVdn6QNres,this is wayyyyy better than the squid game english dub
PvVdn6QNres,ok but i love how the npc characters have slots for mouths like the ones vending machines have to receive money
PvVdn6QNres,squid game more like squish game
PvVdn6QNres,awwww the characters are so adorable cracking their bones and the faces are so evenly detailed
PvVdn6QNres,their isnt even any squid very disappointing
PvVdn6QNres,lmao how the doll shoots everyone except the main characters
PvVdn6QNres,when the dude died after saying i have questions i felt that
PvVdn6QNres,i like how youre appealing to the humour side now instead of random animations still cant watch at night tho
PvVdn6QNres,i love how in the beginning if you look closely he added himself in
PvVdn6QNres,this is canon
PvVdn6QNres,watching the whole series again would feel faster than this
PvVdn6QNres,i havent seen the show so i belive this is 100 accurate to what the experience is like
PvVdn6QNres,i love the fact that you killed off the old man even though it is pretty clear he runs the games
PvVdn6QNres,player 212we dont care we still want to leave
PvVdn6QNres,i cant escape this series its everywhere
PvVdn6QNres,lol the doll after crushing those two dudes did one of the smoothest running animations ive seen on this channel was probably the oddest thing about the clip
PvVdn6QNres,im literally watching squid game right now and i was thinking surreal entertainment is prolly gonna make a video on this
PvVdn6QNres,since im gore sensitive this is literally all the knowledge of squid game im gonna get
PvVdn6QNres,i like how they just walk vertically and red light green light
PvVdn6QNres,the viewer converting the wons to dollars is the most accurate thing ever
PvVdn6QNres,this make me feel an emotion that actually exist
PvVdn6QNres,im crying at how accurate this is

PvVdn6QNres,wow what a realistic face better than the original squid game
PvVdn6QNres,man netflix needs to hire this man
PvVdn6QNres,i love how only the main characters have their faces
PvVdn6QNres,the amount it effort it took to make it look like there was no effort put it in it is jsut amazing
PvVdn6QNres,i love this so everyone can watch and the show isnt spoiled
PvVdn6QNres,i just love how their faces are just casually printed on the head
PvVdn6QNres,lets have a moment of silence for those people who cant afford netflix 
PvVdn6QNres,i watched all nine episodes in one day and i can confirm that this is almost exactly what it is
PvVdn6QNres,id pay 100 to watch a full version of this
PvVdn6QNres,its hilarious how everything is wierd animation but them getting squished was the most chefs kiss animation ever lol
PvVdn6QNres,kid mom can i watch the squid games

QeiYLF-JaY0,reason to continue
0F8CKpe4UHc,proof that dave and chris are professional comedians
0F8CKpe4UHc,chris rock was meant to be there for that moment
0F8CKpe4UHc,doesnt matter how easy that joke was it was still hilarious
0F8CKpe4UHc,cant imagine how long chris rock kept that joke bottled up inside
0F8CKpe4UHc,chris rock sure knows how to lighten a terrible situation with a joke
0F8CKpe4UHc,chris rock stole the show with that joke lol
0F8CKpe4UHc,that had to be the most absolutely perfectly timed joke
0F8CKpe4UHc,this is how it goes if a noncelebrity person attacks a comic  weird how will smith didnt get arrested or taken away
0F8CKpe4UHc,perfect chris rock hasnt even started on will smith yet this was low hanging fruit he couldnt resist
0F8CKpe4UHc,when i heard chris rock say that i started laughing so hard i couldnt breathe what an absolute legend
0F8CKpe4UHc,glad this incident ended well chris rock  is a comic genius
0F8CKpe4UHc,next up chappelles attacker is given an oscar by the motion picture academy
0F8CKpe4UHc,that was chris rocks release good for him
0F8CKpe4UHc,chris rockwas that will smith  will gonna get his feelings hurt again the pursuit of slappyness cant wait to see it
0F8CKpe4UHc,chris rock rocks immediately lightening the mood and showing that willy boi has nothing on him
0F8CKpe4UHc,superficial injuries  the guy looked like human piata after they were done with him let alone that gimpy arm
0F8CKpe4UHc,man jamie fox is a great guy talented actor and a great guy
0F8CKpe4UHc,superficial injuries the guy was literally disarmed hahaha
0F8CKpe4UHc,chris rock was real quick with that joke brilliant way to bring the humor back after that situation
0F8CKpe4UHc,was that will smith
0F8CKpe4UHc,normal person the person was arrested charged and set bailed
0F8CKpe4UHc,security immediately intervened uhno he shouldnt have made it on stage
0F8CKpe4UHc,thank you dave chappell for being there for chris rock thank you busta rhymes and jamie fox for being there for dave chappell love and respect to everyone 
0F8CKpe4UHc,two legends man i wish i was there but ill be damn sure to watch on netflix
0F8CKpe4UHc,thats why you let things play out sometimes chris saw his moment and verbally slapped will back well done
0F8CKpe4UHc,when the guy who attacked has more injuries than the target
0F8CKpe4UHc,jokes of the year go to chris rocktwice in one year
0F8CKpe4UHc,i wouldnt call his arms broken backwards to be superficial injuries
0F8CKpe4UHc,will smith is going to be eating humble pie for years to come
0F8CKpe4UHc,2022 unfortunately i believe this is just the beginning of comedians being attacked on stage  due to a unnecessary persons behavior that was not addressed properly
0F8CKpe4UHc,right place right time the best one liner ever lol
0F8CKpe4UHc,we love chris rock
0F8CKpe4UHc,chris rock was absolutely hilarious it is his time now
0F8CKpe4UHc,chris got the last laugh literally
0F8CKpe4UHc,i hope will can laugh at this even though he probably felt bad about it and embarrassed its gotta be tough with a million eyes on you
0F8CKpe4UHc,what 30000 bail  this man is a danger to society he attacked a man  with a knife gun in front of thousands  hes clearly unstable
0F8CKpe4UHc,dave started chasing him too  then realized he still has a show to dolol
0F8CKpe4UHc,well apparently security wasnt tight enough company should be sued
0F8CKpe4UHc,superficial injuries  they whooped his ass
0F8CKpe4UHc,therell never be another oscars slap without an immediate response
0F8CKpe4UHc,if that was will smith he would have been there til the end of the show lol
0F8CKpe4UHc,chris rock is the man
0F8CKpe4UHc,that mangled arm didnt look superficial to me
0F8CKpe4UHc,not my words but worth repeating
0F8CKpe4UHc,this has to be be literally the shortest joke ever just 2 wordsand a name genius
0F8CKpe4UHc,absolute legends chris rockjamie fox and the awesome dave chapelle thank god no one was seriously hurt but the lunatic
0F8CKpe4UHc,chris rock you are great and kind hearted
0F8CKpe4UHc,this is legendary
0F8CKpe4UHc,well obviously the security wasnt tight enough
0F8CKpe4UHc,dave chappelle man what a g shit didnt even phase him he just starts making more jokes
0F8CKpe4UHc,i bet dude wont run up  attack a comedian again after that ass beating that he got lol chris rock is a boss for that joke
0F8CKpe4UHc,im glad this whole thing turned out to be funny af
0F8CKpe4UHc,chris jamie and dave all awesome human beings much love
0F8CKpe4UHc,if security was sooo tight how did the fool even get on stage
0F8CKpe4UHc,chris is a1 with his jokes
0F8CKpe4UHc,30000 bail and done for assaultyet will smith walked back to his seat  disgusting
0F8CKpe4UHc,will is probably thinking damn the depp trial was taking heat off me and now this shit  has to happen
0F8CKpe4UHc,these two are the best onetwo punch in comedy nowadays pun intended
0F8CKpe4UHc,a guy with daves money should have faster security
0F8CKpe4UHc,with that joke he finally relaxed
0F8CKpe4UHc,i love that joke from chris rock about will smith 
0F8CKpe4UHc,this will stop when the performer actually fights back these people have gone
0F8CKpe4UHc,chris rock slapped back at will smith with that one finally must have been a relief to get that off his chest
0F8CKpe4UHc,chris rock did a lighthearted tasteful comeback
0F8CKpe4UHc,and chris deserves to say what he said i dont blame chris cause will was wrong
0F8CKpe4UHc,superficial did you see that man arm lol they kicked his ass
0F8CKpe4UHc,security failed you can bet dave looking for a new crew
0F8CKpe4UHc,security didnt immediately intervene chapelle went back there and stomped his attackers a in his own words
0F8CKpe4UHc,loved chris joke
0F8CKpe4UHc,good job and awesome joke   go chris
0F8CKpe4UHc,my comedians
0F8CKpe4UHc,love it
0F8CKpe4UHc,was that will smith joke of the year
0F8CKpe4UHc,and this is  just a beginning of  never ending roast about will from chris rock
0F8CKpe4UHc,good one chris good one
0F8CKpe4UHc,i love that chris made that joke perfect
0F8CKpe4UHc,was that will smith
0F8CKpe4UHc,omfg chris rock is powerful man with a excellent sense of humor   to be laughing about will smith situation so earlier
0F8CKpe4UHc,well chris rock had the opportunity and he took it
0F8CKpe4UHc,that arm didnt look like a superficial injury js
0F8CKpe4UHc,props to my man chappelle but extra props to the stage waxer  keeping that stage slick and glossy
0F8CKpe4UHc,i love it im sorry that happened to him blessed he was clumsy guy did come in pretty hard
0F8CKpe4UHc,was that will smith
0F8CKpe4UHc,what a difference in reactions to the attackers
0F8CKpe4UHc,will smith set a standard
0F8CKpe4UHc,this is the domino effect that will smith had caused he normalized violence on performers

_T_UPY5qxb0,hes absolutely right
_T_UPY5qxb0,huge respect to farmers around the world you folks face uncertain situations all the time and then get bullied by large corporations
_T_UPY5qxb0,instead of stockpiling food which creates even more shortages we all need to start growing foods in our yards on our rooftops etc
_T_UPY5qxb0,there is a reason why truckers and farmers have been protesting and warning us they are the smartest hardest working people in society and we should be listening too them
_T_UPY5qxb0,dont panic
_T_UPY5qxb0,something to think about
_T_UPY5qxb0,hi sandy
_T_UPY5qxb0,thank you for showing people what is really going on in the farming industry
_T_UPY5qxb0,thanx for giving the rest of your fellow countrymen and women a heads up we appreciate all the work you do to keep all us fed and we gotchyer backs
_T_UPY5qxb0,farmers are heroes without them and their hard work life would be very difficult they need our help to keep them going
_T_UPY5qxb0,yes maam we are on a slippery slope at our ranch we are going backwards trying to hold onto as many cattle
_T_UPY5qxb0,im blessed that i live out in the county amongst farmers  the amish  i really feel sorry for people living in major cities
_T_UPY5qxb0,sincere citizen journalism is our only hope thanks for getting the actual truth out
_T_UPY5qxb0,and the sad fact is this food shortage is man made as is the fuel issues
_T_UPY5qxb0,i love how she reads and comments like shes reading a bedtime story
_T_UPY5qxb0,adapt 2030 is also a great resource channel hes been spot on appreciated you sharing the farmers voices
_T_UPY5qxb0,people never take things seriously until its to late thanks for the warning im definitely taken this to heart and i just subscribed
_T_UPY5qxb0,we already are short car parts housing materials and fuel for cars  their is no surprise that food will be depressed  thank you brandon and giggles
_T_UPY5qxb0,thank you for sharing this with us
_T_UPY5qxb0,ice age farmer is excellent hes been ahead of the game on all of these issues for the last few years
_T_UPY5qxb0,i got my
_T_UPY5qxb0,thank you so much for making this video i really appreciate you sharing this information with me
_T_UPY5qxb0,layoffs started hard this week wife lost her secondary part time job today they eliminated a bunch of positions she is in cyber security
_T_UPY5qxb0,you should also mention shrinkflation  packaging less product increasing the prices
_T_UPY5qxb0,im glad that this popped up into my feed
_T_UPY5qxb0,the farmer i buy my hay from simply put it this way he said  the government is putting farmers out of business
_T_UPY5qxb0,thats why ive been stocking up for years i knew it would finally happen and it did
_T_UPY5qxb0,they are not even willing to admit we are in a recession yet less admit food shortages
_T_UPY5qxb0,new subscriber here  thanks for this  ive been listening to ice age farmer since 2020 and he has been on top of it   keep preaching sister

wX78iKhInsc,i honestly cant decide if this gentleman should become the head of public education in america or americas next great stand up comedian
wX78iKhInsc,i often watch this ted talk when needing extra encouragement as a home educator may you rest in peace sir ken robinson thank you for sharing your wisdom
wX78iKhInsc,this man made more sense in 20 minutes than a whole committee in years and years of planning and execution
wX78iKhInsc,the sad thing is this was posted 7 years ago and nothing has changed in the school system
wX78iKhInsc,this is why field trips are soooo good they create an atmosphere of curiosity and learning its sad how in high school we get much less
wX78iKhInsc,teacher grade is just a number
wX78iKhInsc,it wasnt until i left school that i discovered how interesting learning can be  including what in school i found tedious
wX78iKhInsc,who is here after learning about his passing
wX78iKhInsc,and that is why i have learnt much more on youtube than in school
wX78iKhInsc,we always remember our best teachers the very ones who encouraged us the most are never forgotten
wX78iKhInsc,i just finished college all these years of schooling have been mostly miserable
wX78iKhInsc,my most favorite teachers were in elementary school because they inspired much more imagination than any other teacher all the way through college
wX78iKhInsc,anyone else watching these through quarantine after releasing what a hold school had over them and just thinking where has my teenagerhood gone
wX78iKhInsc,weve invaded every country we  encountered
wX78iKhInsc,dont make children learn make children want to learn
wX78iKhInsc,i cant believe that was only 19 minutes i could listen to this man talk forever so inspiring
wX78iKhInsc,this is something everyone needs to hear this literally speaks to my soul and inspired me to learn more than anything ever will
wX78iKhInsc,and we are learning so much from him what a legend
wX78iKhInsc,rest in peace sir ken robinson i can only hope that people will continue the ideas you started and so far ill admit that not many have yet
wX78iKhInsc,i have to say that this man is one of the best people ive seen on the internet
wX78iKhInsc,one of the most intellectual speeches i have seen on ted talks  sir ken lays out the fundamental solution to our existing education systems rip
wX78iKhInsc,this guy is incredibly intelligent and incredibly funny at the same time
wX78iKhInsc,this great man passed away in 2020 aged 70 
wX78iKhInsc,being in school currently to become an inclusive elementary teacher this has been one of the best talks ive ever seen
wX78iKhInsc,its funny how when im out of school i want to learn moreits almost as if the school system sucks
wX78iKhInsc,its so depressing that we lost a gem like you sir rip we will dearly miss your presence among all educators alike
wX78iKhInsc,my whole academic life has been so far just studying to pass exams
wX78iKhInsc,the best thing we all learned from school
wX78iKhInsc,he is so good at getting his point across in a light hearted way we all have different ways of learning and acting and all are valuable
wX78iKhInsc,if you sit kids down hour after hour doing lowgrade clerical work dont be surprised if they start to fidget
wX78iKhInsc,simply put this was one of the best ted talks ive seen to date
wX78iKhInsc,this speech is amazing
wX78iKhInsc,children are natural learners its a real achievement to put that particular ability out or to stifle it curiosity is the engine of achievement
wX78iKhInsc,creativity is the engine of achievement is such a powerful statement and my new favorite quote
wX78iKhInsc,teachers should care as much about entertaining the students as what they make them learn to make sure something is indeed learned
wX78iKhInsc,this man is an amazing speaker i love his message but i also thoroughly enjoyed his presentation
wX78iKhInsc,this man deserves a standing ovation
wX78iKhInsc,the scariest part about this talk is that he is essentially lecturing about freedom
wX78iKhInsc,excellent in school i always felt like i was doing things that served no purpose other  than appeasing the adults in my life
wX78iKhInsc,rip sir ken robinson your ted talk and books will continue to inspire the young generation we are forever indebted to you we really lost the gem 
wX78iKhInsc,a fantastic speech hes right the education of testing worn out chinese students it explains one of the greatest puzzles for chinese nowadays who wonder why we always lack creativity
wX78iKhInsc,his speech was incredible
wX78iKhInsc,i have never let my schooling interfere with my education mark twain
wX78iKhInsc,learning is the individuals choice in any ways which they can reach thanks for strong explanation based on your experiences
wX78iKhInsc,meu deus eu no me canso de ouvir e ler o que esse gomes produz ele  o arauto de uma educao que desaliena e produz valor f de carteirinha
wX78iKhInsc,the arts arent important just because they improve math scores
wX78iKhInsc,wow the comment section inovated me almost as much as the ted video itself i truely thank all the wise pieces of advice which people are posting
wX78iKhInsc,he passed away on august
wX78iKhInsc,he is inspiring everyone involved with education should watch this
wX78iKhInsc,loved the talk great presentation bravo thank you sir
wX78iKhInsc,children are suffering from childhood 
wX78iKhInsc,sir ken robinson
wX78iKhInsc,one of the most inspiring talks ive ever seen sums up my schooling in the uk
wX78iKhInsc,thank you sir ken robinson
wX78iKhInsc,sir ken is truly an inspiration for the education systems  he knows it we know it so when will it change
wX78iKhInsc,education is like an industrial process
wX78iKhInsc,this is amazing and every school system in the world should adapt to these ideas
wX78iKhInsc,my school environment were going back to the late 90s and early 00s wasnt really conducive to learning
wX78iKhInsc,i have watched this a number of times i have forwarded it to friends and contacts across a wide range rest in peace
wX78iKhInsc,that was the shortest 19 minutes of my life everything just made so much sense
wX78iKhInsc,ken robinson is fast becoming my hero he voices my exact thoughts regarding education
wX78iKhInsc,i love this talk ive watched it several times  ive just written a book inspired by this talk teaching shakespeare in the age of the algorithm
wX78iKhInsc,rest in peace what a bright mind i hope our leaders thought like that everything from his ideology to his sarcasm is just so clever
wX78iKhInsc,it is so saddening to know about the demise of such a truly educated man
wX78iKhInsc,teaching isnt about the passion on learning anymore its about passing
wX78iKhInsc,we will never stop learning thanks for sharing

zWDJAr6tvkI,khamzat and yan crossing paths like two apex predators in the wild
zWDJAr6tvkI,i just want to thank ufc for that petr and khamzat moment something i never knew i needed but i did mean
zWDJAr6tvkI,love how khamzat was checking yans grappling game
zWDJAr6tvkI,after seeing petr defend a takedown from khamzat at
zWDJAr6tvkI,man ive really grown to like zombie he seems like a good guy hope he puts up a good performance same to burns
zWDJAr6tvkI,this episode was so wholesome had a smile on my face the whole time such inspiring athletes
zWDJAr6tvkI,khamzat wrestles everyone he meets friend foe female everyone
zWDJAr6tvkI,respect to usman and gilbert for being so humble and taking the game so professionally
zWDJAr6tvkI,this is one of those fights where everyone is going to have nerves as soon as the walkouts begin fucking love that feeling man mma is the best
zWDJAr6tvkI,khamzat and petr interaction was awesome real recognize real
zWDJAr6tvkI,tkz basically calling volk a midget made my day
zWDJAr6tvkI,that single leg takedown attempt from the wolfshows you how yan is
zWDJAr6tvkI,khazmat is superstar potential
zWDJAr6tvkI,darren till cornering tom aspinall training with all stars in sweden and attending almost every ufc event in the last year hes living the life
zWDJAr6tvkI,volkanovskis confidence is through the roof you can tell he believes he is the greatest fighter on the roster
zWDJAr6tvkI,that was a wholesome moment between khamzat  yan two beasts sharing a laugh
zWDJAr6tvkI,i have the highest respect for alexander and his ability as a fighter and his career but wouldnt it shake up the division in a good way if zombie wins
zWDJAr6tvkI,im putting my money on alexander the great but still i respect what the zombie is trying to accomplish wanting to open doors for your people is respectable
zWDJAr6tvkI,thank you ufc  for keeping everyone entertained during these ridiculous times
zWDJAr6tvkI,got chills of joy seeing khamzat and petr test each other
zWDJAr6tvkI,hope korean zombie comes out on top humble guy he deserves it
zWDJAr6tvkI,saw burns and usman team up its heart warming and an obvious signs that khamzat is a real deal they both wants to erase
zWDJAr6tvkI,much respect to gilbert burns man a lot of people not respecting him but you gotta give credit where its due
zWDJAr6tvkI,i really hope petr can get back his belt
zWDJAr6tvkI,i love volk and korean zombie both solid dudes but i think everyone knows that there is no way volk is losing this fight
zWDJAr6tvkI,the ufc now stands for ultimate fighting chimaev
zWDJAr6tvkI,i love the way khamzat has consistently hyped himself it paid off
zWDJAr6tvkI,absolutely love this series leading up to the fight it reminds us that these guys are still human
zWDJAr6tvkI,damn no way khamzat just makes burns look easy   i will be very impressed if chimaev jumps all the way up to 2 in the rankings
zWDJAr6tvkI,theres nothing better than the build up to these amazing fight cards this is the best sport in the world
zWDJAr6tvkI,the russian hello is really just a quick wrestling exchange
zWDJAr6tvkI,first time im seeing yan laughing like that
zWDJAr6tvkI,that transition from khamzat to petr was beautiful
zWDJAr6tvkI,these embeddeds are actually shot really well a lot of clever editing dont notice any of it either unless youre lookin for it top notch production
zWDJAr6tvkI,seeing khamzat and yan greet each other threw off some crazy energy two complete savages playing aroundinsane killer energy
zWDJAr6tvkI,i cant wait any longer lets go khamzat
zWDJAr6tvkI,i watched burns getting tkod by hooker live on the prelims never thought he would later become a succesful fighter at welterweight respect to him
zWDJAr6tvkI,although i cant see a way for zombie to beat volk i really hope he shocks the world in this one
zWDJAr6tvkI,the biggest confidence boost you can get before a fight khamzat telling your mates youre ready after checking your take down defense
zWDJAr6tvkI,loved to see yan and khamzat getting fun
zWDJAr6tvkI,omg the ufc does a good job of getting you emotionally invested  as i always say i cant wait for this one
zWDJAr6tvkI,that yan chimaev moment was amazing
zWDJAr6tvkI,petr yan has got so much swagger its unreal everybody gets silent when he speaks has this aura of invincibility
zWDJAr6tvkI,petr yan plus khamzat really be a deadly combination 
zWDJAr6tvkI,you know all the fighters have 0 respect for aljo now just look at how volk greeted him he could not care less about him
zWDJAr6tvkI,id never loved ufc as much as i do right now what an era
zWDJAr6tvkI,never have i been more hyped for a card than this one cant wait
zWDJAr6tvkI,i thought someone was speaking russian im like why didnt they put subtitles then i realized till was talking
zWDJAr6tvkI,legend in the making lets go khamzat
zWDJAr6tvkI,zombie is looking sharp man excited for that fight
zWDJAr6tvkI,nothing like embedded during a big fight week
zWDJAr6tvkI,crazy to see khamzat go for a single leg with phone and water bottle in one hand
zWDJAr6tvkI,these embeddeds have been hitting 273 is going to be a banger
zWDJAr6tvkI,i dont know why  but looking at how calm zombie is i feel he might actually pull off an upset
zWDJAr6tvkI,this is a great card excited to see all these fights play out
zWDJAr6tvkI,yans takedown defence is on point
zWDJAr6tvkI,never seen petr yan laugh this hard
zWDJAr6tvkI,if volk yan khamzat win then all the favorites will have won but im still excited to see how
zWDJAr6tvkI,its nice to see usman and burns still having a good relationship
zWDJAr6tvkI,i like how the fighters actually respect each other thats how it should be rather than being conor or colby
zWDJAr6tvkI,these videos get me hyped lol cant wait to see khamzat dominate burns hopefully
zWDJAr6tvkI,theres nothing more russian that yan and khamzats interaction
zWDJAr6tvkI,khamzat reminds me of that kid in school who started going to the gym before anyone else and would challenge everyone he met to arm wrestle him
zWDJAr6tvkI,i want the zombie to win i know hes the underdog just saying it would be cool
zWDJAr6tvkI,burns has grown on me much respect to him
zWDJAr6tvkI,this is gonna b so awesome cant wait for saturday so much hype so much excitement
zWDJAr6tvkI,80 of my brain is actively listening and watching the video 20 of my brain is appreciating the top notch visual and audio editing in the video
zWDJAr6tvkI,ive waited for khamzat for so long and when he finally has a fight again im gonna miss it
zWDJAr6tvkI,i never thought that i would hear big bang lies in a ufc embedded video lmfao
zWDJAr6tvkI,ufc 273 embedded vlog are seriously the best i love watching this series before ufc 273 on saturday night
zWDJAr6tvkI,usman sending every reinforcement he has left dont be surprised if he starts training w colby
zWDJAr6tvkI,its so cool that gilbert and usman were able to reach friendship again and were able to put that title fight behind them good lads
zWDJAr6tvkI,i like how yan is already taking pictures with the belt even the ufc staff knows he is going to win
zWDJAr6tvkI,that khanzat yan moment was amazing
zWDJAr6tvkI,i wish khamzat a long and healthy career
zWDJAr6tvkI,i have so much respect for gilbert that he decided to take this fight
zWDJAr6tvkI,good luck to all the fighters gotta love khamzat trying for a single leg there lol
zWDJAr6tvkI,khamzat and petr messing around is awesome
zWDJAr6tvkI,lol zombie pulling that old trick on volk with the handshake i love when 2 fighters show respect beforeafter the fight
zWDJAr6tvkI,i love volk but im seeing him at 800 and zombie at 500 no way their skills are that far apart
zWDJAr6tvkI,when there is a weekend without fights there is a massive void in my life

aJScU58tnV8,stop giving airtime to amber we dont care about her lies this is the 2nd night in a row you guys are giving her airtime
aJScU58tnV8,i couldnt imagine johnny depp getting an interview if it were the other way around
aJScU58tnV8,if amber heard wanted to move on she would not be talking to savannah guthrie   please go away amber  your 15 minutes are up
aJScU58tnV8,wow you gave amber heard a lot of time to talk about how she cant take responsibility for her own actions no one cares how she feels anymore
aJScU58tnV8,um you did not have mountains of evidence why is nbc giving her the time of day
aJScU58tnV8,so our power grid cant meet the demands we have now but were supposed to add millions of electric cars across the country
aJScU58tnV8,depp needs to sue amber again and keep doing it until she is embarrassed to speak again amber lost because shes a loser and lied the entire case
aJScU58tnV8,enough of amber heard she lied in court so you give her a place to lie in the public
aJScU58tnV8,amber heard speaks out oneonone
aJScU58tnV8,amber claims she just wanted to move on  so why write the oped or file a case
aJScU58tnV8,lester holt americas greatest journalist
aJScU58tnV8,why arent the oil companies being held accountable for price gouging they are seeing record profits
aJScU58tnV8,amber heard and her team could have asked for a closed trial what i suspect is that they expected public opinion would be on her side they gambled and lost
aJScU58tnV8,amber didnt win her has in the uk as she wasnt a defendant in that case
aJScU58tnV8,wth nbc two days in a row  there are way more important things happening in the world right now than celebrity gossip
aJScU58tnV8,thats an amazing story of the guy taking pictures
aJScU58tnV8,wow he has been taking pictures all my life 26 in a few weeks and man this story feels good
aJScU58tnV8,i always love the last story of each broadcast thanks for highlighting some special people
aJScU58tnV8,wait for gods court amber he knows what happened but remember he knows whos lying and telling the truth
aJScU58tnV8,why does nbc broadcast amber heards pathetic whine   she has learned nothing
aJScU58tnV8,god bless our county we need you now more than ever please help us to help ourselves and others thank you
aJScU58tnV8,loved the last segment
aJScU58tnV8,imagine when more electric cars are out there wow what a stupid idea
aJScU58tnV8,refusing to admit defeat amber heard sounds very familiar
aJScU58tnV8,thank you for sharing this with everyone
aJScU58tnV8,god help us americans are suffering save us thank you for your blessed blessings and give us peace we love you jesus
aJScU58tnV8,seriously amber move onward you lost and nobody cares anymore
aJScU58tnV8,heard needs to drop it
aJScU58tnV8,do some of you honestly think that the court will say no to the great johnny depp 
aJScU58tnV8,weather isnt that much more extreme its always been like this
aJScU58tnV8,i feel like every year the weather just gets worse and worse seems like doomsday is close however humanity will never improve their ways
aJScU58tnV8,with all these terrible unusual weathers year after year why are people still believe global warming is fake
aJScU58tnV8,the photographer is a pr guy ive worked with years back nice guy and really rad farm
aJScU58tnV8,amber heard lying
aJScU58tnV8,why they give heard air for people whos been through sa this irritating to watch even now shes lying
aJScU58tnV8,i can hardly wait for the 3rd installment of the nbc exclusive amber heard trilogy  maybe they can make it a series
aJScU58tnV8,i made in time 
aJScU58tnV8,my ernest prayers for all the affected people there
aJScU58tnV8,so uganda just found 12 trillion worth of gold when do you think the good old us of a is going to give them some democracy lol
aJScU58tnV8,lets see some convictions on the mismanaged pandemic funds
aJScU58tnV8,lester holt is a legendary broadcaster
aJScU58tnV8,may god blessed ukraine
aJScU58tnV8,nbc is always making an example out of a single mom whos struggling when covering inflation if you cant feed em dont breed em
aJScU58tnV8,i wondered why they were covering the trial everynite  they were just trying to promote their primetime interview with amber
aJScU58tnV8,amber regrets squatting on johnnys side of the bed rolling her back and released a fat nasty turd then she had the audacity to blame their dogs
aJScU58tnV8,homeowners in texas should have learnt a lesson and installed their own backup generators
aJScU58tnV8,life could go by    in a smap 
aJScU58tnV8,lester holt rulz
aJScU58tnV8,and about amber guess now she knows gender wise  what it feels like marrying the wrong person for the wrong reasons and motives
aJScU58tnV8,well thats what you get for talking badmaking up lies about my boi johnny depp
aJScU58tnV8,everything is bigger in tx  including bs explanations and excuses
aJScU58tnV8,can someone please explain to me how raising interest rates will combat inflation  seems like thats adding to the problem
aJScU58tnV8,all praise to the almighty
aJScU58tnV8,ambers evidence didnt match her narrative
aJScU58tnV8,merci beaucoup pour vos efforts que dieu vous bnisse abondamment
aJScU58tnV8,you cant say you created millions of jobs people were just returning back to work now people are screwed because of this horrible inflation thats just getting started
aJScU58tnV8,those forests they let burn create the rain clouds needed to prevent forest fires
aJScU58tnV8,i love the picture story
aJScU58tnV8,every time i hear defamation trial my brain automatically corrects it to defecation trial
aJScU58tnV8,excellent broadcast as usual my day is not complete until i watch the evening news with lester
aJScU58tnV8,spring and summer of 2012 big chunk of the us had record heat that started in march and didnt stop until late september
aJScU58tnV8,u just wanted  to move on with your life after u defamed johnny it doesnt work that way
aJScU58tnV8,i take pictures daily too and after my husband passed last year i was grateful that i did 
aJScU58tnV8,amber  says she wants to move on but she never does
aJScU58tnV8,what she deeply regrets  losing the case
aJScU58tnV8,not watching because of the amber heard interview clicking away i refuse to give her any of my time or attention
aJScU58tnV8,imagine making excuses by saying its because of the russia and ukraine war that why gas price are rising high lol
aJScU58tnV8,i think what we can all agree is that the government needs to put more money into expanding the restaurant bojangles to the central and western part of the country
aJScU58tnV8,gop just another typical summer reeee
aJScU58tnV8,wish they could somehow magically scoop up all that xtra water and transport it to the places of
aJScU58tnV8,enough with the amber heard johnny depp news ask yourself would walter cronkite be talking about this
aJScU58tnV8,biden defends his response to the economy i cant with that guy
aJScU58tnV8,all this extreme weather and people want everybody to get an electric vehicle yeah right
aJScU58tnV8,love the last story i think that i will be doing something similar
aJScU58tnV8,we need to do something to fix global warming i live in arizona and by 2050 phoenix az will be unlivable

marnjyqEio0,that was the intent not the effect
marnjyqEio0,i remember taking a thirdyear statistics course that i did pretty well in a decade ago dealt with things like chisquare tests multiple linear regression ttests that sort of thing
marnjyqEio0,that was the intent not the effect
marnjyqEio0,imposter syndrome yes
marnjyqEio0,the best part of school was having parents try to do my math started being easier about test scores after that
marnjyqEio0,buddy this system sounds fairly inefficient
marnjyqEio0,human we are just highly advanced ai
marnjyqEio0,love how it perfectly loops back to human i dont mean to be rude like the alien is even more concerned now
marnjyqEio0,the audacity of the accuracy of this the accuracy
marnjyqEio0,that was the intention not the effect
marnjyqEio0,a praise kink

marnjyqEio0,sometimes i wonder how good i could become at something if school wasnt there to distract me
marnjyqEio0,schooling only gave me imposter syndrome and a praise kink
marnjyqEio0,this threw me for about 10 different curveballs love it
marnjyqEio0,why do you feel the need to call me out like this
marnjyqEio0,praise kink
marnjyqEio0,this video severely sums up my study career
marnjyqEio0,your smart your loyal

marnjyqEio0,felt the end i felt that so hard
marnjyqEio0,that last line led to more introspection than ive experiencedmaybe ever
marnjyqEio0,welp thats enough of the internet for me
marnjyqEio0,i learnt to use those skills in a failed attempt of arson i now know i need certain materials to flash ignition places
marnjyqEio0,wow i umive never thought about it like thatwell that makes me feel a lot better im gonna have a good day tommorow thank you
marnjyqEio0,damn mic drop at the end oof

marnjyqEio0,almost choked on my lunch at the last line he really do be calling out most of a generation
marnjyqEio0,what i got from school was landing on a death list and emotional damage in that order

aqW-8WtYJvw,second time making a semidocumentary do you enjoy these kinds of video style please let me know
aqW-8WtYJvw,as an artist i wanna give some insight into the markets and what i think the effect of this tech is gonna be
aqW-8WtYJvw,the quality of your content is insane and im glad there are channels like yours that cover ai because it doesnt get talked about enough
aqW-8WtYJvw,choose a creative career they said itll be among the last to be automated they said
aqW-8WtYJvw,awesome video may i point out one possible aspect for improvement sometimes the music track is too loud and drowns your voice so its harder to understand you eg
aqW-8WtYJvw,10 years ago artists oh no style transfer ai will take our job
aqW-8WtYJvw,i like so much to use latent majest diffusion because theyre multi modal a thing that you dont have mentioned
aqW-8WtYJvw,incrvel seu video sou brasileiro e gostaria de entrar nesse mundo da arte ai mas me parece uma bolha fechada por enquanto como comear por onde comear obrigado
aqW-8WtYJvw,bycloud  thanks for the video this was way more detailed and interesting that i had expected when i clicked on the thumbnail
aqW-8WtYJvw,my favorite ai channel love your videos i hope you get more recognition
aqW-8WtYJvw,this is the most helpful video about the state of ai today that you will find on the internet thank you so much
aqW-8WtYJvw,the future of entertainment is going to be overwhelmingly amazing
aqW-8WtYJvw,disco diffusion dalle 2 and midjourney were all so impressive
aqW-8WtYJvw,as an artist im so damn scared for the future
aqW-8WtYJvw,midjourney is good managed to refine me solid base art for my cover using just the free trial generations
aqW-8WtYJvw,this is going to put a lot of people out of work just messed with midjourney for hours and its just mind blowing the stuff it creates in mere seconds
aqW-8WtYJvw,thank you so much bycloudthis is so helpful
aqW-8WtYJvw,its crazy how fast this is being developed and improved singularity soon
aqW-8WtYJvw,good video bro just want to point out that the word modal is pronounced like mowdul rather than model they mean very different things
aqW-8WtYJvw,the only advantage big tech has on grassroots independent ai research is their datademocratize the data
aqW-8WtYJvw,now i know why i procrastinated learning art all the time
aqW-8WtYJvw,holy shit amazing content happy to have funded your channel
aqW-8WtYJvw,honestly i wanted ai to generate adult material for my amusement most of the engines are designed to not do that i got banned from a certain servicegroup
aqW-8WtYJvw,great video very informative
aqW-8WtYJvw,um actually theres only one e in dalle
aqW-8WtYJvw,incredible video incredible channel
aqW-8WtYJvw,just wait well have an ai generated movie with ai generated invented actors and actresses in no time at all
aqW-8WtYJvw,amazing video
aqW-8WtYJvw,heavily underrated video
aqW-8WtYJvw,love the video one tip try to normalize the sounds and your speaking voice i was like too loud oh not loud enough ok too loud again
aqW-8WtYJvw,stray cat in dark alley looks for marks in his confidence game while smoking a marlboro
aqW-8WtYJvw,now we only need an open source free version of this
aqW-8WtYJvw,which of these can we use commercially i think dall e2 is not available i
aqW-8WtYJvw,hollow knight music i see ur a cultured man
aqW-8WtYJvw,i can imagine that artists are then needed to paint these ai generated images into real paintings this would a new source of income for them
aqW-8WtYJvw,and now there is googles parti which looks better than both imagen and dalle 2
aqW-8WtYJvw,i saw some captcha images visibly recognizable as made with ai
aqW-8WtYJvw,great work
aqW-8WtYJvw,this channel is underrated
aqW-8WtYJvw,audio seems a little quiet
aqW-8WtYJvw,rip 2d artist 3d is next
aqW-8WtYJvw,stateoftheart ai
aqW-8WtYJvw,this video is so good
aqW-8WtYJvw,where can i find the artist at
aqW-8WtYJvw,dude please remove the grainy sound its annoying with headphones
aqW-8WtYJvw,its not dalle e just dall e
aqW-8WtYJvw,rip detail thanks youtube compression
aqW-8WtYJvw,great vid bro
aqW-8WtYJvw,am i the only one or right after the
aqW-8WtYJvw,hollow knight ost spotted near minute 7 but with different pitch
aqW-8WtYJvw,which software you use
aqW-8WtYJvw,now cover imagen and parti
W4ktLen9cVM,watch part 2 with victor here
W4ktLen9cVM,this guy is exactly what i would expect a mortician to be like calm professional dark sense of humor
W4ktLen9cVM,im convinced this man has been alive for 100s of years and his name just proves it
W4ktLen9cVM,the name victor m sweeney really sounds like a comic book villains name
W4ktLen9cVM,are we all buried with unpooed poo
W4ktLen9cVM,oh god being a mortician sounds like such a mentally scarring job to me im so glad there are people out there willing to do this
W4ktLen9cVM,this man deserves something for making this whole thing interesting and not remotely creepy
W4ktLen9cVM,as a retired fd and embalmer of 44 years this is a good practical presentation answering questions many need to know
W4ktLen9cVM,mad respect for morticians i cant imagine having to deal with dead people everyday
W4ktLen9cVM,if this guy isnt my mortician im not dying
W4ktLen9cVM,the question at
W4ktLen9cVM,ive just realised being a mortician is basically like being a doctor just alot more forgiving
W4ktLen9cVM,i love how excited and interested he is when describing all of his tools and materials his appearance is bringing me joy as well
W4ktLen9cVM,i love how hes referring to dead people like theyre his customers
W4ktLen9cVM,this guy seems like the type of person who could just instantly ease someones grief with his charisma what a wonderful human being
W4ktLen9cVM,future corpse
W4ktLen9cVM,i dont know why but i just love this guy just the way he talks and presents himself seems so likable
W4ktLen9cVM,i like how he talks about the bodies like theyre still alive and getting ready for some sort of convention
W4ktLen9cVM,i love how he is so respectful towards the people he has embalmed
W4ktLen9cVM,he seems like the type of guy to tell the dead body he is working on a joke and then after a couple seconds he says wow tough crowd
W4ktLen9cVM,drop grandma down the hole i love this guy his sense of humor is great
W4ktLen9cVM,note do not pick a fight with a mortician
W4ktLen9cVM,this is quite frightening tbhbut its also important to appreciate these people and what they do and the very important service they provide for the society
W4ktLen9cVM,idk what you all think  but i really appreciate his professional choice of words while having a respectful bit of humor for the questions
W4ktLen9cVM,this guy is a gem get him on a panel show or bbc reality doc series would pay for his self help book not just read it in the aisle
W4ktLen9cVM,he is a real life book character everything about him seems so unreal im glad people like him exist in real life
W4ktLen9cVM,fun blood draining devices
W4ktLen9cVM,informative and entertaining he seems to have a great sense of humor and is well adjusted to his profession too i could see him in a straightman comedic part easily
W4ktLen9cVM,im super curious about his opinion on how autopsies affect the morticians job
W4ktLen9cVM,he speaks of his morticianed people like clients or patients he just seems very respectful of the dead people hes prepared what a rough job amazing that hes so positive
W4ktLen9cVM,victor you and mike do a fantastic job  kudos to you for all you do for the people in and around my hometown
W4ktLen9cVM,this is actually really educational and he puts it out in a way that makes it kind of silly and funny for such a morbid taskjob
W4ktLen9cVM,that was brilliantly interesting  i remember seeing my step mom in her casket at her house she looked so at peace an it felt like she would just wake up
W4ktLen9cVM,wow youre delightfully funny informative lighthearted and yet your reverence for the dead is palpable
W4ktLen9cVM,its such a weird feeling seeing this guy half super chill cool guy half still gives me the creeps
W4ktLen9cVM,ive probably put on more bras than ive taken off
W4ktLen9cVM,i want to be buried by someone like victor calm collected professional not easily embarrassed
W4ktLen9cVM,honesty and respect  hard job done with care youre a good person  and a sense of humor for sanity lol
W4ktLen9cVM,its amazing to know how good these people are at uncommon or lesser known jobs like this
W4ktLen9cVM,i love this guy he needs his own channel fascinating information

W4ktLen9cVM,thank you for this video  it was informative and you have a very good communication style
W4ktLen9cVM,its insane how he answers every question without missing a beat hes so well spoken and professional
W4ktLen9cVM,destin sandlin once said about a urologist this guys either gotta be really boring or really funny i feel like mortician is the same way
W4ktLen9cVM,that swedish chef impression was absolutely spot on and now i want him to sing it at my funeral
W4ktLen9cVM,very likeable young man clearly intelligent and with passion for his craft
W4ktLen9cVM,this guy was born to do this for a living his name his look enthusiasm and smarts hes fascinating
W4ktLen9cVM,yo i love this guy he makes it so a morbid issue doesnt feel as heavy i kinda love it honestly can we somehow have him back
W4ktLen9cVM,excellent choice of mortician thanks for doing this victor
W4ktLen9cVM,morbid topic aside pun intended this was highly informative interesting and quite charming thank you mr sweeney
W4ktLen9cVM,this guy is so charismatic and professional that if he ever becomes a serial killer no one would ever find out because he has the perfect cover
W4ktLen9cVM,i think talking about this is important it takes the fear out of the unknown if you ask your family what you want
W4ktLen9cVM,i was enjoying the video until he said cats are inferior to dogs now thats taking it too far mr sweeney
W4ktLen9cVM,this guy is amazing what a gem
W4ktLen9cVM,this guy was great i wish him the best
W4ktLen9cVM,this guy was meant for tvmovies his persona and voice are so intriguing
W4ktLen9cVM,ive put on more bras than i have taken off this guy is a legend and you cant convince me otherwise
W4ktLen9cVM,im aiming to be a mortician one day and this helps so much i havent been able to find any good videos and i love this
W4ktLen9cVM,im so glad there are people out there willing to do these kinds of jobs
W4ktLen9cVM,omg i love this guy i aspire to be just like him his whole entire demeanor is just charming in every way i wanna be like that
W4ktLen9cVM,gotta say this was very entertaining you have a great sense of humor
W4ktLen9cVM,id honestly woudl do an intership with sweeney mans good at his job enjoys it and explains it really well
W4ktLen9cVM,this is such an awesome video like wow thank you for answering the questions
W4ktLen9cVM,great talent
W4ktLen9cVM,as a person who finds this interesting i enjoy this video gen  as a cat person i am enraged lh
W4ktLen9cVM,i dont think i could be a mortician im a bit squeamish but ive always been fascinated with death and this was very fun for me thank you
W4ktLen9cVM,hes not a psychopath or a sociopath the man just knows what hes talking about its his job
W4ktLen9cVM,morticians are artists with a lot of courage

HoAg1trAfIc,i like that they put a bunch of green stuff on top for aesthetics while the guys are wearing blindfolds
HoAg1trAfIc,how did jamie get so much of the chicken wing sauce over his face
HoAg1trAfIc,somehow wednesdays and sundays never come soon enough but when they do they never disappoint
HoAg1trAfIc,what a lovely day a double dose of sorted today as the team up with tom scott popped up in my feed earlier
HoAg1trAfIc,im so happy that barry gets to take all the premium ingredients home whether hes allowed to or not lol
HoAg1trAfIc,we used to make a pesto that had walnuts and a wee bit of black olive in it  was really good  cashews sound even better
HoAg1trAfIc,im pretty sure the food team makes the food that would be funniest to see someone with a blindfold eat
HoAg1trAfIc,when ben asked whether they could see the color difference of the chili powder did he mean in the plates because the bowls sidebyside were shockingly different hues
HoAg1trAfIc,i would love to see a video in this format but its regular vs free from foods
HoAg1trAfIc,tracklement plural tracklements
HoAg1trAfIc,both jamie and barrys reactions to the cider vinegar made me think i should give that a go and their enthusiasm definitely helped
HoAg1trAfIc,one thing id like to see in this type of series is it really beneficial to fresh grind your own spices or is it ok to buy preground blends
HoAg1trAfIc,sitting down to have dinner whilst watching the boys is honestly one of my favorite parts of the week
HoAg1trAfIc,id love to see a video going over past premiumpretentious ingreditents the normals said they would buy  and which ones each of them actually did buy
HoAg1trAfIc,i love when they guess differently and the justifications they give
HoAg1trAfIc,would love the recipe for those wings they looked amazing
HoAg1trAfIc,i love seeing you guys experience new flavors i also love that by using blindfolds you can see past marketing ploys bravo
HoAg1trAfIc,bazs reaction to being right on the mustard is everything
HoAg1trAfIc,i havent tried traklements mustard but i can say that their piccalilli is outstanding and i wouldnt buy a different brand
HoAg1trAfIc,would love to see the tracklements mustard up against something as classic as colmans
HoAg1trAfIc,id like them to try the difference between cheap jam and expensive the difference is usually quite something especially if it is home made
HoAg1trAfIc,i would have liked to see homemade pesto added to the running
HoAg1trAfIc,always interesting  premium ingredients sometimes have a place if your palate requires it
HoAg1trAfIc,i like these would be good to see a version where the tasters just nominate their favourite dish of the two without knowing the secret ingredient
HoAg1trAfIc,never really thought about the fillers used in mustard plus i dont think i ever realized that mustard was supposed to have more than just a tang
HoAg1trAfIc,love these episodes more please also you should think about having 5 items instead of 4 because odd numbers seem a bit more satisfying
HoAg1trAfIc,the food team is always on point the food looks fantastic
HoAg1trAfIc,greetings from the us i love your channel you are teaching and making me laugh
HoAg1trAfIc,id love to see a comparison to the most popular brands ive tried tracklements and couldnt taste much difference between that and colemans mustard
HoAg1trAfIc,we use tracklement in my pub and they really are a fantastic company their horseradish is just as feisty
HoAg1trAfIc,love how confidently jamie says number b
HoAg1trAfIc,honestly i missed these type of videos the pretentious ingredients and kitchen gadgets and chef vs normal budget videos are my absolute favorite
HoAg1trAfIc,id love to see you guys try dutch balkenbrij and zult head cheese
HoAg1trAfIc,i love these product vs product videos the most i hope you keep doing them
HoAg1trAfIc,thank you for brightening my sunday the moment i saw your notification i knew i would smile and feel happy
HoAg1trAfIc,i love trs ground spices definitely worth buying
HoAg1trAfIc,good little tip for food waste you can sub the basil in pesto for the green carrot tops if you have any laying around pretty tasty too
HoAg1trAfIc,love the format but price per kilo often has less meaning can we get price per jarbottle to see what we would pay for the stuff if we bought it
HoAg1trAfIc,would be fun to see them choose between cheap stuff and try to find the premium
HoAg1trAfIc,super curious to try that mustard donut that sounds super good ngl
HoAg1trAfIc,i love this series it is my favorite mind you i like them all
HoAg1trAfIc,my wallet loves regular store bought ingredients but my pallet prefers premium ingredients  its a battle i want my pallet to win because it loves a good mustard
HoAg1trAfIc,i always buy tracklements mustard i would never buy any other now its amazing
HoAg1trAfIc,i always learn so much with these i am amazed at whats out there
HoAg1trAfIc,you should also compare in price and quality to a homemade version for things like pesto
HoAg1trAfIc,spaff is getting good at this foody stuff at least when hes eating it
HoAg1trAfIc,just finished the video with tom scott another great video as always cheers
HoAg1trAfIc,jamie should get a badge for pine nuts and terrine
HoAg1trAfIc,gotta agree must do chefs blind budget vs premium
HoAg1trAfIc,the best mustard is the one you make with foragedhomegrown mustards
HoAg1trAfIc,im already upset because jamie didnt introduce himself wearing glasses over his blindfold lmao
kCOnNPq5ITA,indias education system lacks 2 things
kCOnNPq5ITA,our education minister seriously need to be educatedcomparing a national level exam with more than 18 lakh applicants with monthly unit examwow india is evolving
kCOnNPq5ITA,i think politicians should give a politics entrance exam in order to become a minister
kCOnNPq5ITA,the way they laugh at our tweets  they are laughing at our tears  we have got such great ministers  such great government
kCOnNPq5ITA,neet ug is not equivalent to monthly exam
kCOnNPq5ITA,our education minister is so tanlented because he compare the national level exam with monthly unit exam
kCOnNPq5ITA,according to him neet is a monthly paper
kCOnNPq5ITA,ahhaaaaeven our gatekeeper of hostel has more awareness of what neet is than our education minister himself excellent
kCOnNPq5ITA,i think our respected education minister doesnt have any idea of meaning of majority
kCOnNPq5ITA,if i cleared neet and completed my mbbs i will definitely love to work in western countries
kCOnNPq5ITA,the fact that we students are more pade likhe than him but still have to beg in front of ministers like him shows how horrible our education system is
kCOnNPq5ITA,money doesnt make education better if the system is rusted
kCOnNPq5ITA,even the maid of our house knows the value of neet over a monthly testhats off to the highly educated  education minister of bjp
kCOnNPq5ITA,neet exam monthly exam as per eduminster
kCOnNPq5ITA,neet is hit or not dont take it as your children unit testsits a lot behind going parents pressurecareer anxiety depressionits not as simple as sayingmodi hai to mumkin hai

kCOnNPq5ITA,politicians and diapers should be changed freuently and all for the same reason
kCOnNPq5ITA,the way he is chilling  laughing on exams shows how much he is concerned 
kCOnNPq5ITA,sir its not a monthly exam for middle class family its hope that came after a year pls sir just one exam is futuring deciding
kCOnNPq5ITA,dharmendra ji just compared neet with monthly school exams and all his chamcha principals laughed yaad rakha jayega
kCOnNPq5ITA,why dont they care about students in assam

kCOnNPq5ITA,look at how he shows his dumbness with a smiling face i need that confidence
kCOnNPq5ITA,greatest educational minister comparing national level exams with unit test in schools
kCOnNPq5ITA,he should be resigned as education minister
kCOnNPq5ITA,how he can compare neet ug and monthly test
kCOnNPq5ITA,we dont need extra time we need more extra seats in medical colleges
kCOnNPq5ITA,students are always anxious
kCOnNPq5ITA,i dont know how to reactbut at the end of this video i came to know that we cry and our ministers laugh at our problems well never forget this
kCOnNPq5ITA,just wow i mean i have no words we were demanding him the whole time woww i have no words
kCOnNPq5ITA,its because his son or daughter has got nothing to worry about his or her future but we general indians have to right
kCOnNPq5ITA,the way our education minister comparing weekly exams with national level exam is not fair
kCOnNPq5ITA,if you cant postpone the neet exam then atleast give us second attempt chance
kCOnNPq5ITA,wow i am seriously disappointed 
kCOnNPq5ITA,the fact that the comments have more likes than this video in whole
kCOnNPq5ITA,what majority education minister is claiming when out of 18 lakh students 223 million tweets about neet postpone are trending on twitter
kCOnNPq5ITA,exam happens every month time agreed
kCOnNPq5ITA,atleast education minister should be some one educated from well known  educational institution
kCOnNPq5ITA,what a sick man our education minister is laughing at problems our youth is facing aspirants are not requesting theyre pleading disgusting im sorry for all 2022 neet aspirants
kCOnNPq5ITA,ramesh pokhriyal was far more educated and better then current edu minister
kCOnNPq5ITA,wow what a smile after destroying thousands of futures
kCOnNPq5ITA,mere teachers thik hi kahte hy
kCOnNPq5ITA,its so hurtful that this man laughs like this on so serious thing
kCOnNPq5ITA,personal advice  please study neet ug wont postpone  the same situation was there for neet pg  but government denied and the exams held on time

kCOnNPq5ITA,desh kaa education galat admi kain pas sop diya
kCOnNPq5ITA,we got the exam notification 3 months back lol this country is a joke
kCOnNPq5ITA,im in doubt this is our education minister really

kCOnNPq5ITA,aise education minister ko hata dena chahiye jo khud ke bare main sochta hai aur students ki parva nahi hai
kCOnNPq5ITA,if any student wil commit suicide under stress then only he is responsible one
LSFX9vrwJf8,cant believe this car is 15 years old makes me feel old
LSFX9vrwJf8,my favorite line ever godspeed captain slow
LSFX9vrwJf8,i love how richard and jeremy always freak out when a car is going real fast but james isnt even screaming
LSFX9vrwJf8,maxing out the bugatti veyron its an experience that you will remember forever
LSFX9vrwJf8,captain slow went over 400 kph
LSFX9vrwJf8,this is topgear at its best
LSFX9vrwJf8,imagine going 350 kmh and your car is shifting a gear up
LSFX9vrwJf8,well realistically james is probably one of the few who will ever take that car to that speed
LSFX9vrwJf8,i drove the agera rs and got it to 285mph
LSFX9vrwJf8,sometimes i feel a bit rebellious and send my toyota camry up to 71mph
LSFX9vrwJf8,267 mph two hundred and sixty seven miles an hour in a road car wow thats astonishing as james says its a concord moment
LSFX9vrwJf8,whos here after the chiron finally broke 300
LSFX9vrwJf8,and it continues a keyword to consider
LSFX9vrwJf8,nothing will ever beat the timeless beauty of veyron magnificent
LSFX9vrwJf8,anyone noticed that captain slow at
LSFX9vrwJf8,even after all these years this vehicle still stands among the best of the best the bugatti veyron ss is a legend that never dies
LSFX9vrwJf8,431kmh  is also the max speed of the shanghai maglev ive been on that and the thought of doing the same speed in a car is quite terrifying
LSFX9vrwJf8,id love to see an unedited video from the drivers point of view what does travelling at 431 kmh look like for a driver
LSFX9vrwJf8,at that speed when you slow down to 200 kmh you feel like youre stopped
LSFX9vrwJf8,so bugatti wont give the stig a veyron but hes allowed to have a supersport
LSFX9vrwJf8,he wears a helmet because that will save your life when you crash at 420 kmh
LSFX9vrwJf8,i am seriously impressed by captain slow he was so normal and relaxed even at that speed this guy is special
LSFX9vrwJf8,this car is not just a car it is an engineering masterpiece
LSFX9vrwJf8,imagine this headline
LSFX9vrwJf8,godspeed captain slow
LSFX9vrwJf8,every country needs a 5 mile straight to  safely max out your cars top speed
LSFX9vrwJf8,hard to believe james may was the fastest person in the world  in a production car for a certain amount of time until the test driver beat him d
LSFX9vrwJf8,even a decade later the veyron is still one of the coolest cars in the world
LSFX9vrwJf8,did he actually look at the camera for a micro second there at 414kmh
LSFX9vrwJf8,what an absolutely amazing machine
LSFX9vrwJf8,this piece is why i love topgear the music and everything just gives me chills
LSFX9vrwJf8,what a feat of engineering
LSFX9vrwJf8,i got my veyron up to 265 on a freeway
LSFX9vrwJf8,i got my vw  polo up to the blistering speed of 105mph last night i cant imagine what it feels like to go 240 mph
LSFX9vrwJf8,i had goosebumps watching this again such a beast of a car
LSFX9vrwJf8,the way in which james and the test driver were holding the steering with one hand shows the level of engineering bugatti has incredible wow
LSFX9vrwJf8,james may really going down in history as one of very few people to have driven a bugatti at top speed twice
LSFX9vrwJf8,id have loved being behind those guardrails and watch a car go past me at 417kmh
LSFX9vrwJf8,regardless of your tastes youve gotta respect this car for its effortless speed
LSFX9vrwJf8,the pinnacle of human engineering i absolutely love this car love it every since i 1st saw it
LSFX9vrwJf8,this is one of the greatest videos in the history of the automobile legendary
LSFX9vrwJf8,id love the drive one like at a normal speed of 80 miles per hour maximum just being in one would be pretty amazing
LSFX9vrwJf8,i cant believe that bugatti gave captain slow the rarest veyron that they had which only had five of the black  orange ones in existance
LSFX9vrwJf8,i cant believe how stable and composed the bugatti is at those speeds
LSFX9vrwJf8,i give james credit it takes some balls driving that fast no matter how advanced the car is
LSFX9vrwJf8,thats mind blowing ive gone 150mph in my mustang cobra but i cant even fathom this
LSFX9vrwJf8,watching this 9 years later when the chiron has hit 304 is just crazy because that was still incredibly fast
LSFX9vrwJf8,captain slow at over 400 kilometers per hour xdd
LSFX9vrwJf8,being karl benzs great grandson i am compelled to tell you that benz motorwagen is quite stable at its top speed of 10 mph
LSFX9vrwJf8,some say hes no longer captain slow
LSFX9vrwJf8,imagine if they let james drive the ssc when it hit 331 mph
LSFX9vrwJf8,all hyper cars should use this track this will really  make high speed records fair
LSFX9vrwJf8,417 kmh is pretty crazy would be nice to try sometime
LSFX9vrwJf8,those flyby are insane
LSFX9vrwJf8,i got my 96  camaro rs up to 124mph fastest ive ever driven i couldnt imagine doubling that
LSFX9vrwJf8,its amazing the acceleration when its already at 200kmh if you launched my car to 200kmh and i floored the accelerator it would actually slow down
LSFX9vrwJf8,its  just insane that a car can accerelate so fast that it is faster than  the sound of light
LSFX9vrwJf8,this is still my favourite super car i know about koenigseggs ans the electric super cars but this seems classic somehow its like a muscle car among super cars
LSFX9vrwJf8,damn this car is a technological masterpiece 267mph is staggering and the car is a luxurious not just a crazy outright super car
LSFX9vrwJf8,i like how the veyron is like a boss lvl in the car scene once you beat that you got another set of challengers
LSFX9vrwJf8,i feel like a badass when i send my station wagon up to 60 mph
LSFX9vrwJf8,absolutely mind blowing call it the grand beetle for all i care but this ss is amazing in its own way
LSFX9vrwJf8,such a marvel of engineering that speed with all the comforts
LSFX9vrwJf8,i always feel like a badass when i max out my mitsubishi colt cabrio at 190 kmh but this is on another level
LSFX9vrwJf8,gotta love the sound of that engine
LSFX9vrwJf8,its ironic at
LSFX9vrwJf8,such an amazing car
LSFX9vrwJf8,today new top gear released chiron sport run and they got to 423 but it was so boring
LSFX9vrwJf8,that bugatti is amazing and the average time from the companys test driver was 267 mph holy crap that is fast
LSFX9vrwJf8,bugatti is really designing the best engineered cars in the world hats off to them
LSFX9vrwJf8,know that feeling when you were speeding and then slowing down and suddenly 80 feels like standing still i wonder if he gets the feeling at 230 compared to 400
LSFX9vrwJf8,i love how after he starts to slow down he takes one hand off the wheel while im yelling you are still going one hundred miles per hour
LSFX9vrwJf8,10 years later veyron is still a beast
LSFX9vrwJf8,epiclove this and james just made it so much betteralong with this ss veyron
LSFX9vrwJf8,the speed at which it flies off the line is insane
LSFX9vrwJf8,phenomenal i envy james may for that honor
LSFX9vrwJf8,was in a high speed chase at 3am  doing 125mph in my accord  dangerous it was so smooth could of went more
LSFX9vrwJf8,wow thats 13 the speed of sound 340 ms speed of sound  1200kmh
LSFX9vrwJf8,still my most favorite episode of all time
LSFX9vrwJf8,this shows us how advanced technology has become and the potential to make even better machines in the future
LSFX9vrwJf8,so imagine driving down the freeway at 65    and this passes you going 200 mph faster
LSFX9vrwJf8,now this ladies and gentlemen is
LSFX9vrwJf8,i felt like a king of the road when sent my x5 48 to like 220230 kmh d

gqEUFZgLw_Y,the microphone on that headset is surprisingly good very compressed but not tinny or boomy like most headset mics wow
gqEUFZgLw_Y,the fact that you can walk into a basic walmart and come home with decent gaming stuff is a solid w in my book especially for more rural towns
gqEUFZgLw_Y,i dont wanna sit on the poo chair while basically crying is my single favorite linus quote from all the years
gqEUFZgLw_Y,i really hope they will be testing that hdmi cable with the cable tester maybe a short
gqEUFZgLw_Y,i thought the monitor was just called the game which i guess i lost now
gqEUFZgLw_Y,it would have been cool if you guys tested the hdmi cables since you have the machines there
gqEUFZgLw_Y,for months my walmart had a whole pallet of those stupid chairs and ive always wondered how bad they were because the stack never got any smaller
gqEUFZgLw_Y,what makes the premium ones premium
gqEUFZgLw_Y,this is what we call great value for a great price
gqEUFZgLw_Y,the onn puns are so on point
gqEUFZgLw_Y,i was so excited by the lower than expected price ranges to see what the pc  pc parts came in at such a shame walmart stopped at peripherals 
gqEUFZgLw_Y,onn brand is a life savior for budget setups walmart did a great job on this brand
gqEUFZgLw_Y,really surprised at how high quality this cheap stuff is nowadays fairly impressive allows more people to be streamers content creators and gamers
gqEUFZgLw_Y,i dont wanna sit on the poop chair is the best thing linus has said all year
gqEUFZgLw_Y,the quality of ltt content is just absurdly good on all fronts thank you ltt team
gqEUFZgLw_Y,thats awesome technology is moving forward and we can have all those nice features costing a lot less cheers to the onn brand providing affordable peripherals that do not suck
gqEUFZgLw_Y,over or under it is amazing how intouch linus is with prices of so many different types of things
gqEUFZgLw_Y,cool video
gqEUFZgLw_Y,i have actually owned the wireless headset for a bit over a year and i have had absolutely 0 issues with it and i love it
gqEUFZgLw_Y,this is actually one of my fav ltt videosand i blame steve for shaming walmart out of gaming pcs lol
gqEUFZgLw_Y,missed opportunity not buying the cheap and premium hdmi cables and not running them through the cable tester
gqEUFZgLw_Y,i personally used a bunch of different monitors purchased the onn 24in 165hz 1080p panel
gqEUFZgLw_Y,seriously appreciate the extra mic testing im glad it got due credit
gqEUFZgLw_Y,i love that brandon is just yelling from across the warehouse in the middle of them recording d
gqEUFZgLw_Y,i have two of those podcast mics and am thoroughly satisfied with their performance
gqEUFZgLw_Y,the table microphone actually sounded pretty good when not clipping
gqEUFZgLw_Y,the premium hdmi cables are 2 feet longer and have a cloth braiding which looks nicer
gqEUFZgLw_Y,ive been waiting on this video for months i work at my local walmart  was hoping linus would review this setup
gqEUFZgLw_Y,i heard the clipping microphones and instantly thought about turning down the microphone volume in windows as thats what i have to do with my audio interface and microphone setup
gqEUFZgLw_Y,that microphone thing actually sounds fairly decent for its price
gqEUFZgLw_Y,id love to see a five below peripheral video this was hilarious to watch
gqEUFZgLw_Y,i bought those speakers today just for the aesthetic and to my surprise they actually sound kind of decent
gqEUFZgLw_Y,nzxt well pay you to make a video
gqEUFZgLw_Y,i actually stream on twitch using the onn podcast mic and its so pretty decent that i dont really wanna consider upgrading until i have a much better sound environment
gqEUFZgLw_Y,ive got a walmart monitor technically viotek and you can buy it other places and honestly for 1080p ips 144hz vesa adjustable 145 aint bad
gqEUFZgLw_Y,the desktop mic is impressively good when properly configured
gqEUFZgLw_Y,tech tip
gqEUFZgLw_Y,cheap crappy computer stuff was 20 when i was a kid
gqEUFZgLw_Y,for a very simple video i really enjoy this video the guys on set did a great job
gqEUFZgLw_Y,i just tried this method and it really works perfectly for me thank you
gqEUFZgLw_Y,the podcast mic was 85 usable and definitely an option for someone who is just starting out on a mega tight budget
gqEUFZgLw_Y,im amazed at how decent everything was
gqEUFZgLw_Y,this was a top tier video entertaining simple affordable products 1010
gqEUFZgLw_Y,its just me or ltt its like the dream workplace everyone seems to like what they do most of the time
gqEUFZgLw_Y,its really cool that stuff that is at least decentish can be had on the cheap these days
gqEUFZgLw_Y,im glad they tweaked about with the mics a bit hopefully itll convince people that the blue yeti isnt worth the hype technique  the mic itself
gqEUFZgLw_Y,i bought the onn blue tooth head phones on clearance for 5 and they work great battery lasts 12 hours which is more then enough for me
gqEUFZgLw_Y,i bought my pc from walmart along with keyboard mouse monitor been going strong for over a year with no issues total setup cost around 900
gqEUFZgLw_Y,ive actually used a decent bit of onns stuff such as monitor and speakers and yeah theyre actually not bad at all and pretty cheap
gqEUFZgLw_Y,for the mouspad its definitely just a whitelabel product think they sell it for almost half that at action europe
gqEUFZgLw_Y,i was very impressed when the mic sound was adjusted in windows that difference is huge
gqEUFZgLw_Y,i was enjoying watching linus play guess the price of the item until he didnt guess with the wireless charging lamp
gqEUFZgLw_Y,30 folding table from canadian tire i used a swedish wooden dining table for years so the change for me was seamless and unmatched in terms of mobility

gqEUFZgLw_Y,im actually very impressed by that podcast mic actually sounded decent for being so cheap
gqEUFZgLw_Y,i love how everyone saw the reaction of smelling the chair but everyone wanted a whiff just to make sure

ES-kWa21bhk,i was there watching that game in the first clip such a great atmosphere and everyone went wild when that went in
ES-kWa21bhk,as a swimmer myself  this was very informative
ES-kWa21bhk,i like how djokovic still lost that point according to rules
ES-kWa21bhk,el deporte es un arte de habilidad y suerte
ES-kWa21bhk,came for the thumbnail stayed for the rare moments
ES-kWa21bhk,the craziest thing about the rubix cube clip imo is that the two people competing are twins and the time ended up being that close between them mad

ES-kWa21bhk,man i though the first clip was the amazing save and then there was an equally amazing goal
ES-kWa21bhk,dude that caught the ball in his pocket

ES-kWa21bhk,did djokovic still have his balls after that catch
ES-kWa21bhk,the commentator in the hockey one said he did the same move in the shl earlier in the year so obviously not 1 in a million
ES-kWa21bhk,djokovic no 1
ES-kWa21bhk,the rubrics cude one the person that lost actually won his time was behind like 120 milliseconds and face that he got it 1 milsecond after is unbelievably fast

nZTpIXXCIYQ,watch all new episodes of ancient aliens fridays at 98c and stay up to date on all of your favorite the history channel shows at
nZTpIXXCIYQ,indiana jones covered this awesome historical treasure perfectly
nZTpIXXCIYQ,ancient aliens will make it to season 30 and aliens will still be a mystery
nZTpIXXCIYQ,phenomenal i love ancient aliens and the fact that robert clotworthy does such an amazing job narrating this important information
nZTpIXXCIYQ,i think its a frequency oscillator powered by nuclear energy or some kind of antimatter reactor as nikola tesla said that everything has a frequecy
nZTpIXXCIYQ,mysterious the ark of the covenant would not have been so mysterious had we done this in person everyone would have seen but now you all have to believe
nZTpIXXCIYQ,narrator ancient alien theorists say yes
nZTpIXXCIYQ,the arc was supposedly in ethiopia being guarded by an elite group of priests but was stolen a few years ago
nZTpIXXCIYQ,it sounds like it was radioactive as well as a form of communicating device
nZTpIXXCIYQ,ever think that the gold covering the ark was meant to block radiation
nZTpIXXCIYQ,great video and information 
nZTpIXXCIYQ,most it have to be alien or technology cant you just acknowledge the impossible possibility of a spiritual entity
nZTpIXXCIYQ,in order to manipulate or enter contact with the arc does it require to be in a purified or elevated state
nZTpIXXCIYQ,the angels on top of the ark look nothing at all like what humans imagine  today 
nZTpIXXCIYQ,something that cant be explained in history slaps alien on it
nZTpIXXCIYQ,interesting documentary about the ark of the covenant
nZTpIXXCIYQ,youll never know that at all without the artifact itself
nZTpIXXCIYQ,i think its in antarctica the first ever sacred golden box used to speak to the gods
nZTpIXXCIYQ,could it be some type of radioactive or nuclear battery or device with metaphysical properties or some kind of means of interdimensional contact
nZTpIXXCIYQ,really  the ark of the covenant iswas alien technology
nZTpIXXCIYQ,secret weapon of usa
nZTpIXXCIYQ,revelation 1119  tells exactly where the ark is jeremiah 316 approximate time it left the temple
nZTpIXXCIYQ,well this ark really seems like an advanced technology machine
nZTpIXXCIYQ,only if you knew what was inside the first weapon to be brought to
nZTpIXXCIYQ,love your bible history videos
nZTpIXXCIYQ,according to other ancient alien proof it was nuclear waste  atomic power is the power of destruction but also creation
nZTpIXXCIYQ,it is a transmitter that transmits thought waves from human and other animal brains to the arks manufacturers up there
nZTpIXXCIYQ,and how on earth would they know that ffs they dont even know its actual location
nZTpIXXCIYQ,i must have created the word god it just resonates with me personally
nZTpIXXCIYQ,the ark was probably the cause of the explosion at mohenjo daro
nZTpIXXCIYQ,no it doesnt it contains evidence of what aliens really are
nZTpIXXCIYQ,its not technology  but the ark is sacred
nZTpIXXCIYQ,the history channel where the truth is history
nZTpIXXCIYQ,yet gd never even uttered a name called jesus but the details he mentioned about the ark about the leaven bread isnt it ironic
nZTpIXXCIYQ,holding the radioactive crystals that powered the great pyramid 
nZTpIXXCIYQ,the history channel really does a disservice to real history
nZTpIXXCIYQ,i remember when history used to have professional and rigorous content this is just sad
nZTpIXXCIYQ,the arc not only split between rivers but split the red sea because they took it from the pyramids thats why pharaoh was chasing after them
nZTpIXXCIYQ,lol yeah people got sick from a nuclear weapon being carried around in a gold plated wooden box
nZTpIXXCIYQ,i watched a program that said the arc was like a motor with electrical conduit or something to that effect
nZTpIXXCIYQ,if i were moses i would certainly ask god you were able to create the universe and you want me to build this
nZTpIXXCIYQ,what could be more precious than an empty box
nZTpIXXCIYQ,the ark is really nothing but a giant capacitor or a regular dc battery
nZTpIXXCIYQ,depends on your understanding of revelation 119  personally i think its in heaven
nZTpIXXCIYQ,very informative
nZTpIXXCIYQ,for some reason i cant rap my head around the arc even existed at all
nZTpIXXCIYQ,the ark looks like japanese  mikoshi which is thought to be very sacred
nZTpIXXCIYQ,a universe inside a box
nZTpIXXCIYQ,in season 13 of aa they said the arch is in winnipeg in the mcphillips casino  main floor second washroom on the right
nZTpIXXCIYQ,we only know a drip in the ocean of history
nZTpIXXCIYQ,if it should be carried with poles
nZTpIXXCIYQ,they found it with lots of treasures diamonds and gold in the pyramid
nZTpIXXCIYQ,sounds like radiation  i dont suppose its a power supply from a flying saucer
nZTpIXXCIYQ,i believe this should be in india been protected by sivas pramadhaganas
nZTpIXXCIYQ,what if it was an scp
nZTpIXXCIYQ,heres a real question has anyone ever tried to rebuild or recreate the ark what happened
nZTpIXXCIYQ,there in the middle of nowhere and they find all these rear materials and gold to build it and the talent to make it so ornate thats a stretch
nZTpIXXCIYQ,no its called the supernatural power of god almighty
nZTpIXXCIYQ,i love ancient aliens
nZTpIXXCIYQ,the arch is also pandoras box
nZTpIXXCIYQ,i wonder since they have they have exact instructions on building one at their fingertips what happened when they did you know they did so
nZTpIXXCIYQ,the day the ark is discovered and used christianity ends automatically rome is happy as long as it remains hidden
nZTpIXXCIYQ,the aliens that crashed at roswell told the americans where it was and it is now in area 51 that is why the security is so great
nZTpIXXCIYQ,blue dragons truth
nZTpIXXCIYQ,may be the isralites stole it from the egyptians for the theory to be little more true
nZTpIXXCIYQ,the ark of the covenant is no longer on earth its already in heaven revelation 1119
nZTpIXXCIYQ,a holy person needs gold nobody else can touch how unique
nZTpIXXCIYQ,tigray peoples northern ethiopia are hebrew israelite to through genetically historically  kingship the arc of covenants is giving to tigray population as symbol as second chosen children of god
nZTpIXXCIYQ,so could the ark be the power source for the earths lay lines
nZTpIXXCIYQ,meteorite rock found back then and as easy as that 
nZTpIXXCIYQ,if you want to watch a real video of the ark and not this blasphemy look up ron wyatt he also found noahs ark

Xw_WLSnBE8o,i remember watching all the tweets happening in real life and someone said something like bussy is gonna have a field day with this and here we are lol
Xw_WLSnBE8o,i am screaming that this all stemmed from derrick being polite and professional this drama has been a pride month blessing jfc they went in
Xw_WLSnBE8o,the hot or rot videos are essential to my living but nothing makes me drop everything faster than a bussy tea video
Xw_WLSnBE8o,india trying to be the victim is so damn funny like how you gonna start shit and then try and play the victim makes no damn sensewtf
Xw_WLSnBE8o,i chose to stan derrick back when she was the 100th queen to enter the werk room back in 2016 and i havent looked back on this decision ever since
Xw_WLSnBE8o,i also love that she was blaming everybody but bob who made the joke in the first place
Xw_WLSnBE8o,also i really enjoyed the drag race espana ruview with alexis mateo and choriza may they did it really well
Xw_WLSnBE8o,damn indias man used a whole lotta words to say nothing
Xw_WLSnBE8o,india blocked me for liking the tweets dragging her i admittedly forgot she existed until the drama crossed my tl
Xw_WLSnBE8o,bussy failing to remain unbiased while reading the tweets shading india farrah is making me howl
Xw_WLSnBE8o,honestly the this is why derek dont like you line was one of the funniest parts of the pit stop
Xw_WLSnBE8o,i definitely think the fandom went too far with violet i think some people need to learn that not everyone likes what you like and thats okay
Xw_WLSnBE8o,im so grateful india took some time from her super busy schedule to watch derrick in the pit stop and give us all this unintentional comedy
Xw_WLSnBE8o,imagine only being known for being that one drag queen who was picked up during a lip sync and calling others untalented
Xw_WLSnBE8o,india really came out with an attack over a nothing joke between bob and derrick and then got mad when she got dragged for it
Xw_WLSnBE8o,she also quit drag at one point
Xw_WLSnBE8o,an important part of growing from your mistakes is not getting incredibly defensive when anyone vaguely mentions them
Xw_WLSnBE8o,oh my god she was literally brought up as a throwaway joke  drag race reference by bob
Xw_WLSnBE8o,wow im shook violet cares so much i love hearing her opinions and i agreed with 100 of her boots there have been a lot of boots this season
Xw_WLSnBE8o,as soon as i saw that tweet saying youre gunna have a field day with this i knew i was in for a treat
Xw_WLSnBE8o,lets be real  violet on fpr was too much of a good evil thing she was camp on the show with trixie but it just got to be too much
Xw_WLSnBE8o,nope apparently it sells popcorn at music festivals and calls it her booked and busy gigs jaw on the floor i fucking love jiggly
Xw_WLSnBE8o,i would love to see you on a season youre so entertaining to watch but that contract tho
Xw_WLSnBE8o,biting into the india ferrah feud i see what you did girl and thanks i hate it
Xw_WLSnBE8o,as soon as i saw that twitter thread i said to myself ohhh bussy got some hot tea today girl
Xw_WLSnBE8o,busy i love you thanks for keeping us posted on all the juicy drama
Xw_WLSnBE8o,derrick cant help herself but make us all stan
Xw_WLSnBE8o,hey bussy queen  thank you so much for providing us with continued drag race and queer content that is positive fun informative yet
Xw_WLSnBE8o,the way derrick tweets and uses those hashtags is the art sasha velour was talking about
Xw_WLSnBE8o,honestly i blame bobs messy ass he be causing everything and jumping out of it i love him
Xw_WLSnBE8o,this shameful bullyingi am so over it thanks for always being civil about it bussy
Xw_WLSnBE8o,the dr fans always asking for drama and when a queen lets them have it suddenly they cant take it  miss violet is perfect for fpr
Xw_WLSnBE8o,oh its a bussy upload pause life for a moment and giggle time
Xw_WLSnBE8o,i love the minding my own damn business hashtag india made despite the fact that she still kept tabs as to what people were saying about her
Xw_WLSnBE8o,hello bussy queen its always a pleasure watching your video today  its another dramafilled time before i get ready to work thank you for your wonderfully entertaining content
Xw_WLSnBE8o,the moment this happened i immediately thought bussy is going to be eating good with this content
Xw_WLSnBE8o,coco saying sorry dont know who that is flashing across the screen as you dramatically read indias insta post
Xw_WLSnBE8o,derrick barry is too iconic for that read i cant stop laughing
Xw_WLSnBE8o,these more chill videos are so good love less formulaic
Xw_WLSnBE8o,really all india had to do was acknowledge the ill timed choice of words and explain what she really meant thats literally it
Xw_WLSnBE8o,when you laughed into a cough at that plaque pic i died lmao that was by far the biggest burn tweet of all time
Xw_WLSnBE8o,reddit has been burning the past week i live for the drama
Xw_WLSnBE8o,that photo of india was ill
Xw_WLSnBE8o,we adore you bussy  made me chuckle with the salute and mocking bird theme
Xw_WLSnBE8o,playing the race card not then being outwardly being racist
Xw_WLSnBE8o,i love you  u literally take no breaks  i respect the hard work
Xw_WLSnBE8o,bussyqueen love this look giving me life thanks for the t as always
Xw_WLSnBE8o,imagine saying no and just booting someone out of twitter the power of derrick
Xw_WLSnBE8o,shae can never winhas the possibility to win a second title
Xw_WLSnBE8o,thank you for shining truth tea on the fashion photo ruview situation toxic fans need that called out post gurl
Xw_WLSnBE8o,im happy to see india has someone loved by someone

BRn0PzT3KDA,i was going to get this car but i decided to stick with my 1981 ford festiva sport its a pretty bitching ride
BRn0PzT3KDA,stunning man my favorite suv
BRn0PzT3KDA,im going to trade in my 2015 ford fusion for this beautiful vehicle
BRn0PzT3KDA,i like the red power wagon in the background  great review as always thank you
BRn0PzT3KDA,some supercharged goodness
BRn0PzT3KDA,you know range rover went all out when they include forgiano wheelsthe gucci brand of wheels
BRn0PzT3KDA,i have no idea if its worth it but id look good in one while i figure it out
BRn0PzT3KDA,so are they selling the new range rover as a 2023 or are they concurrently selling the old model svr with the new model nonsvrs
BRn0PzT3KDA,looks fast just sitting still
BRn0PzT3KDA,love the color black top with black wheels is a show stopper beautiful
BRn0PzT3KDA,range rover sport is one of my dream car i want one they a super nice vehicles whats your opinion about them
BRn0PzT3KDA,the mecanics bills for this brand is in another level

BRn0PzT3KDA,will be getting the 23 rr sport in 13 months cant wait
BRn0PzT3KDA,it may be born in england
BRn0PzT3KDA,people who buy these dont worry about crazy gas prices legendary
BRn0PzT3KDA,seems like short cuts on a lot of the interior quality for 141k too many zonks for 141k
BRn0PzT3KDA,i dont know what it is about land rover and jaguar  they make beautiful cars with unparalleled interiors but damn their reliability even in the 21st century is horrible
BRn0PzT3KDA,those screens have the response time of a drunk very laggy for 150k hard pass
BRn0PzT3KDA,i cant believe they got rid of the split tail gate on the range rover
BRn0PzT3KDA,this one was just renewed and looks even better hope you can get your hands in a 2023 model asap
BRn0PzT3KDA,sadly this is something i not only cannot afford but 99 of the people on this planet cant either
BRn0PzT3KDA,awesome vehicle however the vehicle is mostly overengineered for practical purposes
BRn0PzT3KDA,some drilled and slotted rotors would be nice on a performance suv that costs 140k
BRn0PzT3KDA,traded my supercharged range rover for a trackhawk trackhawk feels just as luxurious if you have the upgraded interior
BRn0PzT3KDA,it better do that for 140000
BRn0PzT3KDA,huge zonk for reliability im not expecting toyota reliability but landrange rovers isnt known for being very reliable not easy to work on
BRn0PzT3KDA,my favourite
BRn0PzT3KDA,wow thats awesome thank you almighty god for blessing me and showing me that i will buy one for myself
BRn0PzT3KDA,my dream ride could never afford it
BRn0PzT3KDA,this suv def made my twinkie buss cream
BRn0PzT3KDA,very nice but i prefer the defender much more
BRn0PzT3KDA,id like to see the color on a acura rdx   possibly with a type s
BRn0PzT3KDA,i dunno i feel im too ugly to drive it
BRn0PzT3KDA,wow love this
BRn0PzT3KDA,owned by tata india nice review
BRn0PzT3KDA,amazing  suv
BRn0PzT3KDA,a true almighty suv
BRn0PzT3KDA,when the ac control screen is larger than the infotainment screen someone either didnt listen to their customers or are not paying attention

eLeYCwv0j9Q,i love teriyaki mcburger
eLeYCwv0j9Q,welcome to the food wars family george you crushed it cant wait to see the rest of the series and dont worry guys im not gone forever
eLeYCwv0j9Q,japanese sauces need to be a world wide thing that looks so much easier than squeezing
eLeYCwv0j9Q,the way he dispenses the japanese sauces one handed is incredible
eLeYCwv0j9Q,the japanese packaging is cute im also surprised mcfloats arent a thing here but the ice cream machines are always down so maybe thats a factor
eLeYCwv0j9Q,also who thinks they should send me to tokyo to try the exclusives irl thatd be a good series right
eLeYCwv0j9Q,as a former mcdonalds employee a few things to note i worked in a mcdonalds in oklahoma
eLeYCwv0j9Q,okay lets take a moment to appreciate japanese mcdonalds packaging design so cute
eLeYCwv0j9Q,the thing i took from this is japan has really neat condiment containers that i wish we had in america
eLeYCwv0j9Q,lets just take a minute to appreciate george for being a new cohost
eLeYCwv0j9Q,funny to see a teriakyi burger i cant have tomatoes due to gerd and other issues so i tried to find a replacement to sauce my burgers with
eLeYCwv0j9Q,as a canadian i laughed so hard when they called syrup canadian salsa
eLeYCwv0j9Q,mcdonalds should have a poll for each restaurant every couple months to import menu items from around the world it would be very refreshing
eLeYCwv0j9Q,a lot of the menu items in japanese mcdonalds change frequently because theyre always trying new things short term innovative novelty items sell well in japan
eLeYCwv0j9Q,the japanese saucepackaging is awesome this is probably the coolest thing ive ever seen at mcdonalds
eLeYCwv0j9Q,ive only known george for 22 minutes but hes too precious
eLeYCwv0j9Q,dude this is so funny xd loved this war the best thing here in japan are those limited menus the love to make new things lol
eLeYCwv0j9Q,ive only seen george for like 22 minutes and im already in love cant wait to see more of him can we do a uk vs japan vs us
eLeYCwv0j9Q,those pop open sauce packets are hands down the most hi tech sauce packets ive ever seen
eLeYCwv0j9Q,i always order any combo from there as supersized its finally getting to a time when the younger employees dont know what you are talking about
eLeYCwv0j9Q,man that melon mcflaot is something i cant wait to try someday
eLeYCwv0j9Q,yes the quarter pounder exists outside of the us in spain they have their cuarto de libra which is exactly the same burger
eLeYCwv0j9Q,ive heard the quality of the food is much better at japanese mcdonalds also heard theyre seasoned differently also
eLeYCwv0j9Q,coming from someone living in  both
eLeYCwv0j9Q,so glad i found this series today so entertaining
eLeYCwv0j9Q,im a part timer at mcdonalds here in japanand im proud of the quality in japans mcdonalds love from indonesia
eLeYCwv0j9Q,love the whole mcdonald japanese seems so tasty
eLeYCwv0j9Q,while i miss harry george is clearly amazing and we must protect him at all costs welcome george  im looking forward to the new season
eLeYCwv0j9Q,id like to see a comparison of all the restaurants that are countryexclusive and not international
eLeYCwv0j9Q,as someone who used to manage a small mcdonalds watching this video made me physically ill when they were eating the food  japanese mcdonalds packaging is cute though
eLeYCwv0j9Q,i hope someone makes a video of salary comparison of these fast food restaurant workers around the world including all the benefits cost of living and their usual monthly expenses
eLeYCwv0j9Q,australia feels like a weird mixture of both we have floats etc but we seem closer to the american menu
eLeYCwv0j9Q,george is the wholesome vibe we all need right now
eLeYCwv0j9Q,we do have the quarter pounder with cheese in canada i love the sauce containers in japan so cool
eLeYCwv0j9Q,george is a fantastic addition to the series we finally have a country that can stand up with the usa for its exclusives
eLeYCwv0j9Q,everyone all take a moment and just clap for the mcdonalds in japan because of there dedication to the packing design its so good
eLeYCwv0j9Q,im australian and i can tell you quarter pounders are pretty famous and loved in australia
eLeYCwv0j9Q,weird the only mcflurrys available in the south  midwest where ive been anyway is oreo which is by far the better flavor years ago we could get either
eLeYCwv0j9Q,fanta melon soda is the second greatest soft drink on earth after irn bru they taste very similar and impossible to find outside japan 
eLeYCwv0j9Q,that jam package at
eLeYCwv0j9Q,george is instantly likeable so glad hell be on this season
eLeYCwv0j9Q,easy snap  mess free that sauce  jam packaging is just genius  mcd us need to start giving us that
eLeYCwv0j9Q,having the opportunity to experience both i ultimately prefer japans mcd menu and taste my opinion has nothing to do with variety differences
eLeYCwv0j9Q,is nobody gonna talk about how cool that triple berry sauce container was
eLeYCwv0j9Q,i love the spicy chicken sandwich in japan  im gonna miss japanese mcdonalds
eLeYCwv0j9Q,when i was in the marine corp stationed in okinawa and japan i always remember mcdonalds putting there salt and pepper in the same packet i liked it
eLeYCwv0j9Q,excellent selection for a japanese host george is a wonderful counterpart to joe looking forward to the rest of the season
eLeYCwv0j9Q,i really like those japanese sauce containers that crack open when you squeeze them
eLeYCwv0j9Q,i would rather eat mcdonalds in any other country than us george is adorable and has such personality
eLeYCwv0j9Q,i bet the ice cream machine in japan never breaks down
eLeYCwv0j9Q,as someone whove eaten mcdonalds in both japan and us i can say that japanese mcdonalds is the best us mcdonalds tastes like a im in a warehouse
eLeYCwv0j9Q,we have got 2 versions of qp in sweden   regular and dubbel
eLeYCwv0j9Q,should definitely do a series with us vs aus as we have a lot of the same chains with quite a few differences
eLeYCwv0j9Q,welcome george japans mcdonalds food looks good so much more variety and unique flavors 
eLeYCwv0j9Q,i tried the prawn burger when i was in japan love it
eLeYCwv0j9Q,i like how george was opening the sauces like why did i never think of this life hack
eLeYCwv0j9Q,dont know if this has been mentioned  the quater pounder is available in australia with variations including the double and triple quater pounder
eLeYCwv0j9Q,fanta grape is sooooo good that was one of my favorite things to drink in japan
eLeYCwv0j9Q,loving the start to this season george has great screen presence
eLeYCwv0j9Q,i love the japanese sauce packets what a great idea mc donalds you should do this every where
eLeYCwv0j9Q,i love gratin croquette burger of japanese macdonald and the tsukimi burger my american friend hated them though
eLeYCwv0j9Q,props to the editor for the canadian salsa syrup excellent p
eLeYCwv0j9Q,my husband introduced me to chocolate ice cream and 7 up its surprisingly good the mcfloat made me think of that
eLeYCwv0j9Q,the japanese food in this season will crush the american foods
eLeYCwv0j9Q,we have the quarter pounderburger in sweden i think it always has been on the menu
UYxMSqq7azc,freedom isnt free if you want peace prepare for war two powerful and true quotes that give me goose bumps
UYxMSqq7azc,in times of peace prepare for war this quote rings true at this very moment
UYxMSqq7azc,in times of war we fight for peace in times of peace we prepared for war
UYxMSqq7azc,those who desire peace must prepare for war plato he also stated only the dead see the end of war   greg withrow
UYxMSqq7azc,the current saying of the century reads as follows
UYxMSqq7azc,the most important thing that everyone should remember is that
UYxMSqq7azc,the jeep was an antique by the early 70s a 30 year longevity the humvee is still on the frontline even after 40 years of service crazy
UYxMSqq7azc,the united states welcomes and recognizes a new free and democratic russia
UYxMSqq7azc,keir has a great dramatically appropriate voice for such reports i almost feel that hell announce the launch of nukes at any moment it is a very serious subject respect
UYxMSqq7azc,we are trying to guide people to think with their own head
UYxMSqq7azc,the quote is actually in times of peace prepare for war
UYxMSqq7azc,its scary how the momentum for war can become unstoppable
UYxMSqq7azc,i know not with what weapons world war iii will be fought with but world war iv would be fought with sticks and stones albert einstein
UYxMSqq7azc,keirs simmons my favourite journalist very brave in confrontation with any powerful world leaders keep it up
UYxMSqq7azc,is this a fight for democracy  this isnt a fight for democracy  this is a fight for survival
UYxMSqq7azc,god bless nato ukraine  the russian people peace  freedom
UYxMSqq7azc,technically hes not lying nato has always been an offensive alliance so he is definitely not wrong
UYxMSqq7azc,prayers for russia
UYxMSqq7azc,i want to die peacefully in my sleep like my grandfather not screaming n yelling like the passengers in his car
UYxMSqq7azc,were guiding people to think with their own head  perfectly worded 
UYxMSqq7azc,nato was weak unorganized not really that cooperative and almost nonexistent on the eastern front but russia decided to change that
UYxMSqq7azc,alhamdulillah rusian and ukraine peace aameen
UYxMSqq7azc,if you want peace prepare for war thats deep
UYxMSqq7azc,remember russia trying or invading finland couple times before then russia tried to invade afghanistan russia invaded crimea russia invaded georgia russia invaded crimea
UYxMSqq7azc,interesting news coverage  very informative
UYxMSqq7azc,cooperation cannot happen with an unwilling partner  i would like to see peace and cooperation with russia down the line but not with the current attitudes
UYxMSqq7azc,if you want peace expect war
UYxMSqq7azc,wonderful blessings to all
UYxMSqq7azc,i honestly cant stand looking at or listening to any russian representative now they seriously turn my stomach with their continuous deceit it is truly sickening
UYxMSqq7azc,freedom isnt free when there are plenty of evil dictators in the world out to ruin your day 
UYxMSqq7azc,the newsmen act like theyre covering a football match can they just be serious when were discussing this horrific situation
UYxMSqq7azc,they should do this later kinda conflicts with my schedule rn
UYxMSqq7azc,these artists and curators must be under an enormous amount of pressure so much so theyve given away what the artist prizes most creative integrity
UYxMSqq7azc,wasnt a russian justification for war that ukraine had the power to attack them and would attack yet they are depending of nato to defend themselves
UYxMSqq7azc,i never imagined the potential of experiencing a world war aka nuclear war in my life time
UYxMSqq7azc,please let peace prevail both sides must come together and talk and work out a peace deal our world cannot afford another world war
UYxMSqq7azc,yes  good weapons many of themgreat strategy many counters and if needed moore fronts for russia
UYxMSqq7azc,we need to fight our government and get our country back theres just a lot going on
UYxMSqq7azc,good report  very interested in what nato ultimately conceded to turkey it couldnt have been insignificant given erdogans posture against finland and sweden
UYxMSqq7azc,i prefer dangerous freedom over peaceful slavery
UYxMSqq7azc,dont forget to support your local farmers  we all need help  large and small
UYxMSqq7azc,always pointing at other groups but history have shown that theyre the most violent bloodthirsty creatures smh
UYxMSqq7azc,necessity is the plea for every infringement of human freedom it is the argument of tyrants it is the creed of slaves
UYxMSqq7azc,this needed to happen months ago should of sent a extra 150k soliders on vacation in europe as soon as they pushed to kiev
UYxMSqq7azc,good to see all the historic quotes taken out of context and submitted in the comments real original stuff
UYxMSqq7azc,russia invaded ukraine and theyre calling nato an offensive organization typical kremlin narative
UYxMSqq7azc,as the starks always said winter is coming and europe doesnt have a energy plan for the next 7 years
UYxMSqq7azc,if you want peace
UYxMSqq7azc,these leaders know ww3 has started  40k to  300k soldiers on alert for europe deployment wow
UYxMSqq7azc,sad that some of us already forgot that this war is happening still
UYxMSqq7azc,making people think with their own heads
UYxMSqq7azc,elite fighting  elite  but  they  use humanity as their disposable war machines
UYxMSqq7azc,a question  how long will it take for finland and sweden to be full members in nato 
UYxMSqq7azc,there is no peace without justice
UYxMSqq7azc,dear world i hope you will open your consciences and seek your critical minds i am really praying for all of us
UYxMSqq7azc,i just hope were find another way instead of war
UYxMSqq7azc,may you all find the happiness that you deserve things will get better
UYxMSqq7azc,that exposition forgets to mention that each time nato responded was to protect people and countries from dictators like putin
UYxMSqq7azc,peculiar how russia is upset at ukraine procuring weapons from ally countries when they are the ones on the defense were they supposed to just sit there and be bombed
UYxMSqq7azc,god bless russia greetings from greece brothers
UYxMSqq7azc,i stand by my european brothers and sisters
UYxMSqq7azc,speak softly and carry a big stick wise words from good ol teddy
UYxMSqq7azc,all of you are spewing out unoriginal quotes im just impressed by that russian guys understanding of english duplicity this guy knows english better then some english speakers lol
UYxMSqq7azc,all we are saying
UYxMSqq7azc,russia will have to feel the sting before any of this stops
UYxMSqq7azc,go russia
UYxMSqq7azc,the efec enforcer corps motto was right si vis pacem para bellum
UYxMSqq7azc,its weird im seeing a bunch of old men fighting and im in the middle of it all
UYxMSqq7azc,as a veteran suddenly i understand pre wwii usa thinking were willing to help you when you come to your senses and ask
UYxMSqq7azc,there is no peace without a war

BpY3OPWM3pU,i like him instead of everyone play like the same jacking up 3 pointers it is refreshing to see some unique specialist in the nba
BpY3OPWM3pU,i still think the suns would win this series but the fact that the pelicans dragged it to 6 games is truly impressive
BpY3OPWM3pU,hes bringing back the old school 1v1 defense with new energy
BpY3OPWM3pU,cp3 strengths
BpY3OPWM3pU,alvarado and the rest of the pelicans played with a ton of heart as a suns fan you gotta thank them for making the series so exciting
BpY3OPWM3pU,alvarado was clamping up on chris paul on this play but too bad for the pelicans they let this game get away from them
BpY3OPWM3pU,best nba playoffs in a long timefeels like the 90s all over again
BpY3OPWM3pU,as a suns fan jose alvarado has become one of my fav non suns players in the league after this series gotta respect the energy and fire he has
BpY3OPWM3pU,i would call him the lesstalk same hustle pat beverly
BpY3OPWM3pU,man i loving this dude now hes a game changer
BpY3OPWM3pU,cp so sick cuz he looked as soon as he seen him and waited for him he was scared to start running
BpY3OPWM3pU,love players like him    keep doin  great and proving doubters  wrong 
BpY3OPWM3pU,remember back in the day when stars actually were respected for playing defense and not just their abilities to shoot from half court
BpY3OPWM3pU,alvarado is gonna miss playing against cp3 so much once this series is done
BpY3OPWM3pU,laughed my ass off when he waved to the ref after crossing the line later in the game
BpY3OPWM3pU,you see a number of suns fans on the sidelines smiling and appreciating the guts of alvarado
BpY3OPWM3pU,you have to play with 100 effort to play like alvarado every second is hustle i like him a lot
BpY3OPWM3pU,he appeals to me its good to see some unique specialists in the nba rather than everyone playing the same way and jacking up 3 shots
BpY3OPWM3pU,from mr yes i can shoot to grand theft alvarado love to see it
BpY3OPWM3pU,im surprised they still managed to make it into 22 alvarado really is an important player
BpY3OPWM3pU,jose alvarado brings that brooklyn basketball energy to the nba
BpY3OPWM3pU,hes a half court defense master
BpY3OPWM3pU,cp3 had to stop for 4 full seconds just to check where alvarado is then  only 4 seconds to cross half court or pass the ball
BpY3OPWM3pU,thats the second time ive ever seen him do that
BpY3OPWM3pU,it wasnt an 8 second violation  gains control at 2 seconds and crosses midcourt at 10
BpY3OPWM3pU,as a fan of his when he was at tech looove love me some jose alvarado
BpY3OPWM3pU,patrick beverly 20
BpY3OPWM3pU,these playoffs have been phenomenal so far
BpY3OPWM3pU,his celebration
BpY3OPWM3pU,i absolutley love alvarado
BpY3OPWM3pU,suns fans getting owned by an undrafted rookie
BpY3OPWM3pU,now thats straight up bs a tech for 8 second violation
BpY3OPWM3pU,dedication grind  and some playoff basketball facetime gone get you paid young man keep going
BpY3OPWM3pU,jose alvarado and patrick beverly on the same team would be insane 
BpY3OPWM3pU,love seeing nba players play defenseits rare but it does happen sometimes
BpY3OPWM3pU,its such a close call he took possession of the ball at back end of two seconds and was a cross mid court by the back end of 10 seconds
BpY3OPWM3pU,bro still thinks its the ncaa i love it
BpY3OPWM3pU,defensive player of the year
BpY3OPWM3pU,more importantly weve to note that cp 3 had 1 turnover the whole game
BpY3OPWM3pU,the shot clock restarted early  but damn good effort by the defender
BpY3OPWM3pU,rare 8 sighting but looking at the timer yeah cp was still backcourt at 8 seconds
BpY3OPWM3pU,love his energy on the d
BpY3OPWM3pU,watch the seconds count down on the clock from the point of grabbing the rebound and tell me that was 8 seconds great defense though
BpY3OPWM3pU,alvarado gonna be haunting cp3 in his dreams
BpY3OPWM3pU,it was like a 75 second violation
BpY3OPWM3pU,alvarados ankles are so tough
BpY3OPWM3pU,didnt know you could touch the refs thought it was an automatic ejection
BpY3OPWM3pU,that was a huge play i like this guy
BpY3OPWM3pU,look cp3 found himself a new confidant
BpY3OPWM3pU,it was a travelingcarrying violation before thatcp3 gets away with a lot of shit
BpY3OPWM3pU,jose alvarado is everything pat beverly wants to be
BpY3OPWM3pU,i really wanted the pels to win this game
BpY3OPWM3pU,i cannot stand cp3 all he does is complain to the officials for 48 minutes
BpY3OPWM3pU,he kind reminds me of clay guida the ufc fighter
BpY3OPWM3pU,this dude is making a name for himself really quick with his hustle and defense thats rare these days
BpY3OPWM3pU,alvarado bringing the heart of 90s defense to the athleticism of the present now thats fucking basketball
BpY3OPWM3pU,what was the tech for still trying to see something
BpY3OPWM3pU,i mean that is some good hussle on d and cp definitely double dribbled but that was a super short 8 second clock
BpY3OPWM3pU,i like this rookie effort no you dont have to full court press but you can see that he is trying to be a menace on defense period
BpY3OPWM3pU,cp religiously checks the corners now gta got him tweakin
BpY3OPWM3pU,my boy was strutting like thats 80s singer gerardo that sang rico suave to bad they lost
BpY3OPWM3pU,this man was seizing up for his celebration tho lmfaooo
BpY3OPWM3pU,damn man hes like a 2k mycareer that has full steal attribute
BpY3OPWM3pU,so this is the only turnover of cp3 in this game
BpY3OPWM3pU,the least respected player in the nba
BpY3OPWM3pU,that was some defense by zack dela rochai mean jose alvarado
BpY3OPWM3pU,lets go jose
BpY3OPWM3pU,you gotta love guys like jose and pat pev
BpY3OPWM3pU,gimme the ball chris chris just give me the ball probably the ref
BpY3OPWM3pU,great defense but that was 7 seconds
BpY3OPWM3pU,hope to see more like him like gp2
BpY3OPWM3pU,gta is literally the reason i watch the pells since zion got out he a poor mans patrick beverley but can also pass him really soon
BpY3OPWM3pU,wow stop been so defensive bro
BpY3OPWM3pU,alvarado introducing him to chris karma
BpY3OPWM3pU,never seen a defender do a spin move before
BpY3OPWM3pU,neither my teams but that was a fast 8 seconds d
BpY3OPWM3pU,thats a great defense by ja  nice move
BpY3OPWM3pU,dude got menace on hof
BpY3OPWM3pU,holy shit a guy that actually plays tough d in 2022 havent seen that in at least 1020 years
BpY3OPWM3pU,cp did waste alot of time just standing around after he got the rebound they need to be more like old okc and just run the ball up the court
BpY3OPWM3pU,cp3 always pushing those 8 seconds anyway idk why
BpY3OPWM3pU,no way that was 8 great defense tho
BpY3OPWM3pU,it looks like the clock started at 23 seconds not 24 after the rebound
BpY3OPWM3pU,he actually was in the backcourt 10secs from the moment he had the ball the ref gave him a extra 2sec
BpY3OPWM3pU,this the guy you hate in pick up but would immediately have him on your team
BpY3OPWM3pU,def 9 seconds is what i counted nice defense
BpY3OPWM3pU,even though they lost we can clearly see alvarado owned cp haha he cant be the cp that he used to be

TGYrvFsiAgw,gottmik is like the girl that goes along with everything the mean girl says cos she doesnt want that energy turned back on her triggering
TGYrvFsiAgw,i am a hardcore yvie stan but her look was so unfinished tooting her for that and then booting raja for that look is very confusing to me
TGYrvFsiAgw,thats a bold opinion its okay to be wrong sometimes  bosco
TGYrvFsiAgw,everyone we gotta look on the positive side herewe got bob back as the host of the pit stop
TGYrvFsiAgw,i firmly believe after watching violet for many years that she hates when someone looks better than her shes beautiful but a hater
TGYrvFsiAgw,not afraid to spend some money violet is giving classism
TGYrvFsiAgw,if youre not watching raja and raven youre not watching fashion photo ruview
TGYrvFsiAgw,violet not being able to tell that shea is wearing maison valentino aw 2019 just shows that she is not the fashion queen she wants to be perceived as
TGYrvFsiAgw,absolutely never gonna forgive you for booting both of rajas looks that over the top 18th century king made my whole week i loved it so much
TGYrvFsiAgw,can we get someone who doesnt just agree with violet without adding anything new
TGYrvFsiAgw,when it came to monets look you can definitely see the cultural difference
TGYrvFsiAgw,booting raja embarrassing the fact that violet went viral withno went to her head
TGYrvFsiAgw,for me the most educational fpr was with shea hope she will do the next season with raja dream duo
TGYrvFsiAgw,shes not afraid to spend some money and i love that basically theyre classist
TGYrvFsiAgw,okay violet we need to talk
TGYrvFsiAgw,monets look is clearly for the culture the way they spoke about it felt less than savory
TGYrvFsiAgw,im not mad violet booted raja im mad that she booted it because she doesnt get the king louis reference eventho shes a fashion girl
TGYrvFsiAgw,raja was amazing and the fact she uses fashion in an inteligent way and made a reference to her first time in drag race she was perfect
TGYrvFsiAgw,the robbery of it all rajas look was absolutely fantastic there was nothing bad about her outfit its an absolute toot if not a shoot for me
TGYrvFsiAgw,we all make choices but baby these hosts are definitely a choice
TGYrvFsiAgw,booting the energy these two bring ill be skipped fpr this season
TGYrvFsiAgw,if violet ever does an all winners seasons shes setting a dangerous standard for herself with this sort of thing
TGYrvFsiAgw,they should have gotten two differentiating opinions because it feels like you just hear an echo after violet says something
TGYrvFsiAgw,im convinced beyonc could walk down that runway and violet would boot it
TGYrvFsiAgw,as much as i love these two fashion queens can you please bring sasha and aquaria
TGYrvFsiAgw,imagine booting a classic  french silhouette because its not corseted not everything is jpg violet
TGYrvFsiAgw,why do i love violet and gottmiki live for harsh critiques and controversial opinions thats what was missing for so long from fpr no gorge forevahhhh
TGYrvFsiAgw,i love rajas style she seems able to do anything stylish without needing to ask a designer or have a lot of money
TGYrvFsiAgw,get ready for all the boots even when the  looks are stellar its violet chachki and gottmik what can we expect
TGYrvFsiAgw,the fact that neither of them realized shea was wearing valentino sends mmeeee
TGYrvFsiAgw,i love how honest these two queens are when it comes to their opinions keep it up guys
TGYrvFsiAgw,this felt more like an episode of mean girls than fashion photo review i loved rajas look
TGYrvFsiAgw,no they have to go violet is really feeling herself
TGYrvFsiAgw,i have never seen the fandom turn on a queen so quickly i swear everyone used to live for violet lmao
TGYrvFsiAgw,talking about choices the tone of this  fashion photo ruview  is a choice now i realise how much i miss raja  raven doing this they made this show iconic
TGYrvFsiAgw,not everything needs a belt and has to show skin raja is so meticulous in all the outfits she does she knows what shes doin
TGYrvFsiAgw,ugh these two definitely did for understand monets look it was so good  shes representing her blackness black culture but make it a crowned queen i lived for it
TGYrvFsiAgw,this comment section is giving get her jade energy and im living for it haha
TGYrvFsiAgw,sheas look is so beautiful it hurts in every possible way and still leaves you craving for more like how can something be so perfect
TGYrvFsiAgw,monets whole outfit was fabulous and no one can change my mind although i agree sheas was the best
TGYrvFsiAgw,i was so excited for this now im not excited for this this fpr is total boot at least the pitstop got it right by bringing back bob
TGYrvFsiAgw,rajas outfit is giving me 18th century caricatures of mens fashion its so drag i love it im disappointed that they missed the reference
TGYrvFsiAgw,violet booting both of rajas looks from ep 1  2 is bold the choices were choiced
TGYrvFsiAgw,best fashion photo ruview duo ever love it love violet
TGYrvFsiAgw,so much for drag queens that appreciate different types of drag 
TGYrvFsiAgw,can we please get new hosts that appreciate drag that isnt just coursets and gowns
TGYrvFsiAgw,everyone is asking for violet to host this then shes being honest with it now everyones attacking her
TGYrvFsiAgw,yesss  so happy to have violet hosting the show loves  it
TGYrvFsiAgw,i really enjoyed jaidas look bc for me it gave  caribbean queen fantasy  i really enjoyed her look tropical extravaganza
TGYrvFsiAgw,ill give you versatility when violet stops wearing corsets and gotmik starts saying no to violet
TGYrvFsiAgw,oh boy raja you better win this season because we are missing you on fashion photo ruview its gonna be a looooong season of petty boots
TGYrvFsiAgw,the internet told violet that her  no attitude was funny in shangelas words i blame yall
TGYrvFsiAgw,im living my best life this is comedy the girls are having fun do they know fashion who cares
TGYrvFsiAgw,when shea came out i literally gasped the african reference made me fall in love with her all over again an absolute shoot
TGYrvFsiAgw,rajas look being booted makes me question everything i thought i knew about violet also surprised the dolls didnt recognize the haute couture on shea darlings do better
TGYrvFsiAgw,violet i love it
TGYrvFsiAgw,love these two and agree with almost everything they say
TGYrvFsiAgw,we love a pair of good polemic controversial queens
TGYrvFsiAgw,yaaaas i see violet and gottmik in a video together i automatically watch it
TGYrvFsiAgw,violet in fashion photo ruview and bob in pitstop is the best combo ever
TGYrvFsiAgw,now this just proves that not every single friendship pair out there can do fashion photo ruview
TGYrvFsiAgw,the way they both laugh
TGYrvFsiAgw,omg i freaking love violet
TGYrvFsiAgw,sheas look is unforgettable just stunning she came out and my jaw dropped i was speechless
TGYrvFsiAgw,love the intense critiques seemingly better than the show
TGYrvFsiAgw,i feel like im the only one who absolutely loved viviennes look it was giving first ethereal queen fantasy one of my favourites
TGYrvFsiAgw,i love jinkxs take on the english renaissance the look reminds me of queen elizabeth i

VjTh03_ssHo,do you trust sony to be able to produce a high end gaming monitor
VjTh03_ssHo,very happy to see sony return to the monitor market i hope in the future they will expand their range to include 32 inch size
VjTh03_ssHo,people are complaining about the price but there are zero 4k 144hz gaming monitors that have 96 dimming zones below 1000
VjTh03_ssHo,lots to like here but heres hoping this means theyll also release native driver support for their controllers so things can work seamlessly
VjTh03_ssHo,really cant wait to see some more reviews of this my current ultrawides hdr400 is basically unusable for hdr gaming and barely passes sdr bright test
VjTh03_ssHo,why im smiling the whole time by watching this vid bro your smile is very contagious
VjTh03_ssHo,i love the set up of this video it would be accurate if sony werent already known for producing some of the best gaming monitors back in the crt days
VjTh03_ssHo,i like the direction sony is taking here
VjTh03_ssHo,would be cool to see comparison between playstation display and inzone monitor
VjTh03_ssHo,they should have released a 32 screen for the 4k monitor imo i would have definitely bought this instead of the gigabyte m32u
VjTh03_ssHo,would this take advantage of the xbox series x  i love the style of it just wondered if it would be good for xbox
VjTh03_ssHo,my biggest problem with the monitor is its size 4k resolution warrants a 32in display at least
VjTh03_ssHo,cameron is amazing now that dieter is gone hes definitely my favourite
VjTh03_ssHo,sony should release a 32 of this monitor
VjTh03_ssHo,what a lot of people care about is how it works with and mac minimacbook pro and the xbox sxss
VjTh03_ssHo,can i use the headset for wfh im fully expecting a mic test when your review comes out lol
VjTh03_ssHo,if they release a 1440p 144hz version then i will be interested 4k 144hz is still too hard to run to be worth it imo
VjTh03_ssHo,2k monitor would have been great fhd is no more acceptable for a mid range or high end monitor
VjTh03_ssHo,i wish they made a 24 one
VjTh03_ssHo,so proud of sony
VjTh03_ssHo,if this comes in 32in i would buy
VjTh03_ssHo,4k oled has 8 million local dimming zones just sayin
VjTh03_ssHo,im not a monitor player but i want this lol
VjTh03_ssHo,i hv my ps5 for 2 years now
VjTh03_ssHo,how would this do for a xbox series x
VjTh03_ssHo,can it charge via the usbc though and if so how much wattage
VjTh03_ssHo,does it come with a remote it would be nice to have a remote to turn on the monitor
VjTh03_ssHo,if they make a 4k 240 hz 245 monitor ill buy it in a heart beat since they have a good track record with tvs already 
VjTh03_ssHo,does the usb c port offer power delivery for charging a laptop
VjTh03_ssHo,sony is the best at making good jack of all trade but master of none d its good actually who the hell needs the most perfect black anyway
VjTh03_ssHo,all that i want to know is are these headphones going to be compatible with the ps5 via bluetooth
VjTh03_ssHo,would you rather have this or an lg c1 in 48 for the same money
VjTh03_ssHo,does it also have custum crosshair option like a monitor
VjTh03_ssHo,shouldve been 32 4k not 27
VjTh03_ssHo,sony fald tvs dont do vrr and local dimming at the same time hopefullysurely they addressed this issue with the monitors
VjTh03_ssHo,for ips panel this should be a 32 inch display  for 400 more ill take alien wares 34 oled
VjTh03_ssHo,nice design bur id go with the odyssey g8
VjTh03_ssHo,the monitor design looks extremely similar to the gigabyte monitor
VjTh03_ssHo,sony always coming out with some premium stuff and always premium pricing
VjTh03_ssHo,ogs will remember the old ps 3d display
VjTh03_ssHo,15 years ago could have been cool
VjTh03_ssHo,i only like gaming on bigger screens like from 65
VjTh03_ssHo,a 32 inch for 899 i would like 27 isnt good enough for me anymore im thinking about upgrading for 42 oled tv as my next monitor
VjTh03_ssHo,this is what i have wanted like how cant i not use my sony xm4s with bluetooth on my ps5 come on
VjTh03_ssHo,this better be vesa compliant
VjTh03_ssHo,yay i love cameron videos
VjTh03_ssHo,more videos with cameron please
VjTh03_ssHo,sony is tripping as usual hell i wait to get from one of those spiteful angry wife or girlfriend in facebook market for a 100 bucks
VjTh03_ssHo,with cheapest 1440p 144 or 165hz ips 27 inch monitors going for 250300 usd i dont think this is worth it  although being 4k
VjTh03_ssHo,why dont they make a ultrawide version
VjTh03_ssHo,a 32 inch version and ill buy asap
VjTh03_ssHo,we need a black version for both screen and headphones until then ill wait
VjTh03_ssHo,i wish there was a 32 inch monitor
VjTh03_ssHo,amazing  thanks a lot for video
VjTh03_ssHo,what game was he playing in this video looks fun
VjTh03_ssHo,post more video at least once a week
VjTh03_ssHo,having a hard time seeing anybody dropping 1k on a 27inch monitor instead of playing on a 70inch oled screen at the same price maybe thats just me
VjTh03_ssHo,what panel type vatn ips
VjTh03_ssHo,what about 1440p support
VjTh03_ssHo,i cant wait until linus from linus tech tips gives us his take on these monitors
VjTh03_ssHo,ill stick with my playstation 3d display
VjTh03_ssHo,does it have a fan what about coil whine
VjTh03_ssHo,meman sony really should stop naming their products after random numbers
VjTh03_ssHo,this should be a 32 4k model
VjTh03_ssHo,i must insist on more videos with cameron please verge
VjTh03_ssHo,ill just take the samsung odyssey g7 28 hdmi 21 instead
VjTh03_ssHo,i think sony takes pride in choosing the worst possible names for their products
VjTh03_ssHo,well done video
VjTh03_ssHo,cameron is the golden god of the verge
VjTh03_ssHo,lol i paid over 500 cad for inzone h9 hopefully its worth it
VjTh03_ssHo,h3 headset is what i want
VjTh03_ssHo,when does this release
VjTh03_ssHo,vergelet me do some more tests
VjTh03_ssHo,would purchase for 599
VjTh03_ssHo,that smile just brightened my day
VjTh03_ssHo,which games did they showcase
VjTh03_ssHo,my only complaintsuggestion would be that for the pricing offered why not produce it with a built in hd camera
VjTh03_ssHo,whats the power delivery of usbc
VjTh03_ssHo,might actually pick this display up for my m1 mbp ps5 just seems better on my large tv but im not much of a gamer
VjTh03_ssHo,i might get this
VjTh03_ssHo,2k monitors are the sweet spot  allows you to get away with a lower priced video card
VjTh03_ssHo,bruh its an acer panel sony doesnt make ips panels they buy them and stick them in a pretty case
VjTh03_ssHo,id still rather splurge a little more and get a 42 inch oled
VjTh03_ssHo,now if they would only start making ps5s so we can buy one
0fDJXmqdN-A,this looks like the things youd see in a dream where everything doesnt makes sense but they just fit together nicely
0fDJXmqdN-A,really cool you can see the parts where the ai was interpreting the lyrics
0fDJXmqdN-A,this video shows perfectly the core of most ai is interpolation the seamless morphs were great
0fDJXmqdN-A,imagine if this was created by a person instead of an ai how would we even classify a mind like that its like a persistent psychedelic state
0fDJXmqdN-A,this is honestly insane and feels like it could very well have been the official amv for the song ai has gone so far
0fDJXmqdN-A,it looks amazing i cant believe i havent seen this being utilized more
0fDJXmqdN-A,wow this is impressive watching these strange shapes actually form into something tangible then moving off and becoming just an amalgamation of shapes and colors
0fDJXmqdN-A,its truly amazing that we can now conjure images into existence from words like wizards casting spells
0fDJXmqdN-A,i would love to see this on a 4k 3d systemthis is like a 4d on a 3d platform of our interpretation of images viewed in natural beauty its amazing
0fDJXmqdN-A,ai is more creative than me 
0fDJXmqdN-A,the seamless transitions from realistic images sketches and digital art are mindboggling
0fDJXmqdN-A,as a 3d artist graphic designer painter and draftsman seeing this just reminds me
0fDJXmqdN-A,the transitions are amazing and it goes well with the lyrics especially when they state whats your vision
0fDJXmqdN-A,amazing i would love to see more and much longer versions
0fDJXmqdN-A,i hope to see another one of these music  videos soon  this could be a whole new genre
0fDJXmqdN-A,great trip without the hallucinogenics seems like youve been to the other side and brought it back with you for all to see and experience your artistry is insane
0fDJXmqdN-A,awesome visual of how a computer thinks or uses its artificial imagination quite dreamy as most have said
0fDJXmqdN-A,the best representation of dont let others know your next move
0fDJXmqdN-A,absolutely beautifully phenomenal artwork done by that ai i must ask how did you begin your journey in ai
0fDJXmqdN-A,this is such a trip it helps me to visualize how multiple dimensions could be overlapping simultaneously in our world
0fDJXmqdN-A,this is pretty much the most accurate visual representation of a psychedelic transport  utterly incredible amazing job ai
0fDJXmqdN-A,id love to see ai make both the music and video curious what that would soundlook like
0fDJXmqdN-A,the style of this is like something between fantasy cyberpunk and paintings its really interesting to see new landscapes appear out of the infinitely zooming camera view
0fDJXmqdN-A,this is actually a brilliant videothe blending of shape and form of vision with the concept of eyes that seestunning
0fDJXmqdN-A,this is one of the best things ever  cant wait until we can have this kind of thing generated realtime for a screensaver or whatnot 
0fDJXmqdN-A,i really like this i am personally interested in ai especially as it applies to robotics this is quite something thanks for posting
0fDJXmqdN-A,thank you for actually describing the entire process in the description so many people think that ai is just generating these images from scratch with no input from the user
0fDJXmqdN-A,its incredible that ai is capable of making this but im afraid of the future of actual illustrators
0fDJXmqdN-A,this is beautiful actually and nicely painted too
0fDJXmqdN-A,this was on another level i thought it came up with the song too would be interesting to hear a song made by ai
0fDJXmqdN-A,brilliant work and really enjoyable to watch a nice reminder of what can be achieved between man and machine
0fDJXmqdN-A,wow what am i on
0fDJXmqdN-A,completely amazing like a psychedelic trip you picked a good song also the most amazing feature is the continual morphing
0fDJXmqdN-A,this must be the best video done with ai would love to see a tutorial
0fDJXmqdN-A,this is so crazy its like every image is its own image that is a different image
0fDJXmqdN-A,you can tell where the ai gets a lot of its imagery from it keeps dropping painter signatures into the scene
0fDJXmqdN-A,glad we finally get the long awaited doodlechaos voice reveal
0fDJXmqdN-A,its like in a dream where the scenery changes gradually this effect is the closest thing to my personal experience with such dreams
0fDJXmqdN-A,this was really cool there were definitely hints of something incredible it just wasnt quite realized
0fDJXmqdN-A,this is incredible it inspired me to learn disco diffusion and now im in the process of making my own animated music video for my music
0fDJXmqdN-A,this is absolutely genius endless imagination we could be easily the imagination of ai playing level 3
0fDJXmqdN-A,absolutely spectacular work i tried to do something similar a few months ago but was no where near as successful
0fDJXmqdN-A,fantastic video probably the best representation of how the mind works to be honest also a good flow of how life flows with all of its complexities fantastic
0fDJXmqdN-A,well that was amazing thanks for sharing quite beautiful i had to watch it again a few times it gives me the goosebumps
0fDJXmqdN-A,this is awesome so beautiful i love the imagery  colors
0fDJXmqdN-A,if a person made this i would be in absolute awe best art ive ever seen
0fDJXmqdN-A,this is pretty incredible thoughts on a commissioned work like this for an original song
0fDJXmqdN-A,wow kind of assumed this would be some clickbaity thing but watching it reading the detailed and inspiring description im a massive fan mad respect
0fDJXmqdN-A,i love you for making this this is art at its finest level
0fDJXmqdN-A,its actually genuinely insane how perfectly this video encapsulates what a dream looks like i mean
0fDJXmqdN-A,thanks you two for a great collaboration
0fDJXmqdN-A,please do  more of these this could be a whole new genre
0fDJXmqdN-A,the transition is surreal ive never seen anything like this
0fDJXmqdN-A,wow this is seriously good pretty amazing how you do the transitions and movements to sync with the song and give it extra meaning subscribed
0fDJXmqdN-A,i like how one thing seamlessly transitions to another
0fDJXmqdN-A,i am happy to be in a time where such beautiful things exist
0fDJXmqdN-A,this is amazing very trippy indeed
0fDJXmqdN-A,this is so psychedelic blows my mind that ai can do this
0fDJXmqdN-A,wow amazing that the ai could come up with such cool lyrics
0fDJXmqdN-A,this is the most amazing music video i think i have ever seen this is so mind blowing like beyond incredible holy cow
0fDJXmqdN-A,so how do one go about to ask an ai for this

HSst53uX6qQ,this was a good baseball game overall
HSst53uX6qQ,way to
HSst53uX6qQ,great start before heading off to the buzzsaw big apple  lets carry this momentum into yankee stadium
HSst53uX6qQ,lets go astros
HSst53uX6qQ,our pitching staff dropping like flies
HSst53uX6qQ,4th series loss for the metstheir doing great this year
HSst53uX6qQ,yordans hrs would be out in yellowstone park
HSst53uX6qQ,this just shows how important jeff mcneil is for the mets he would have propelled the mets by getting a hit with 2 on or bases loaded
HSst53uX6qQ,if youre above 500 you will have trouble against the astros and if youre the angels lol
HSst53uX6qQ,mets need more hitting after alonso great opportunity wasted tonight
HSst53uX6qQ,astros have to thank the mets for providing them with batting practice
HSst53uX6qQ,mets had lot of chances to lead

HSst53uX6qQ,gongrats astros
HSst53uX6qQ,mets lost 7 straight to the astros in the astros stadium  im pissed this guy gave up two back to back home runs
HSst53uX6qQ,lets go mets 
HSst53uX6qQ,these two could possibly meet in the world series

HSst53uX6qQ,hey mess fans
HSst53uX6qQ,escobar needs to stop chasing  play the ball coulda easily scored 12 more runs in the 6th smfh nimmo woulda held it down if he had a chance at bat
HSst53uX6qQ,lol silly mets thinks they can win the division and go to the playoffs
HSst53uX6qQ,the astros dont need cheating

Juege0ub_V8,i never thought id live long enough to see tampa getting devastated like this jeez that was awful
Juege0ub_V8,give them nothing but take from them everything this quote from the movie 300 describes this game so aptly
Juege0ub_V8,this is what happens when you play deep into the playoffs year after year you get worn down avs look more energetic and hungrier good for them go avs
Juege0ub_V8,you know a team is struggling in a game when their captain and best forwards are in their own crease trying to keep the puck out of their net
Juege0ub_V8,i told everyone that colorado was just too good
Juege0ub_V8,i didnt expect that but its still only 1 game keep your foot on the gas boys
Juege0ub_V8,it should be 100 what a game 
Juege0ub_V8,the lightning should thank the avs tonight playing against colorado clearly made their entire roster 3 years younger

Juege0ub_V8,awesome what a performance by the avalanche
Juege0ub_V8,you can tell how much the avs want the cup great hockey
Juege0ub_V8,crazy to think that in order for the lightning to have been in this game they would have had to have scored on nearly 50 of all of their shots
Juege0ub_V8,great job avs
Juege0ub_V8,legendary effort from the avs respect
99iFAW9fvh8,when i was in the army everyone kept telling me there will never be another big war again involving large armies and tanks history is in one big loop
99iFAW9fvh8,watching this feels surreal i think we are heading towards some really tough times hopefully im wrong
99iFAW9fvh8,his comments about russia starting wars badly but its depth and ability to suffer losses and regroup was chillingly reminiscent of ww2
99iFAW9fvh8,this had to be said europe must prepare for a war and do whatever it can to prevent it
99iFAW9fvh8,my thoughts and prayers are with all those who had to endure this the world needs to unite love from ireland
99iFAW9fvh8,im 68 and missed world 2 always prayed i would live my life without a world war 3  i am very worried that this may not happen
99iFAW9fvh8,i know not with what weapons world war iii will be fought but world war iv will be fought with sticks and stones  albert einstein
99iFAW9fvh8,those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it winston churchill
99iFAW9fvh8,if this is what were publicly speaking about lets think about what intelligence this change in posture has been driven by behind the scenes
99iFAW9fvh8,im skeptical of anyone who preaches the fourth industrial revolution this guys part of the plan
99iFAW9fvh8,did he forget about afghanistan iraq syria libya and kosovo
99iFAW9fvh8,too funny when tyrants pretend to be so morale and compassionate and the sheep civilians actually believe it
99iFAW9fvh8,speaks about sovereignty but seems to forget about all the sovereign nations the uk and us invaded in recent years
99iFAW9fvh8,if world war 3 kicks off i will quit my job and spend the last days or moments with my family
99iFAW9fvh8,never heard of mobilization of an army to prevent wars wherever armies go war follows this is plain scary
99iFAW9fvh8,imagine a war where no one turned up
99iFAW9fvh8,im ukrainian in ukraine and this is what we are understand already i wish more countries understood that as well
99iFAW9fvh8,i worked with the british during the cold war excellent soldiers royal marines  black watch 2 para  7 armored brigade  absolutely top notch
99iFAW9fvh8,isnt it always the case that when recessiondepression looms large people are given something far worse to worry about to occupy their minds and daily lives
99iFAW9fvh8,i remember when they were making plans to make the british army smaller we havent seen a large conflict that would involve a large army in decades
99iFAW9fvh8,no we are facing a 1939 moment while talking about preparing for 1937
99iFAW9fvh8,the difference between 1937 and now is that there was no threat of a nuclear annihilation
99iFAW9fvh8,a very thought provoking speech and a very true one
99iFAW9fvh8,after all that pain i never thought i would hear that whole fleet management wasnt the solution going forward
99iFAW9fvh8,thats one most terrifying speeches in decades europe is rearming its russias fault though theyve left europe with no choice
99iFAW9fvh8,well this has ruined my day
99iFAW9fvh8,this means a global war  listen to this man it makes me extremely concerned for my great niece and nephew  actually concern for all of humanity 
99iFAW9fvh8,its more like a 1914 moment the main difference between now and 1914 was a britain that was largely united and relatively financially stable
99iFAW9fvh8,as bad as it is hes absolutely spot on
99iFAW9fvh8,sadly the post second world war of peace diplomacy and understanding is gone with the ukraine russia conflict
99iFAW9fvh8,the scariest thing isnt the russians its the state of our fighting age population 1849
99iFAW9fvh8,of all the periods in history i joined the army it was this one i just signed 3 more years for germany i hope i dont regret it
99iFAW9fvh8,this is refreshing a person in power who is actually not scared to say what needs to be said
99iFAW9fvh8,i had hoped my parents both born mid to late 30s in london would not see us return to such a state
99iFAW9fvh8,the speech he never thought he would need to give
99iFAW9fvh8,as gen sir patrick sanders said we cant be lighting the factory furnaces at the eve of war  this is a lesson learned during the 2nd world war
99iFAW9fvh8,in the first part of my 22 years people were finishing their service with no medals nowadays so many conflicts are happening everyone has medals
99iFAW9fvh8,not only dose history repeat its self its a broken record
99iFAW9fvh8,2014 should have been the last warning and not now
99iFAW9fvh8,great britain is indeed a country that moves in time with events happening upon the world stage and should be applauded for such actions
99iFAW9fvh8,80 year cycles
99iFAW9fvh8,having watched the moral decline of this nation over many years this situation was always going to be on the cards
99iFAW9fvh8,when an army related person warns about war a politician must listen to what they said to prevent such unnecesary bloodshed
99iFAW9fvh8,this man knows whats going on and has courage  glad hes in  charge
99iFAW9fvh8,this general hes the topgod bless him
99iFAW9fvh8,i hope the canadian military is empowered by the government to follow  suit they have fallen so far behind it due to government neglect it breaks my heart
99iFAW9fvh8,warwar never changes
99iFAW9fvh8,has anyone else seen this movie before spoiler it ends in tears
99iFAW9fvh8,but the british military has been cut to bare bones since 2010 defence review
99iFAW9fvh8,my deep gratitude and appreciation for sane thinking in the face of threats from the east
99iFAW9fvh8,this clear speech is encouraging to hear  no hyperbole or naivety a straightforward and professional plan to get ready to prevent the worst
99iFAW9fvh8,thats what they said sadly    toothose who felt the same to shed blood for people who dont even have your back
99iFAW9fvh8,i believe this is just the first speech and more from different countries will follow
99iFAW9fvh8,the evil is always someone else
99iFAW9fvh8,war between nuclear powers is impossible to win it seems weve all forgotten that
99iFAW9fvh8,an excellent speech
99iFAW9fvh8,only dead men have seen the end of war plato
99iFAW9fvh8,this is a historic speech and event for those who understand anything about warfare
99iFAW9fvh8,sting said theres no such thing as a winnable war  its a lie we dont believe anymore 
99iFAW9fvh8,we must be unequivocally prepared to fight for nato territory if this point came we would likely be outnumbered  fighting like hell at the point of entry

lzF3IQ6O6EA,awesome team is an understatement
lzF3IQ6O6EA,the problem i can see with chandler countering the spinning elbow with an uppercut is if tony lands his face is going to look like a buttcrack
lzF3IQ6O6EA,gaethje vs olivera gonna be a 5050 fight  i hope justin wins  but its gonna be a good one 
lzF3IQ6O6EA,where the hell is the champ episode 2 without the champ

lzF3IQ6O6EA,going to this fight im so fucking insanely excited
lzF3IQ6O6EA,i love tony so much but man i dont wanna see this fight
lzF3IQ6O6EA,this fight week is flying

QmIcFWu0US0,i bought my m1 13 pro a few months ago and was afraid i would get buyers remorse when the m2 came out apparently not the case
QmIcFWu0US0,they could have easily made the 256gb as fast as the other higher capacity models even with a single 256gb package
QmIcFWu0US0,well im going to wait to see if the same thing happens to mba and then decide what ssd capacity to buy
QmIcFWu0US0,maybe apple also downgraded the price of the m2 over the m1 to justify the its overall slower performance
QmIcFWu0US0,great video the big questions now are
QmIcFWu0US0,yup i actually realized the same thing which i found odd i was getting much higher results on the m1 sucks
QmIcFWu0US0,its not some grand conspiracy or even a mistake
QmIcFWu0US0,now i want to know if we choose 512gb version will they provide two 256gb ssd to get a better ssd read and write speed
QmIcFWu0US0,it seems apple being greedy as always want you to buy the new m2 mbp and upgrade both the ram  ssd storage to gain the maximum benefit of m2
QmIcFWu0US0,so technically if i upgraded ram to 16gb or upgrade ssd to be 512gb this will make m2 faster than m1 right which one is better
QmIcFWu0US0,apple m2 is 8 and 35  faster than m1
QmIcFWu0US0,can you try the 512gb variant which may possibly have two 256gb ssd
QmIcFWu0US0,i wonder if you upgrade to more storage will you get 2 ssd chips
QmIcFWu0US0,most likely will you will only get the dual ssds if you upgrade to higher capacity yikes
QmIcFWu0US0,to me the big problem here is the 256gb in a 1000 usd 2022 laptop
QmIcFWu0US0,i dont think this idea came from a engineer engineers want
QmIcFWu0US0,great video
QmIcFWu0US0,the m1 macbook pro ssd is up to twice as fast as the ssd in the m2 macbook pro will the m2 macbook air face the same performance hit
QmIcFWu0US0,im waiting for the m2 air but only concern is since it lacks a fan im afraid itll throttle wanna pick up a max spec version for travel video editing
QmIcFWu0US0,the real issue ssd is soldered and contains the firmware meaning its mandatory even when booting to an external drive
QmIcFWu0US0,my only concern tho will this effect the mba m2 as well
QmIcFWu0US0,do you think the m2 macbook air will have this downgrade too
QmIcFWu0US0,on the possible upside does this mean that we could install a second nand flash chip ourselves will we be encountering issues by doing so
QmIcFWu0US0,this is a deal breaker for me i wont buy the mba m2 if this happen too i m waiting for your test result in mba m2
QmIcFWu0US0,wouldnt it be possible to upgrade the storage then
QmIcFWu0US0,the pins appear to be present for a second chip i suspect the upgraded storage models will have a second chip allowing for the higher read speeds
QmIcFWu0US0,quite simple really reduce the cost by using 1 nand it could have been even faster but they decided to accept less speed to save cost
QmIcFWu0US0,how would you know getting  512gb ssd will be on two 256gbs
QmIcFWu0US0,so just buy the m2 air as the only real difference is it doesnt have a fan while the pro does
QmIcFWu0US0,a refurbished 13 m1 pro seems like the best deal right now
QmIcFWu0US0,do you think theyre going to change the ssd in the m1 macbook air now
QmIcFWu0US0,ive got a 16g m1 and i max out the ram and swap regularly just by having lots of paused youtube video tabs
QmIcFWu0US0,enjoy your soldered down ssd   beyond words really  next apple will remove the screws so you cannot even get in the bottom
QmIcFWu0US0,okay apart from everything this video was made so professionally i love it
QmIcFWu0US0,what if we get 1 tb storage will that have two ssd chips
QmIcFWu0US0,doesnt the empty ssd slot mean that we can actually upgrade the ssd in the future by adding another 256 gb in the other slot
QmIcFWu0US0,any idea if this is the same for m1 and m2 macbook air
QmIcFWu0US0,so if m2 mbp is equipped with 16gb of ram then the performance would double
QmIcFWu0US0,just spend a few more bucks and buy the m2 air the m2 pro is a waste of money for a lot of other reasons than the slower write speed
QmIcFWu0US0,question if i was to buy a 13 inch macbook pro m2 16 ram with 256 gb will ssd be faster or i need to upgrade  to 512 gb 
QmIcFWu0US0,how about m2 macbook pro with 512 gb and 16 gb ram
QmIcFWu0US0,huge downgrade you have to upgrade the ssd to even be worth buying
QmIcFWu0US0,apple do seem to practice what to me looks like deceit
QmIcFWu0US0,i though 16gb of ram and 1tb ssd are the standard since a while
QmIcFWu0US0,so like the air m1 install thermal pads apple why
QmIcFWu0US0,good thing i wasnt in the market for this whatsoever the only upgrade i want it promotion
QmIcFWu0US0,i purchased a 512 gb model and my machine doesnt have the slow speed problem it does actually perform better than the m1 ran the same speed tests
QmIcFWu0US0,the big question  are the people who buy 512gb getting 2x 256gb which would double the speed
QmIcFWu0US0,this is how are they able to make the machine cost the same as it did in 2020
QmIcFWu0US0,meanwhile in the windows world most laptops have standard m2 slots and can easily be upgraded to a larger ssd drive
QmIcFWu0US0,i am gonna go with the secret plan option
QmIcFWu0US0,16 gb ram or 512 gb ssd what should we upgrade for more snappier and fast performance like app opening web browsing etc plz reply
QmIcFWu0US0,ahhhh the joys of soldered on components want an upgrade you can do that to an entire new laptop
QmIcFWu0US0,something tells me macbook air m2 is gonna be faster
QmIcFWu0US0,im curious on the raid type  somebody who knows how to use terminal find out for us on core storage
QmIcFWu0US0,found this just in time to cancel my order thank you
QmIcFWu0US0,will the 512 gb model have two chips 256 each or will there be only a single chip soldered on
QmIcFWu0US0,the real question is which m2 config comes with 2 nands
QmIcFWu0US0,well you can easily find a professional guy to add another 256gb nand chip on the free slot
QmIcFWu0US0,very helpful i had to subscribe after watching thanks
QmIcFWu0US0,could you test the m2s compatibility with 1440p monitors and ultrawide monitors
QmIcFWu0US0,a 3000 laptop should not have ssd chips that are soldered on the mobo especially an ssd that has only 250 gb capacity period
QmIcFWu0US0,what about m2 air so curious
QmIcFWu0US0,well i allways prefer the slc nand type
QmIcFWu0US0,what if they do the same on the m2 macbook air
QmIcFWu0US0,this feels like the iphone 7 problem where the lower storage you get the lower the overall performance you get
QmIcFWu0US0,does the 512gb model also use a single nand or two
QmIcFWu0US0,m1 user my external thunderbolt ssd have speed issue it is much slower than the internal ssd
iGyTmRNB7l8,the question isnt why does he keep pranking his cousin the question is why doesnt he prank her more often
iGyTmRNB7l8,the guy who played the secret service agent was so believable i almost forgot it was a prank lol and micki was adorable
iGyTmRNB7l8,lol the montage of hard hitting questions from all of those real journalists was hilarious
iGyTmRNB7l8,the actor playing the secret service agent is spoton convincing would have had me sweating
iGyTmRNB7l8,what a delightful person cousin micki is to have around shes a star
iGyTmRNB7l8,the fake interview with your cousin micki was hilarious more of those pranks
iGyTmRNB7l8,shes a good sport having jimmy as a family member seems dangerous
iGyTmRNB7l8,props to the actor he comes over very sternly and its amazing that he keeps a straight face throughout a true professional
iGyTmRNB7l8,how am i not supposed to vote for judge fudge  sadly california sent fudge packing
iGyTmRNB7l8,i would always say the truth for god omg mickie is precious
iGyTmRNB7l8,honestly if a secret service agent tells you that you need to recite the pledge that should be a huge red white and blue flag something is up
iGyTmRNB7l8,its like taking a scantron test you cant fail oh no jimmy no no you can definitely fail
iGyTmRNB7l8,we all know that guillermo takes his job seriously when it really matters presidential visits day drinking at the emmys  nba press conference finals
iGyTmRNB7l8,props to the man in the suit for not breaking character mustve been so hard
iGyTmRNB7l8,thanks for all the great comedic remarks from fox
iGyTmRNB7l8,she definitely needs to be pranked more often
iGyTmRNB7l8,cousin micki is so damn sweet and good hearted that i feel terrible each time i have to watch her get pranked 
iGyTmRNB7l8,i love how cousin micki immediately fall into a fetal position everytime jimmy pulls a prank on her and she gets embarrased
iGyTmRNB7l8,the removing the brandons bit made me laugh hard especially the bit with the claw machine
iGyTmRNB7l8,that bit with micki was hysterical especially when jimmy came out in the giraffe outfit perfect
iGyTmRNB7l8,id like to see more micki in my late night tv viewing
iGyTmRNB7l8,we love you cousin micki this must have been tough for her because she is such a sweet person
iGyTmRNB7l8,the prank on micki is honest to god an excellent example of how le interviews can elicit false confessions damn near text book
iGyTmRNB7l8,wow congrats jimmy so much runtime on everything fox channel has to offer great job getting so much free promotion
iGyTmRNB7l8,i feel so bad for his cousin but her squirming had me laughing
iGyTmRNB7l8,lol i really felt bad for her she was helpless
iGyTmRNB7l8,cousin micki was about to have a full blown panic attack by the end of that interview  great job by that actor playing the secret service agent
iGyTmRNB7l8,that drop to her knees was the very real  oh no he did to me again 
iGyTmRNB7l8,having fun while doing your job really shouldnt be hated so much atleast when the job is done correctly
iGyTmRNB7l8,that was so funny the fake agent did such a great job
iGyTmRNB7l8,funny how they were silent when trump called fox every day
iGyTmRNB7l8,good examples of complete hypocrisy thank you
iGyTmRNB7l8,great thing to show the hard hitting questions from real journalists at all those shitty networks
iGyTmRNB7l8,we love you jimmy keep exposing the rights lies
iGyTmRNB7l8,loved the fake secret service agent part jimmy keep up these pranks you did a good job on the interview by the way
iGyTmRNB7l8,foxs hard hitting interviews how are you so awesome mr president
iGyTmRNB7l8,i lost it when the guy said are you on drugs right now 
iGyTmRNB7l8,loved the way micki fell to the floor when she realised she had been pranked
iGyTmRNB7l8,she is adorable we need more of her in us
iGyTmRNB7l8,you need to have cousin mikki as a recurring segment she is hilarious
iGyTmRNB7l8,so you took an underage person to go steal
iGyTmRNB7l8,no ones outraged actually the opposite cause it just proves their point if youre agreeing with what jimmy kimmel says then hes doing his job
iGyTmRNB7l8,oh jimmy that was cruel  i love her
iGyTmRNB7l8,cousin micki really made me smile
iGyTmRNB7l8,how can we pray for you   wtf
iGyTmRNB7l8,that prank was hilarious but i was really hoping president biden was going to walk in as the supervisor
iGyTmRNB7l8,micki is one of the raddest beings on the planet
iGyTmRNB7l8,kimmy kimel finally had someone on her show at her mental level  happy for her
iGyTmRNB7l8,funny how fox had trump on almost everyday but joe cant do one interview on another network
iGyTmRNB7l8,youre going to give poor micki a heart attack
iGyTmRNB7l8,oh dear  my cheeks hurt  you could just feel the love between them   brilliant
iGyTmRNB7l8,with fox ignoring the jan 6th hearings can
iGyTmRNB7l8,it actually makes plenty of sense for biden to appear on kimmel hes the number one joke in america right now
iGyTmRNB7l8,cousin micki has to go through life and think every interaction with anyone could just be a sketch i would have my guard up at all times
iGyTmRNB7l8,bravo  jimmy  you kick it out of the  park so much free advertising from fox 
iGyTmRNB7l8,how to tell everyone youve been greased by your cult many times without telling everyone youve greased many times   bring joe biden on your show
iGyTmRNB7l8,that was the funniest prank ive seen in a long time no more easter bouncy houses for her lmao
iGyTmRNB7l8,the actor who played the secret service agent did a phenomenal job p
iGyTmRNB7l8,i like how the faux news guy says that biden should be interviewed by bret baier or a serious journalist
iGyTmRNB7l8,that interview with cousin micki was funny a classic gotchya
iGyTmRNB7l8,well fox that really worked out for you keep picking a fight with a great comedian with talented writers
iGyTmRNB7l8,to see this show from germany it feels good gives me hope keep going great great vital show  thank you
iGyTmRNB7l8,imagine a person of color going into a toy store trying to return something and then threatening to blow up the store
iGyTmRNB7l8,theyre not going to show the hearings because then they would have to tell the truth after their listeners had seen it  that is so pitiful
iGyTmRNB7l8,micki is adorable thank you very cute  segment
iGyTmRNB7l8,that fake interview was sooo realistic kudos to the actor he nailed it
iGyTmRNB7l8,you have the best staff jimmy
iGyTmRNB7l8,love how the laughs got quieter when gasoline was mentioned
iGyTmRNB7l8,jimmy youve got to stop bullying micky after my wifeshe is the sweetest girl ive ever seen greetings from the lowlands
iGyTmRNB7l8,wow jimmy got a lot of free advertising  thanks to all the news  outlets
iGyTmRNB7l8,watching the interview shows just how hard it is to explain a hot headed moment we always sound crazy afterwards
iGyTmRNB7l8,its really telling that when we as a society receive more honest and logical commentary from our comedians
iGyTmRNB7l8,jimmy you have the best pranks  that was great
iGyTmRNB7l8,lmao i really needed this this morning oh wow thank you jimmy
iGyTmRNB7l8,jimmy never even asked his any real questions
iGyTmRNB7l8,i love when she said what she had for dinner
iGyTmRNB7l8,i really loved this
iGyTmRNB7l8,poor cousin micki and that guy played a secret service agent so good
iGyTmRNB7l8,thank god for jimmy kimmel
iGyTmRNB7l8,i laughed so much i had tears in my eyes
iGyTmRNB7l8,secret service agent are you on drugs right now priceless
iGyTmRNB7l8,shes so sweet i was squirming when she tried to explain things
iGyTmRNB7l8,cousin micki is such a joy
iGyTmRNB7l8,absolutely brilliant that montage of clips
iGyTmRNB7l8,probably outraged over the cost of everything and the inability mentally to improve
iGyTmRNB7l8,my god fox  those other traitor channels are clowns love you jimmy keep calling out these hypocrites
iGyTmRNB7l8,give credit to male actor he did so good job as secret service
iGyTmRNB7l8,trump had 41 fox news appearances in 2 yrs in office
iGyTmRNB7l8,hows melania doing funniest line of the night creepy but funny

Fg1oKKz7NOw,rip boo you will forever be know as the nerdy cat who took down a whole jaguar thank you for all your cameos
Fg1oKKz7NOw,i would love to see more bad wii games played by avgn 3
Fg1oKKz7NOw,i love how nerd is trying so hard to do the crazy angry nerd faces but is ultimately overwhelmed by cuteness
Fg1oKKz7NOw,got a bit teary eyed at the end boo really was the real jaguar
Fg1oKKz7NOw,never expected to see james chug a whole beer to cats meowing ode to joy pleasantly surprised
Fg1oKKz7NOw,i feel like this whole episode was just an excuse for james to talk about his cat and i loved it
Fg1oKKz7NOw,we love you james ive been a diehard fan since 07 when i was just 9 always get super excited when you make new content
Fg1oKKz7NOw,as a fellow cat loverthis review was hilarious and the literbox part was funny as heck rip booyou will always be loved and remembered always

HndV87XpkWg,im glad i live in the age of the internet i learn every day ive never stopped being a student
HndV87XpkWg,ill tell you whats crazy having a timer on an exam session its not a race
HndV87XpkWg,high school became less stressful the moment i realized its just a day care on steroids
HndV87XpkWg,every single one of these videos is perfectly made with amazing points everything is so well thought out these videos make the world a better place
HndV87XpkWg,ive never let my schooling interfere with my education mark twain
HndV87XpkWg,good luck finding teachers who are qualified for this
HndV87XpkWg,i personally believe children and students should be taught to think for themselves they should learn to debate solve problems and be encouraged
HndV87XpkWg,i agree with a single exception
HndV87XpkWg,me not getting good grades in online classes
HndV87XpkWg,the difficult thing for me as a student is to find the practical use of what i learn
HndV87XpkWg,the only purpose of education these days is to narrow down the selection for getting a good job helping us in life pfft
HndV87XpkWg,great video i look forward to teaching my children these valuable lessons if the current curriculum doesnt go over these important subjects
HndV87XpkWg,great work
HndV87XpkWg,you guys are certainly helping to start the right curriculum
HndV87XpkWg,education is for understanding everything what exists happens and more just for general knowledge and not for giving some competitions which will decide your future
HndV87XpkWg,even after 5 years this is still a thought when will this be implemented i really liked the way the future curriculum was explained in this vid
HndV87XpkWg,im happy when i watch these kind of videos  still there are so many people that cant understand what education really is 
HndV87XpkWg,i love your videos and agree with most of this however if you want to teach kids about money have a class about money but teach math too
HndV87XpkWg,what a wonderful video again the young people will change the system one day and now we now how
HndV87XpkWg,i learnt most of the things mentioned in this video in one way or another in school especially the human mind and relationships with others
HndV87XpkWg,we are wrong children need to be shown how stupid they are our curriculum is wrong we need to teach to avoid the pitfalls
HndV87XpkWg,i love you guys and the problems you approach thank you so much for that 
HndV87XpkWg,apprenticeships give you fantastic experience in the working world and show employers that you can hit the ground running
HndV87XpkWg,thank you for this video
HndV87XpkWg,i want my school to teach defense against dark arts
HndV87XpkWg,wow you emphasized so nicely thank you man
HndV87XpkWg,every one agrees that education is hugely important the thing is we are not particularly sure what we want from it funny as hell
HndV87XpkWg,this is pretty similar to the stuff i learned at school
HndV87XpkWg,some interesting  points madegreat to opening up a debate
HndV87XpkWg,thank you for this video it describes accurately how i feel about the school system we have and how i believe it should be instead
HndV87XpkWg,i ask many people about tge school system and they agree its bad
HndV87XpkWg,i feel like this is a great idea but would be very difficult to implement
HndV87XpkWg,i wish this would be noticed and introduced in any small country and after that exported to the rest of the world
HndV87XpkWg,i approve this message 
HndV87XpkWg,love this video
HndV87XpkWg,amazing contentanimationmessage and thanks for helping me know what is education
HndV87XpkWg,awesome creativity  whoever made this videogreat work u have a vivid imagination
HndV87XpkWg,hi thanks for a great video would it be possible to post the transcript thanks 
HndV87XpkWg,great video if you want to read more about problems with the current education structure in canada make sure to check out this article from the global millennial
HndV87XpkWg,whoever does the animation and illustrations for the school of life is really good his or her stuff is very entertaining to watch
HndV87XpkWg,great video thanks for sharing
HndV87XpkWg,that would be simply ideal choice of education for future improvement
HndV87XpkWg,i would like know what is the new curriculum i mean everyone would need a teacher this teacher knows the skills and likes to can learn
HndV87XpkWg,nice video but unfortionatly it does not point out that education does not necessarily means school and not necessarily a curriculum my idea is that we dont have the
HndV87XpkWg,glad i found this video  u r doing an excellent job
HndV87XpkWg,i could not agree with this more i am grateful the school i work in puts a huge emphasis on self i can see the difference alrady
HndV87XpkWg,all my teachers say is this is what i have been told to teach so how are we to change things
HndV87XpkWg,this is an amazing channel i got a hang of it
HndV87XpkWg,this needs to happen
HndV87XpkWg,i just love this video so so right how did this world get it so wrong
HndV87XpkWg,totally agree i would like to add an important thing to the curriculum namely that of humans relationship with nature and giving a more global outlook
HndV87XpkWg,you know my teachers for many times have told to stop helping other teacher so that you will not regret your results for the exam
HndV87XpkWg,the purpose of education is to empower students to solve problems
HndV87XpkWg,up until
HndV87XpkWg,do you feel the same way for all subjects i found having a degree in music performance very beneficial in many resepects
HndV87XpkWg,so basically it functions like platos academia
HndV87XpkWg,there should be artisan private schools like thisthey probably already exist but ive never heard of one
HndV87XpkWg,thanks for giving a good idea
HndV87XpkWg,you should include economics instead of capitalism i think teaching different economic systems is very important to get a holistic view of how economies can function
5demuSoYzRs,5000mah and 67 watt is a good combination rather than 4400 and 120w
5demuSoYzRs,with the incorporation of the dimensity 8100 soc i think its going to perform well
5demuSoYzRs,looking forward for pro version with bigger battery and 67w charge
5demuSoYzRs,i am bit worried that this phone will effect the price of f4 making that slightly expensive
5demuSoYzRs,i will always prefer bigger battery at relatively slower charging speed for me even 67w is very fast
5demuSoYzRs,according to me bigger battery is great for those who use phone for daily usage
5demuSoYzRs,it will be great to have d8100 in this price rangesurprising
5demuSoYzRs,realme gt neo 3 was also supposed to come around 25k according to chinese price butit came at higher price 
5demuSoYzRs,this feels like a new poco f1
5demuSoYzRs,in some days 60fps in bgmi would be common  which once was dream of a middleclass gamer
5demuSoYzRs,5080mah and 67w charging is good enough also price is low for this variant this combination is good
5demuSoYzRs,i like poco x4 gt and i would definitely consider it if it is made available in india since it comes with the dimensity 8100 chipset
5demuSoYzRs,displayamoled bezel less
5demuSoYzRs,i dont think poco will launch with the same chipset as the chinese model bcz even the poco f4 comes with 870
5demuSoYzRs,i actually prefer battery upto 6000mah  relatively slower charger  like 15w20w
5demuSoYzRs,poco x4 gt seems amazing with the dimensity 8100 processor
5demuSoYzRs,the camera design is from realme gt 2 pro
5demuSoYzRs,the best phone under this category if it will launch in india i am definitely gonna purchase it love your unboxing sir
5demuSoYzRs,5000mah battery and 67 watt charger its good combination  i love  redmi
5demuSoYzRs,around  50 watt is enough with 5000mah because it must run longer rather than charging two three times a day
5demuSoYzRs,i rather prefer weaker and older processors like sd768g but premium amoled display and decent single camera is a must like pixel 4a
5demuSoYzRs,thanks god they have release lcd version  my eyes are pvm sensitive
5demuSoYzRs,the poco x4 gt with 144 hz refresh rate and mediatek d8100 chipset is awesome
5demuSoYzRs,dear xiaomi take 5k or even 10k more but please provide us with an amoled display and imx 766 sensor and a decent telephoto cam please
5demuSoYzRs,the poco x4 pro is a comfortably midrange smartphone with a premium design and highend features including a 667in 120hz amoled display and 67w fast charging  to boot
5demuSoYzRs,will be waiting for a comparison between neo6 and x4
5demuSoYzRs,excellent specs for the price value for money phone indeed
5demuSoYzRs,when it will be launched in india i m going to buy my first phone after 12ththis year under 25k so i m really excited
5demuSoYzRs,5080 and 67 watt best combination
5demuSoYzRs,ill go with bigger battery  and 67 watt fast charging is more than enough to me
5demuSoYzRs,5000mah with 120 watt charger would be amazing
5demuSoYzRs,i think this is the best mid range phone for gaming
5demuSoYzRs,amoled is loveand need in display fingerprint scanner feels flagship
5demuSoYzRs,i will prefer 5080mah  67 watt rather than 4400 mah  120 watt
5demuSoYzRs,for me fast charging should be 30watt is more than enough that will add long lasting battery life
5demuSoYzRs,instead 120hz lcd could have given 90hz amoled
5demuSoYzRs,i respect everyone who were involved in this seriously the best piece that ive ever seen on youtube hats off to well all  love your videos
5demuSoYzRs,what about x4 gt when its coming trakin tech
5demuSoYzRs,if they release 5000mah 67watt for 25000 then it is really worth it and no phone can come close to it for performance
5demuSoYzRs,for me  iqoo neo 6 is best allrounder budget phone 26000
5demuSoYzRs,please make the
5demuSoYzRs,5000mah and 67 watt fast charging are good combination
5demuSoYzRs,definitely 5000 mah battery with 67w charging
5demuSoYzRs,am really happy to see this phone
5demuSoYzRs,personally i love it  this feature phone
5demuSoYzRs,the poco x4 gt is high value for money with the dimensity 8100
5demuSoYzRs,sabse bari baat isme 35 mm jack hai and
5demuSoYzRs,5000 mah and 67 w sounds better zaada fast charger kaafi hai hope they improve the camera with indian launch and it will be quite good phone then even great
5demuSoYzRs,i recomend big battery with med or less fast charging not less than 30 watt
5demuSoYzRs,trakin tech when will it launch in india
5demuSoYzRs,best phone under 30kmy preference is best display battery and processor
5demuSoYzRs,thats phone comes to mi branding i definitely purchase  but poco
5demuSoYzRs,4400 battery is best sir  par sir 5080 battery v best he par  sir dono acha he
5demuSoYzRs,i would perfer sd 870 over dimensity 8100 
5demuSoYzRs,i think 67 watt and 5080 mah is a better option
5demuSoYzRs,was waiting for the successors the the killer dimensity 1200 trio of 2021 that showed the 870 that competition wasnt far
5demuSoYzRs,plz sir compared between one plus nord c2 and relme 9pro  plz sir
5demuSoYzRs,i love your style of reviewing and unboxing
5demuSoYzRs,5080 mah capacity with 67 watt fast charging is beneficial surely
5demuSoYzRs,it will come in the range of around 2829k in india
5demuSoYzRs,why smartphone brands dont give expandable storage especially in midrange or flagship phones
5demuSoYzRs,5000 mah battery with 67 w fast charging is better than 4400 mah with 120 w charging 
5demuSoYzRs,when poco x4 gt will launch in india
5demuSoYzRs,good but i wish it was 90hz amoled instead of 144hz lcd
5demuSoYzRs,5000mah and 66 watt perfect combination
5demuSoYzRs,909 of the comments here be like he never fails to make me laugh his content never disappoint us
5demuSoYzRs,wellmany users are complaining about hardware damage after updates and bugs in ui so how will someone trust this to buy or recommend to others
5demuSoYzRs,can we get snapdragon processor
5demuSoYzRs,i like this redmi not 11t
5demuSoYzRs,which is the best display
5demuSoYzRs,watching phone review  i sleep
5demuSoYzRs,it is coming as redmi k50i i think it will be in the range 25 k
5demuSoYzRs,ips should not be acceptable above 20k price range amoled and 90hz is better for most users
5demuSoYzRs,ill prefer big battery and less power charger
5demuSoYzRs,amoled aur indisplay fingerprint hona chahiye tha
5demuSoYzRs,much needed thank you
5demuSoYzRs,legends want to  big battery big charger
5demuSoYzRs,which is best processor in mtk 8100 and sd 870
5demuSoYzRs,hey actually im going to take a new phone
5demuSoYzRs,waiting for this one
5demuSoYzRs,5000mah and 67 watt is a good combination
5demuSoYzRs,lots of love to you and your team
5demuSoYzRs,very nice video
5demuSoYzRs,your videos are good actually i like your style and the team but  its plz stop purchasing chinese items  you can buy them after it launching in india
5demuSoYzRs,finally kafi time baad ips lcd and flagship processor ke sath koi best phone aaya
5demuSoYzRs,background music is superb
5demuSoYzRs,fast charging dont matter battery backup does if a mobile lasts a whole day then i dont mind charging it during night and use it the next whole day again
01oB5fkT_-Y,i wanna live in whatever fucking nonexisting time this show was set in so bad
01oB5fkT_-Y,anyone else think the casting for adam and michael groff is spot on could genuinely be father and son
01oB5fkT_-Y,i love that they are acting like themselves but at the same time they are acting like their characters its like a bonus episode i love ittttttt
01oB5fkT_-Y,i like how mimi was proudly talking about playing ruby and owning the untouchables bench then we have sami being depressed that eric broke up with him
01oB5fkT_-Y,this has to be one of very few shows that doesnt give a fuck about stereotypes they do what they want and we love it what a show honestly

01oB5fkT_-Y,whats adam like at school

01oB5fkT_-Y,connor wearing a dress and im living for it he looks quite pretty
01oB5fkT_-Y,yall i think they interviewed them by groups like
01oB5fkT_-Y,alistair petrie michael groff is so different to his character hes very energetic funny friendly and silly
01oB5fkT_-Y,i love how sami looked like he was literally about to cry his eyeballs out lol
01oB5fkT_-Y,look im not having your pale unusually long children okay ruby to otis

01oB5fkT_-Y,asa just popping into the background at
01oB5fkT_-Y,it feels weird hearing mimi speaking while dressed as ruby
01oB5fkT_-Y,mimi is such a sweetheart its a huge contrast with rubys personality on the outside shes an amazing actress
01oB5fkT_-Y,the way i just remembered rahims literally rubys unrequited crush back in season 2

01oB5fkT_-Y,its very cool and interesting to see how my favourite show is made i really wanna meet the cast
01oB5fkT_-Y,i love that alstair petrie plays one of the most difficult characters on the show and seems to be the most fun on set
01oB5fkT_-Y,this is really fun to watch its like interviewing the characters not the actors
01oB5fkT_-Y,the contrast on mimi and samis personality is quiet funny hahaha mimi is all so bubbly and proud playing a btch character and sami is definitely rahim irl
01oB5fkT_-Y,love that asa accidentally walked into background shot
01oB5fkT_-Y,when you realise otis house is not a house

gDlo750LINo,i was so confused about the chain malemail 
gDlo750LINo,ive owned that wine saver for about 23 years now  its truly a wonderful item

gDlo750LINo,id love a video where we could see their personal kitchens filled with all these gadgets 
gDlo750LINo,the wine saver we had many of these types of things in the pubs i worked at worked really well normally

XtPSvyPITDU,these are great offerings
XtPSvyPITDU,not a bad month honestly
XtPSvyPITDU,i think this is a great line up since all the games are different types of games  we need this more

XtPSvyPITDU,i love story rich games definitely gonna try dark pictures anthology
XtPSvyPITDU,loved man of medan i just wished that it went free earlier before i bought the game but definitely going to be checking out crash four
XtPSvyPITDU,im happy with crash 4 and man of medan finally something worth downloading
XtPSvyPITDU,its a good game if youre not going for the platinum gets extremely annoying if youre going for it actual solid month in a long time

XtPSvyPITDU,if man of medan is anything like until dawn im super excited to try it
XtPSvyPITDU,nice man of medan been wanting to play that
XtPSvyPITDU,i dont have any of the two games so im actually happy with this upcoming month
XtPSvyPITDU,this is the first time for me that all 3 games are something that im going to play
XtPSvyPITDU,own arcadegeddon already but it is a blast to play will be nice to get more players
XtPSvyPITDU,any idea if more things are being added to extra or premium july love the videos btw always bringing the good news
XtPSvyPITDU,this is a really great line up great job sony
XtPSvyPITDU,ill check out crash  man of medan decent month in my opinion
XtPSvyPITDU,thanks for the update i want to play crash 4 cause the game looked insane even though i still a spyro fan
XtPSvyPITDU,keep it up on your work and this video and channel
XtPSvyPITDU,anxious to see the premium titles for july
XtPSvyPITDU,ive always wanted to buy this crash game yes havent been able to afford it but im happy
XtPSvyPITDU,making crash 4 the ps45 game of the month makes sense since arcadegeddon was put only on ps5 for playstation
XtPSvyPITDU,i already got platinum on crash 4 and it was fucking painful  but i also so happy to see people plays the best platform of all time for me
XtPSvyPITDU,honestly crash is amazing thats should be enough but man of medan is a good game as well
XtPSvyPITDU,been waiting to get crash 4 for a while now cant beat free
XtPSvyPITDU,pretty sure men of medan is on psextra but i agree that it will be a solid month
XtPSvyPITDU,looks like save the world evolved crash 4 ill be happy with
XtPSvyPITDU,hype af for crash 4
XtPSvyPITDU,i appreciate whenever we get 3 different genres
XtPSvyPITDU,great month
XtPSvyPITDU,honestly since i never played the og crash when i tried crash nsane trilogy it beat my ass way too hard for me ik theyre great games tho
XtPSvyPITDU,love yourself first and most
XtPSvyPITDU,that a solid line up i have crash 4 but still a solid month
XtPSvyPITDU,i actually have arcadeageddon its pretty decent game not much direction too it but its was a blast playing solo for the small amount of time i played it
XtPSvyPITDU,im really excited for man of medan
XtPSvyPITDU,i just started until dawn im looking ti to play the rest supermassive games
XtPSvyPITDU,thanks for the awesome monthly games i recommend you sub looks like there making another fortnite looking game
XtPSvyPITDU,theyre great at giving us bs or stuff we already have
XtPSvyPITDU,crash 4 les go
XtPSvyPITDU,crash 4 is actually good  i grew up with crash bandicoot and have played the remasterd of 123
XtPSvyPITDU,i was in gamestop yesterday and i watched somebody buy this
XtPSvyPITDU,crash 4 is a good addition
XtPSvyPITDU,hey if they have crash 4 im all
XtPSvyPITDU,im happy with these games  man of medan is good if you go into it thinking its a corny horror movie to enjoy with a friend
XtPSvyPITDU,could you please start putting time stamps in your description
XtPSvyPITDU,crash 4 was a game that i always wanted to play but didnt want to actually buy so this is a homerun for me 
XtPSvyPITDU,i love crash bandicoot
XtPSvyPITDU,you were a spyro the dragon kid its all making sense now
XtPSvyPITDU,all 3 looks cool for me
XtPSvyPITDU,psplus extra is here and worth it
XtPSvyPITDU,we need aliens fireteam later in the year on ps plus
XtPSvyPITDU,very happy with crash
XtPSvyPITDU,i would love crash 4
XtPSvyPITDU,i tried man of medan because it is on ps extra but for those wondering it is locked at 30fps even on ps5 thats a nono for me
XtPSvyPITDU,crash bandicoot 4 this just made my day
XtPSvyPITDU,dark pictures anthology man of medan is on the games catalogue so more repeats for those who bought ps extra
XtPSvyPITDU,would have preferred house of ashes instead of man of medan
XtPSvyPITDU,is it just me or in the ps plus free game catalog there is always that one iconic game and then the rest are nobodies
XtPSvyPITDU,dark pictures is on extra glad i held out for crash
XtPSvyPITDU,arcadeggedon was an early access game for ppl interested u can look up info on it
XtPSvyPITDU,never played crash gonna try it out
XtPSvyPITDU,id be actually caught up for ps games in july then whew cause i already own and have played these games lol
XtPSvyPITDU,already have access to man of medan on the new ps plus so why would they add it again it makes no sense
XtPSvyPITDU,the ps plus for july is alright its better than june thats for sure
XtPSvyPITDU,didnt have crash decent month
XtPSvyPITDU,i cant wait to play crash on ps5
XtPSvyPITDU,uhhh now i have to plat crash 4 so i can have 100 in all of them    this is going to suck
XtPSvyPITDU,dang games are way to mind this time
XtPSvyPITDU,already have until dawn man of medan little hope house of ashes and the new they game the quarry
XtPSvyPITDU,what about the premium games
XtPSvyPITDU,crash is a good get
XtPSvyPITDU,not into crash but probably will download it already have man of meaden  its good  not interested in the new game
XtPSvyPITDU,i still got my ps4 when it dies thats when ill upgrade to the ps5
XtPSvyPITDU,playstation plus free games have been pretty good in my opinion
XtPSvyPITDU,so playstion got an xbox owned gameactivision for free nice

o58OJJT37Nk,powerful words
o58OJJT37Nk,simon sinek is still highly underrated
o58OJJT37Nk,im 40 and can heavily relate to this the first 2 minutes is so so true the words carried a lot of weight
o58OJJT37Nk,the most important line in this is you deserve the styrofoam cup we would be much happier if we didnt expect to be given so much
o58OJJT37Nk,i really needed to hear something like this i could only see the bagels you could only see the line the best
o58OJJT37Nk,when you said i dont make an impact it felt so relatable
o58OJJT37Nk,didnt want this video to end
o58OJJT37Nk,somebody realized
o58OJJT37Nk,awesome love this guy
o58OJJT37Nk,nobody who does wrong by you  takes responsibility  the new way is explaining what went wrong  with no reconspence  at all  ever  
o58OJJT37Nk,great speech
o58OJJT37Nk,thank you for the powerful speech  i watched it twice
o58OJJT37Nk,thank you i benefit a lot i want to add turkish subtitles if you allow me to do that so much more people can benefit from it
o58OJJT37Nk,i know its a good advice but most of people dont have the choice most are lucky enough to have a job and its really a blessing nowadays
o58OJJT37Nk,always learn from daily basis and focus on your dreams
o58OJJT37Nk,do anythingeverything with passion or dont do it at all
o58OJJT37Nk,absolutely mind blowing
o58OJJT37Nk,simon the guy with all this leadership knowledge who hasnt actually led anyone
o58OJJT37Nk,these advices are on par with if you are sad dont be sad
o58OJJT37Nk,crazy im going through this right now started in 2019
o58OJJT37Nk,another great video thank you for your time and effort
o58OJJT37Nk,great point to be kept in mind and heart
o58OJJT37Nk,this got goosebumps
o58OJJT37Nk,if there is a guy that is best at judging the value of other peoples life it is simon  cowell
o58OJJT37Nk,can you imagine your without simon sineks wisdom
o58OJJT37Nk,phenomenal this video blew me away
o58OJJT37Nk,simon sneak u are my inspiration
o58OJJT37Nk,what did simon achieve other than making  motivational videos
o58OJJT37Nk,lovely speaker
o58OJJT37Nk,so glad i watched this before turning 40
o58OJJT37Nk,dont regret dudemost of the valuable learnings come at or after the age 40
o58OJJT37Nk,can some one enlighten me simons story about retired undersecretary what is he trying to imply what rule is it thanks
o58OJJT37Nk,dont waste your time with a company like caesars palace and try to make an impact go to a place like four seasons and flourish
o58OJJT37Nk,life doesnt begin for men until 40 the first 40 years are just research
o58OJJT37Nk,those simple truths sound a little too simple to me i would add some nuances for instance 
o58OJJT37Nk,very good thank you although i didnt understand the part about the ceramic and styrofoam cup
o58OJJT37Nk,secret usually youre always the problem  ego can masquerade  shape shift be very wary
o58OJJT37Nk,regarding the barista noah  sounds like a great barista but hes mostlikely a great leader too hes a barista but hes a leader in his attitude and his work life
o58OJJT37Nk,i watched this with my dog and my dog just open the door and walk by himself and back
o58OJJT37Nk,thy 4 your wisdom thats true what you say  very good video 
o58OJJT37Nk,bro he just didnt want the bagel as much as you did he didnt want to waste his time for something that isnt worth it
o58OJJT37Nk,i feel like a noah at a caesars palace
o58OJJT37Nk,the bagels analogy is
o58OJJT37Nk,1  free bagel vs long line  just a cost benefit analysis  for some its worth the wait  for others no  nothing special
o58OJJT37Nk,this is a great video
o58OJJT37Nk,this is basic common sense thank god for it
NnfrYz2MU7o,i dont think the first episode of dusk is very engaging watching everyone learn both an entirely new rpg and a whole new vtt platform is a lot

zDZFcDGpL4U,as a new teacher this video really inspires me to make a difference in my own school it wont be easy definitely but the idea is there
zDZFcDGpL4U,12 years had passed and i still see no need for revisions what a great talk and actually quite prophetic rip sir ken robinson
zDZFcDGpL4U,im watching in 2020 10 years later and i feel like theres still no change 
zDZFcDGpL4U,rip to this legendary genius thank you ken for everything you taught us
zDZFcDGpL4U,i found this very interesting and as someone with adhdi i had a lot of hyperfocused thoughts about it
zDZFcDGpL4U,rest in piece sir ken robinson i doubt that without you we are going to achieve a change in our education
zDZFcDGpL4U,well done creativity is underrated in schools  not just for students but for teachers too this is a great clip
zDZFcDGpL4U,so much truth in one video
zDZFcDGpL4U,this man needs a noble prize
zDZFcDGpL4U,i watch this every now and then for inspiration love the kids and profession if not necessarily the system
zDZFcDGpL4U,we love this thank you sir ken thank you for bringing light and awareness to this i wish you were still with usbut hey all your work still is
zDZFcDGpL4U,rip sir ken i used to use this when i first started teaching
zDZFcDGpL4U,this video made me think about how education has
zDZFcDGpL4U,i absolutely love this video my ag teacher showed this to me last year and i have told so many people about this it really makes so much sense
zDZFcDGpL4U,one of my all time heroes rip sir ken
zDZFcDGpL4U,who else is watching this for school
zDZFcDGpL4U,being quite divergent  creative myself my child has been taught this way since age 5 and the results are astounding but be ready to be challenged often excellent video 
zDZFcDGpL4U,great thoughts i enjoy listening to sir ken robinson many times in the past and this time is no exception
zDZFcDGpL4U,well delivered loved it hopefully the wheels of transformation will persist to push for a more learner centered approach to education in public schools
zDZFcDGpL4U,very well illustrated and is certainly food for thought thoughts about the way we box in students into believing they are not smart if they are not academically inclined
zDZFcDGpL4U,the list of flaws with standard model of education is incredibly long and the severity of the flaws is extremely significant
zDZFcDGpL4U,promoting education is an effort that is close to my heart illiteracy contributes to poverty encouraging children to pick up a book is fundamental
zDZFcDGpL4U,this guy is  absolutely fascinating and enlightening to listen to and watch will definitely be giving more of my time to hear him out
zDZFcDGpL4U,excellent timeless and so true love to see the curse of education preventing us from being innovative and think outofthebox and true unbiased seeing without constraints or preprogrammed concepts
zDZFcDGpL4U,i love the visuals in this  it helps people who are visual learners to grasp the ideas he spoke super easily
zDZFcDGpL4U,this was amazing you exposed ideas which i had in my mind great video
zDZFcDGpL4U,this helped consolidate many of my floating ideas on education as well as shine light on valuable new information thank you i really appreciated the animation as well
zDZFcDGpL4U,we watched this in sociology and he makes excellent points definitely food for thought 
zDZFcDGpL4U,wow shout out to my professor for introducing me to this video it was great definitely a brain teaser
zDZFcDGpL4U,well said and well shown impressive coordination between idea and aesthetic all on a topic with a lot of heart
zDZFcDGpL4U,it never gets old  i am uncertain if that is a testament to the message or failure of society to grasp it
zDZFcDGpL4U,i use this clip in my high school sociology elective  his book the element how finding your passion changes everything is worth reading as well
zDZFcDGpL4U,great video talk and drawings rsa largely inspirational love it
zDZFcDGpL4U,rip sir ken you truly inspired me and will continue to do so throughout my teaching career
zDZFcDGpL4U,i remember my 4th and 5th grade teacher showing my class this video many years ago oddly makes me very nostalgic
zDZFcDGpL4U,this is still one of the most wonderful presentations that i constantly share  ahem  coming from a creative person that is 
zDZFcDGpL4U,fully alive   arts and aesthetic experience
zDZFcDGpL4U,loved it
zDZFcDGpL4U,this is still relevant even today good job on the presentation
zDZFcDGpL4U,sir ken robinson nails it a great insight he imparts for everyone but especially parents
zDZFcDGpL4U,it would be so great to have such an animation in german language  fantastic illustration of wise words
zDZFcDGpL4U,absolutely spectacular so where can i find the alternative i want to build this new way of education id love to be part of it
zDZFcDGpL4U,the revolution and framework for change is in place  now the educators and their policy makers need to recognize and implement the new paradigm
zDZFcDGpL4U,this puts into words so eloquently what the education system needs to be like
zDZFcDGpL4U,i wish i could get this summary in drawing its great and the ideas are thought provoking
zDZFcDGpL4U,this is the only educational video that i watched on will super well made and thought out
zDZFcDGpL4U,i literally thought i was alone until my friend sent me this video i feel enlightened and more motivated

DFjkHnZCqmU,i dont think were doing anything for the super bowl this year but i still wanna make all this

DFjkHnZCqmU,its crazy how josh cut himself in the least dangerous part of handling a knife
DFjkHnZCqmU,made the wings for the game today and they were insanely amazing this whole spread looks killer too

DFjkHnZCqmU,the sandwich looks like it should be in a commercial i love it so much
DFjkHnZCqmU,would you ever consider doing an airfryer series i feel like so many people would love that content because of all the hype around airfryers myself included
DFjkHnZCqmU,those wings  korean bbq has been my favorite wing flavor for years so ill be trying that recipe
DFjkHnZCqmU,im going to try this thanks josh
DFjkHnZCqmU,those knots look got damn amazing
DFjkHnZCqmU,i really like watching your videos because unlike a lot of other chefs you are very organised and find ways to add even more flavour
DFjkHnZCqmU,yum did something similar to this but with vastly different foods for my birthday and it was amazing
DFjkHnZCqmU,omg that glorious food  i can feel the crispiness of those chicken just looking at it
DFjkHnZCqmU,these videos make me appreciate myself more for discovering you josh
DFjkHnZCqmU,made the garlic knots with dinner delicious
DFjkHnZCqmU,can we all take a moment and appreciate the edittingtimingchoice of sound used when the flour missed the bowl
DFjkHnZCqmU,this looks incredible i love cooking so 3 hours is nothing for me but for people who hate to cook this would be a nightmare lmao
DFjkHnZCqmU,the part where you sung  which is an enzyme to soften the doughhh i loved it with the little bread graphics youre dope af glad i found your channel
DFjkHnZCqmU,amazing only other thing i would love to see you do is your spin on a chunky pico salsa for the chips you the man

JR3z8lq2cNM,i get very confused when people mention that ive already worn an outfit as if washing machines dont exist
JR3z8lq2cNM,dont follow trends wear what looks good on you and makes you feel good having your own style is important
JR3z8lq2cNM,true sustainability is about consuming less
JR3z8lq2cNM,i worked in a charity shop during the summer and the amount of shein summer clothes that came in after the summer ended was crazy 
JR3z8lq2cNM,wearing 2nd hand clothes is considered sustainable if youre well off but its frowned upon if youre poor 
JR3z8lq2cNM,a quote that i enjoy is the most anti capitalist thing you can do is find your own identity that way you cant be sold a new one every month
JR3z8lq2cNM,judging others for dressing out of style is so tacky
JR3z8lq2cNM,i still wear dresses that i bought 20 years ago whats wrong with a well built good quality simple black dress  nothing its all good
JR3z8lq2cNM,aesthetics are amazing theyre like mini cultures and i love them
JR3z8lq2cNM,there is a large difference between loving fashion and loving the acceptance that comes with following trends
JR3z8lq2cNM,i love completely ignoring trends its so fun
JR3z8lq2cNM,the question is not why is this shirt 30 the question is why doesnt the system of capitalism pay me enough to clothe myself without exploiting another worker
JR3z8lq2cNM,who throws away their clothing unless its completely tattered im giving it to a thrift store a friend or using the fabric for something else
JR3z8lq2cNM,this is one of the reasons why im grateful my mom always made sure that we donated clothes we didnt wear anymore before we bought new ones
JR3z8lq2cNM,1000 seems inexpensive considering all that went into the lingerie set
JR3z8lq2cNM,shein is the last thing we needed in this polluted world this whole movement is going to cause so much environmental impact in less time than we think
JR3z8lq2cNM,i wish people bought clothes that genuinely make them happy instead of trying to satisfy a trend theyre totally allowed to do the latter but come on now
JR3z8lq2cNM,now even shops that label themselves as thrift stores are getting regular used clothes and selling them for 25 bucks more than the original price
JR3z8lq2cNM,cosplaying as the most popular girl in school is basically the best description of this phenomenon ive heard
JR3z8lq2cNM,low income people are not the ones keeping fast fashion brands afloat yes yes yes
JR3z8lq2cNM,more internet voices like yours are needed pointing this kind of issues your sight is soooo helpful and makes me always think beyond
JR3z8lq2cNM,this was a really thoughtful progressive and nonreactionary take on fast fashion  thank you
JR3z8lq2cNM,this was a very interesting video and you are amazingly clearsighted about environmental consequences and where to lay the blame not on poor people thanks
JR3z8lq2cNM,trying to find plus sized sustainable clothing is basically impossible
JR3z8lq2cNM,idk if its just me but id rather get 1 sweater that im going to wear everyday all year then 6 that im never going to wear at all
JR3z8lq2cNM,the thought of throwing away a perfectly wearable item of clothing is absolutely alien and obscene to me
JR3z8lq2cNM,youre my favorite youtuber i love that you do your research and go in depth from where these issues come from
JR3z8lq2cNM,i loved this video and since i love this topic so much there is 2 things i want to share just because
JR3z8lq2cNM,love this so realistic and understanding both sides and providing alot of facts
JR3z8lq2cNM,this is probably one of the most informative videoes i have ever watched and then its about something i really care about
JR3z8lq2cNM,unpopular opinion but every tiktok fashion trend ends up revolving around being skinny
JR3z8lq2cNM,im so happy more people are talking about fashion waste and how we should reuse clothing and be more environmentally friendly
JR3z8lq2cNM,imagine having 1000 dollars to spend on clothes and buying stuff on shein ugh also what could possibly be more shallow than criticizing people for wearing outdated clothing
JR3z8lq2cNM,thank you for explaining to this to me fortunately i dont have the income or wastefulness to be a problem

dwSQAadTyIU,at high school our aussie rules team thrashed the basketball team at basketball but they wouldnt play us in aussie rules
dwSQAadTyIU,this is the first time ive seen a non nrlspecific compilation do the nrl justice well done
dwSQAadTyIU,this is a good watch shows aussie sports really are that good
dwSQAadTyIU,love the content in the cricket season can you do funniest bbl moments pls include when the umpire went to call out but he ended up itching his nose
dwSQAadTyIU,this video sends shivers down my spine on all sports
dwSQAadTyIU,as an american i find aussie sports more exciting
dwSQAadTyIU,eddie betts just makes the video so much better
dwSQAadTyIU,that striker catch is just legendary
dwSQAadTyIU,aussies are the best and im a aussie
dwSQAadTyIU,that greg inglis try gives me goosebumps
dwSQAadTyIU,that was an amazing compilation fantastic stuff afl is my favourite
dwSQAadTyIU,i loved all these highlights awesome to watch
dwSQAadTyIU,as an american afl fan i have tried to convince others that it is quite similar to basketball
dwSQAadTyIU,fun fact 90 of the comments are from aussies
dwSQAadTyIU,actually cricket and rugby are english sports granted australia are good at beating the english at their own sports
dwSQAadTyIU,who wouldve thought that professional sportsmen across the world had similar skillsets 0o
dwSQAadTyIU,i still laugh every time i see that chris lynn shot
dwSQAadTyIU,how havent u hit 100k subs yet with all that quality content mate
dwSQAadTyIU,great video loved it
dwSQAadTyIU,what a vid brother awesome stuff
dwSQAadTyIU,as much as i enjoy american sports such as the nfl and the nba australian rules football is just godly
dwSQAadTyIU,next you should do americans playing aussie sports and aussies playing american sports
dwSQAadTyIU,awesome stuff
dwSQAadTyIU,sheese gotta be in one of the best videos well done mate
dwSQAadTyIU,australia has good sport event like footy cricket ruby
dwSQAadTyIU,amazing wat mainstream publicity can do and a few inches of pads ofc im joking but afl is undoubtedly the most underrated sport in history
dwSQAadTyIU,australia win cricket world cup 5 time
dwSQAadTyIU,as a cricket fan i must say baseball is equally fun its like watching a good test match unfolding in about three hours
dwSQAadTyIU,as a south asian im with australian sports my cousin lives in america so i know american sports are fking boring
dwSQAadTyIU,american sports focus on specialist roles while australian sports focus on a broad skill range if you dont understand this you cant even comprehend the appeal of both sport types
dwSQAadTyIU,all sports have these moments if you are willing to find them
dwSQAadTyIU,afl is the best sport ever cricket a close second
dwSQAadTyIU,great comparisons nfl and nrl are my favorites
dwSQAadTyIU,great job
dwSQAadTyIU,aussies are good
dwSQAadTyIU,okay there is a clear factor here australian sports have such thrilling commentators
dwSQAadTyIU,for someone who isnt from australia but wants to follow the big bash league  does something similar to the afl livepass exist
dwSQAadTyIU,i love this i love footy
dwSQAadTyIU,many gridiron players never touch the ball or kick it
dwSQAadTyIU,how benji marshall didnt get a mention on this list is beyond me
dwSQAadTyIU,eddie takes the ball out of bounds at 249
dwSQAadTyIU,i love the nflbut i dont take that much  notice of catches like objs cause the gloves they wear are like glue the ball just sticks to them
dwSQAadTyIU,great vid mate
dwSQAadTyIU,hey aussie next you should do soccer vs afl or any sport vs afl worst injurys would be interesting
dwSQAadTyIU,straya on top
dwSQAadTyIU,can you do good mullet moments or tricks on you moments
dwSQAadTyIU,apart from afl rugby and cricket are british sports
dwSQAadTyIU,so many of these plays were against my teams 
dwSQAadTyIU,australian rules football is king the most underrated sport in the world
dwSQAadTyIU,maybe compare alfie langer waddling to tiger woods scurrying
dwSQAadTyIU,the riewoldt mark epitomises what afl used to be like put your body on the line for your team unfortunately you dont see anything like that now
dwSQAadTyIU,australian sports plus paddinghelmets minus cardio  american sports
dwSQAadTyIU,nrl easily the best
dwSQAadTyIU,as a pom i would point out that cricket and rugby league are english sports played by australians
dwSQAadTyIU,how does the gabba have all the good cricket highlights
dwSQAadTyIU,i love tackles in the nrl
dwSQAadTyIU,shows the nz warriors in a strayan compilation chur
dwSQAadTyIU,the australian sports are best by faaaaaaaaaaaaaar
dwSQAadTyIU,afl most underrated sport in the world
dwSQAadTyIU,rugby league is an unaustralian sport most aussies hate it its a regional league at best
dwSQAadTyIU,excellent clip
dwSQAadTyIU,you should do an afl vs soccer and show the diving against the massive hits
dwSQAadTyIU,how is it possible that australians can tackle hard without padding and can catch hard balls without gloves thats because we are australian not american
dwSQAadTyIU,aus wins and im american so that is saying something
dwSQAadTyIU,up up cronulla
dwSQAadTyIU,all these sports are good but the best are aussies sports
dwSQAadTyIU,im excited for a great video
dwSQAadTyIU,australia best sports country
dwSQAadTyIU,do ozzies and usa citizens not play soccer tennis hockey rugby union
dwSQAadTyIU,afl and my favourite player is  jack darling
dwSQAadTyIU,sick video
dwSQAadTyIU,ye ye great vid
dwSQAadTyIU,australian sport
dwSQAadTyIU,afl is the best sport
dwSQAadTyIU,cricket afl nba
dwSQAadTyIU,someone answer this  the us has a national comp but the winner calls them selves world champs what right do they have to say that
dwSQAadTyIU,yo great video
dwSQAadTyIU,afl and cricket
dwSQAadTyIU,aussie rulesbiggest game in oz
dwSQAadTyIU,only good thing about american sports is its cheerleaderslolnah im a baseball and nba fan lol but our rugby league is hands down the best sport in the world
dwSQAadTyIU,mark waugh you beauty 
dwSQAadTyIU,guess how many gridiron players touch the ball
dwSQAadTyIU,australia cus i live here
dwSQAadTyIU,you gotta love rugby league or even afl

uBZhjmYRWfg,click here for more news on the supreme court
uBZhjmYRWfg,so apparently unelected executive branch bureaucrats cant make law after all i guess congress might have to do something else going forward besides political posturing
uBZhjmYRWfg,congress change immigration laws so that asylum seekers have to apply at their home country thereby allowing border patrol to do their intended job
uBZhjmYRWfg,this opens up the atf to be taken down an administrative agency dosent have the right to make laws only enforce them
uBZhjmYRWfg,i appreciate that cbs admits this is obamas 3rd term
uBZhjmYRWfg,or perhaps a major influence on a constitutional right should go through the congress too  atf and nfa interpretations is next to go
uBZhjmYRWfg,never mind  stay in mexico to process your asylum claim
uBZhjmYRWfg,now time for scotus to review the atf
uBZhjmYRWfg,jeanluc godard said a long time ago that the american people went to barbarism to decay without ever knowing civilization so he was right after all
uBZhjmYRWfg,it means that a government agency can not through regulation do what only congress has the authority to do under the constitution
uBZhjmYRWfg,wowwww so the supreme court doesnt want to do congresses jobdirty work for them who knew
uBZhjmYRWfg,so much crazy news lately is nice to see them cover this today its super important
uBZhjmYRWfg,the irony is that the politicians who will cry the loudest about this are the ones who created this problem by not doing their jobs in the first place
uBZhjmYRWfg,mutability of government ever heard of that they actually prevented the mutability of government by design maybe we should refresh ourselves why we should not have mutable government
uBZhjmYRWfg,term limits for all elected and swamp bureaucrats lets go brandon i agree
uBZhjmYRWfg,we dont want any of them to be in control of anything
uBZhjmYRWfg,seems like something needs to be done about the 3 justices who regularly ignore the constitution in favor of the political leanings of a particular party
uBZhjmYRWfg,god bless this court
uBZhjmYRWfg,immigration laws vs a presidents policy  congress needs to codify in law our immigration laws
uBZhjmYRWfg,is not just a color of a person but it is for your careers for what you have completed study or your qualifications
uBZhjmYRWfg,sounds like its so pollutions can keep making tons of money of the energy companies
uBZhjmYRWfg,so glad they are respecting precedent and taking their partisan axe long settled decisions corporate rights over individual rights the true american way
uBZhjmYRWfg,the epa never had authority we give that power to the house and senate not unelected officials
uBZhjmYRWfg,im honestly surprised some of the judges sided with bureaucracy
uBZhjmYRWfg,why is the remain in mexico teaser headline so intentionally misleading when the first seven minutes is all about the clean air act legislation
uBZhjmYRWfg,why arent you including the jarkesy v sec decision in this discussion
uBZhjmYRWfg,why do we deceive ourselves to think that a stable society is possible when we identify ourselves with a political ideologyconservative or liberal why dont leaders see this
uBZhjmYRWfg,agencies are not lawmakers
uBZhjmYRWfg,aft should take notes
uBZhjmYRWfg,supreme court justices must have reevaluation on those who are not following the rules of their court
uBZhjmYRWfg,if you are for this decision then you should have to live near these power plants and drink the water from the area
uBZhjmYRWfg,now work on the irs among other non legislative agencies that think they get to make laws
uBZhjmYRWfg,because they never had the authority the decision was correct good job supreme court
uBZhjmYRWfg,taking power from unelected goons and handing it to congress sounds like a win for democracy
uBZhjmYRWfg,that roe decision was a rouge now we are getting to why those justices were really picked
uBZhjmYRWfg,just answer the question exjudge
uBZhjmYRWfg,remain in mexico
uBZhjmYRWfg,finally we have a supreme court that pays attention to the constitution
uBZhjmYRWfg,so thankful for some sanity finally
uBZhjmYRWfg,when will they get to healthcare decisions  this is also where they want to go
uBZhjmYRWfg,great job brandon just add this to his long list of failures lets go brandon
uBZhjmYRWfg,we have traders in the supreme court as well
uBZhjmYRWfg,thats awesome epa crap has started affecting motor sports but not anymore ha
uBZhjmYRWfg,i dont think the supreme court likes the american people much
uBZhjmYRWfg,what is so wrong in getting naturalized in the usa  my white grandmother did it in 1943  so are there two sets of rules
uBZhjmYRWfg,liberals last weekthe supreme court must be expanded with liberal justices by ruling this way on roe v wade the conservative justices are illegitimate
uBZhjmYRWfg,next is health care then social security what a country
uBZhjmYRWfg,seriously i dont believe anyone cares what the court has to say any more
uBZhjmYRWfg,too many newscasters keep saying the obama administration
uBZhjmYRWfg,the supreme court seems to be doing a clean sweep for republican donors
uBZhjmYRWfg,shout out to george floyd on 2 years of sobriety it took some tough love but he did it say his name liberals
uBZhjmYRWfg,good common sense
uBZhjmYRWfg,this guy confusing ideology with adherence to the constitution is amusing

o24lMCt0GvM,ive seen so many people being unbiased when it comes to this messironaldo thing but rio isnt one of them i just love how he appreciate both of them
o24lMCt0GvM,brilliant piece of punditry by larsson here described perfectly
o24lMCt0GvM,messi magician
o24lMCt0GvM,10 minutes of ferdinand loving messi and ronaldo
o24lMCt0GvM,messi most complete playerfootballer ever cr7 most complete athlete ever others dont come close careerachievement wise and both have a ridiculous goal return goats
o24lMCt0GvM,were so greatful to be born in this era
o24lMCt0GvM,love how the video ends with messi
o24lMCt0GvM,amazing video two amazing players the only part i would have cut out was the last comment when rio was praising messi after the liverpool first leg lololol
o24lMCt0GvM,lets give this man huge respect
o24lMCt0GvM,when people mention ronaldo they say talented messi gifted and on the pitch one is clearly better than the other
o24lMCt0GvM,klopp got the last smile in after that last game
o24lMCt0GvM,there are great and top players but both of them are defining era players
o24lMCt0GvM,after almost 23 years we are going to witness the actual el classico
o24lMCt0GvM,now compare these guys to those espn clowns that are evidently biased
o24lMCt0GvM,messi best footballer ever
o24lMCt0GvM,ronaldo does it to show the physique
o24lMCt0GvM,loved it when rio says i wish
o24lMCt0GvM,i love the fact that theres a possibility that lionel messi and cristiano ronaldo have watched this video
o24lMCt0GvM,i think messi and ronaldo friends lowkey love each other we family cause at the end of the day they both up there
o24lMCt0GvM,messi was born to play this game
o24lMCt0GvM,messi is more pleasing to the eyes
o24lMCt0GvM,its a shame that these guys won nothing with the three lions
o24lMCt0GvM,its mad to think that this will probably be the last time we see them play against each other
o24lMCt0GvM,waxing lyrical  tim westwoods great grandad
o24lMCt0GvM,sir alex is greatest manager of all timebut his comment on ronaldo doing it stockport and messi unable to do it is laughable
o24lMCt0GvM,the biggest rivalry in history only messi and ronaldo
o24lMCt0GvM,harrowk is officially great
o24lMCt0GvM,imagine if they ever played together
o24lMCt0GvM,two gods of the game we should appreciate them as much as we can before they retire
o24lMCt0GvM,2017 chiellini is aging
o24lMCt0GvM,ferdinand is ronaldos biggest hypeman
o24lMCt0GvM,cristiano ronaldo and lionel messi personification of greatness
o24lMCt0GvM,will be a sad day for football when they both retire the game wont be the same
o24lMCt0GvM,this will be the last time we ever going to see messi and ronaldo face each other
o24lMCt0GvM,this is beautiful
o24lMCt0GvM,rio nursing a full on stonker under the desk talking about messi
o24lMCt0GvM,this was a really well made clip
o24lMCt0GvM,rio still as nightmares about 2011
o24lMCt0GvM,messi goat
o24lMCt0GvM,its a dream to see portugal vs argentina in finals of world cup   2022 is the last of theirs  just hope it happens
o24lMCt0GvM,portsmouth free kick is his best goal no doubt
o24lMCt0GvM,just enjoy them man  correct
o24lMCt0GvM,in reality in terms pure footballing ability messi shouldnt be compared to cr7 he should be compared to maradona r9 pele cruyff etc
o24lMCt0GvM,i think ronaldo should go psg or bayern after this season to win another title
o24lMCt0GvM,that last scene of messis footage while ferdinand was giving credit to him u just smile knowing what happened in the 2nd leg kapowww barcelona
o24lMCt0GvM,i respect cr as an athlete but hes lucky to be compared to the genius of messi
o24lMCt0GvM,cr7 and messi the best footballer ever
o24lMCt0GvM,only legends know that last clip is from ucl semi 3o against lfc little did they know
o24lMCt0GvM,imagine a champions league final with juventus vs barcelona 
o24lMCt0GvM,player of big leaguesucl uefa eurocopa americaworld cup ronaldo
o24lMCt0GvM,all this hype about messi and ronaldo and in the end neither of them will score
o24lMCt0GvM,gonna be a sad sad day when these guys retire
o24lMCt0GvM,i wish i could get there
o24lMCt0GvM,rip maradona
o24lMCt0GvM,the background music is amazing
o24lMCt0GvM,rio is the main man on bt sport
o24lMCt0GvM,cr7 just obsessed with goals he literally add little to the game
o24lMCt0GvM,messi messi messi
o24lMCt0GvM,i just mentally replace the words messi and ronaldo with lingard and jlingz and the punditry is more realistics
o24lMCt0GvM,im begging the owners of psg make our dreams come through sign both of them
o24lMCt0GvM,gerrard clever pockets wtf
o24lMCt0GvM,deep down they know messis levels above everyone else they just dont want to receive any backlash for saying it
o24lMCt0GvM,messi not 52  57
o24lMCt0GvM,a player with messis footballing skills and ronaldo with his mentality

eFhhW6fsAbQ,id love to have the money to do this
eFhhW6fsAbQ,gotta learn that home row for typing
eFhhW6fsAbQ,as a heads up the steam deck has a strap to lift it rather than the joy stick

ECDsT0hZo14,good learning experience for chet he kinda got owned by lofton jr in the paint
ECDsT0hZo14,okc is good in passing
ECDsT0hZo14,i hope segu earns g league spot at least after all the years of watching him
ECDsT0hZo14,that big fella is good i hope  memphis will land him a contract
ECDsT0hZo14,grizzles should have zbo come down and train lofton good god that is scary
ECDsT0hZo14,kenny lofton jr is doing the work for his career
ECDsT0hZo14,when these players has much hype than the top 3 of draft 2022
ECDsT0hZo14,lofton gave chet a lesson in body control tonight wow
ECDsT0hZo14,kenny lofton jr remember the name
ECDsT0hZo14,okc will definitely have some length in different lineups
ECDsT0hZo14,okc with the passes yeesh i enjoyed loftons game too
ECDsT0hZo14,kenneth lofton jr
ECDsT0hZo14,kenny just needs to be more conditioned and chet needs more conditioning and a little bit more strength and theyll both be really good talent
ECDsT0hZo14,memphis got something special with lofton jr
ECDsT0hZo14,kenny loftons gonna be fun to watch
ECDsT0hZo14,josh giddy is gonna be a star and he will get a ring someday as a champion he will sign with the warriors when he is done with okc
ECDsT0hZo14,lofton like a mini charles barkley out there
ECDsT0hZo14,ken lofton jr is a lottery pick material
ECDsT0hZo14,lofton great pick from grizie this year
ECDsT0hZo14,lofton looks like he outweigh chet and poku combined hes like a nonexplosive zion but more versatile offensively
ECDsT0hZo14,oklahama did well on drafting giddy never thought hell be this good this early
ECDsT0hZo14,damn josh giddey is such a gifted passer
ECDsT0hZo14,kenny lofton reminds me of zach randolph nice pick

ECDsT0hZo14,kenny lofton jr is my fav player in the sumer leauge hes a steal 4 the grizleys
ECDsT0hZo14,chet getting pushed around down low like hes made of paper
ECDsT0hZo14,against bigger opponent in the nba i cant see holmgrem dominate in the paint except outside holmgrem will be hard to guard
ECDsT0hZo14,chet is truly unique
ECDsT0hZo14,lofton the new charles barkley  gonna love to see him look like barkley for his career
ECDsT0hZo14,cant wait to see holmgren vs adams
ECDsT0hZo14,im mad they dont do top 10 anymore for summer league
ECDsT0hZo14,kenny lofton jr is great
ECDsT0hZo14,lofton such a bucket
ECDsT0hZo14,memphis grizzlies 71 vs 87 oklahoma city thunder
ECDsT0hZo14,you can see how curry have changed the game when you see this kids are shooting 3s like butter
ECDsT0hZo14,expect to see nba players body up chet right under the basket he is too light inside
ECDsT0hZo14,im amazed how 7 footer now are shooting 3s
ECDsT0hZo14,i guess chet going to cower at 3pt line every game
ECDsT0hZo14,kenny kelo loften jr congrats on making the league
ECDsT0hZo14,lofton toyed holmgren
ECDsT0hZo14,but how does this affect lebrons legacy
ECDsT0hZo14,chet got abused and literally got ran over by lofton wow one butt check from lofton and hes getting moved 2 feet back
ECDsT0hZo14,ayyye these usa u19 boyz from last year going at it
ECDsT0hZo14,chets defense was exposed by lofton imagine giannis dray or bron doing it to chet lol
ECDsT0hZo14,lofton needs to get in shape the talent is there but he should base his game around mid range instead of lurking at the three points and rebounds await
ECDsT0hZo14,if zion williamson 1v1 him it will be
ECDsT0hZo14,chet needs to put on muscle man he was getting bodied by kenny imagine the real big men like embid
ECDsT0hZo14,chet got bullied by this knock off charles barkley lmao he finna snap when he goes up against the top centers in the nba
ECDsT0hZo14,undrafted player vs no 2 draft pick morant got a steal
ECDsT0hZo14,man if kenny can lose some pounds he can legit be a charles barkley 20 with all due respect to sir charles
ECDsT0hZo14,lofton jr reminds me of barkley
ECDsT0hZo14,lofton jr

16-M4xR9zr0,the swedish a26 would be an excellent submarine for australian waters and its a fraction of the cost of a nuclear sub
16-M4xR9zr0,aukus deal would result in australia being a major hub for usuk nuclear submarines armed with nuclear weapons
16-M4xR9zr0,australia is also considering whether to buy another light aircraft carrier from spain navantia company and some f100 or f110 destroyers turkey too
16-M4xR9zr0,never new it was this close and serious thank you for the info and yes we should be worried
16-M4xR9zr0,the fact is we need the subs and we would get them faster if they were built offshore this self reliance is bit of a furphy
16-M4xR9zr0,im inclined to agree  hi tech weapons and satellitedigital interference etc might be the better route
16-M4xR9zr0,most of the these deals happen just before quitting they require free time to enjoy the bribe
16-M4xR9zr0,yesplease to maintain stability with indonesiaif australian keep wanting the submarine then indonesia will automatically become chinas ally which is i dont think australia would like that either
16-M4xR9zr0,keep in mind if someone focuses on something like this for 35 years theyre more than likely going to be a little more paranoid of something like this happening lol
16-M4xR9zr0,australia could buy a couple not so new pickled subs that could be refitted instead of waiting for new ones
16-M4xR9zr0,a day without comedy is a day wasted  elensky
16-M4xR9zr0,australia should not be dragged into the unjust war of us weaponization
16-M4xR9zr0,a day without begging the west for more himars is a day wasted  zelenksy
16-M4xR9zr0,is a matter of choice the australian have to choose either to become a warlord or not
16-M4xR9zr0,hi tech arms arent exactly a deterrent mate 
16-M4xR9zr0,were australia  no longer the pacific most promising power underabanesewhom binding to chinawere the  aukus and quad be scrapped under the albenese govt
16-M4xR9zr0,australia needs to inevitably have both capabilities but time is the factor in what they need now
16-M4xR9zr0,remember when russia was running out of missiles funny times
16-M4xR9zr0,everybody is ignoring the fact that it is currently
16-M4xR9zr0,the simple answer could have been that well definitely discuss this issue internally and were willing to help in whatever we can do
16-M4xR9zr0,aukus the best deal for australia  the new government have to be  smart 
16-M4xR9zr0,australia should probably stick with the french diesel subs leave the nuclear to the big dogs
16-M4xR9zr0,scrap it
16-M4xR9zr0,oh shoot  a nuke sub is not hitech

KxLJRAqUUeQ,good job on bring starlight glimmer and sunset shimmer theyre elements of harmony
8ZhoeSaPF-k,thank you so much i was in need of this
8ZhoeSaPF-k,i love the part where they talk about the control of your destiny and then words on screen read internal locus of control never have motivation
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,hearing people actually believe that this is due to incompetence is unreal this is intentional power makes humans insane
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,tim dont be afraid to be called a conspiracy theorist you and i both know it is 100 man made
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,inflation hits an
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,a culling is intentional tim use another term if youre too scared to stand behind it
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,you know whos really pissed at this every single person who worked during the pandemic to keep things going
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,confiscating land over nitrogendozens of food processing attacks globally right tim nothing to see here
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,im beginning to resent the friendsfamily that voted for biden this was all avoidable and the people responsible will never get what they truly deserve  
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,also it was not the man made pandemic that caused these supply chain disruptions it was our reaction to the pandemic
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,for people in third world nations having children is their social security system
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,hindsight is 2020
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,tims trust in the system is gross at his age
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,sure tim its not orchestrated it just happens to follow the wef tenants exactly what are the odds
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,if the government used the same indicators as they used for jimmy carter the inflation rate today would be closer to 20
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,you lost me tim  theres zero chance this isnt intentional and evil
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,the fact that theyre admitting its 9 means its significantly worse than we realize
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,claiming this is all by accident dudes gaslighting his audience to keep his media company from being censored
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,i give praise to joe biden and the things that hes done well
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,remember that 012 that people saved on their bbq cookouts because of the residents policy last 4th of july and how they bragged about it
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,lets go brandon voters i hope you guys are very happy what joe biden did to this country
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,we can assume its around 15 because if they raised their wages by 21 you can be sure the raise wasnt just to beat inflation
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,its almost like paying farmers to destroy their crops for the past couple of years was a bad idea who woulda thunk it
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,aww now does tim understand why paying people more even to work doesnt fix anything
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,theyve been very upfront about all of this they dont believe poor people deserve to live same reason they want abortion
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,at least 40 of us currency has been printed over the last 12 months thats how worthless our dollar has become
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,tim we dont have enough and need a way to get more
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,if anyone thinks its only 91 youre being fooled
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,from what ive seen in my business inflation is far higher than 91 9 inflation is an understatement because if they told it was really 15 people would freak out
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,the inflation number is incorrect  they say its 91 but with everything being double and tripled in price its closer to 30 and above
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,tim i dont like conspiracy theories
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,91 is the cpi not inflation  inflation is truly probably over 20 cpi is the consumer price index a contrived often altered bs way of measuring price increases
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,feels way higher i feed a family of 5 and im spending 200and thats just getting the bare minimuma week sometimes more its completely insane best of luck everyone
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,people have been made and kept weak on purpose tim
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,problem is tim they created the flood by the way they intentionally dealt with the beer sickness
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,hmm last year i paid 100 for a gallon of 2 milk from walmart now around 400 thats a little more than 91
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,im so glad the adults are back in charge
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,when we get piled upon one another in large cities as in europe we shall become as corrupt as europe
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,whenever the government reports something will cost 1 you can be sure it will actually cost 3 when the government reports inflation is 1 you can be sure its 3
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,cops couldnt even fart without somebody smashing a window
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,the fact that they were arresting people running against them really shows you that revolting was justified
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,what we need is a weekly comprehensive inflation calculation using the same methods as in 1980 or so
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,tim keeps going they knew what they where doing the whole time they where just playing stupid but their too stupid to know what they where doing makes sense
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,why cant you just tell the truth tim every one knows this is intentional tucker has already figured it out
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,never let a crisis go to waste says it all
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,the trillion dollar infrastructure bill put us over the edge i cant help but believe this was on purpose
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,this really is the have we tried killing all the poor people to fix poverty joke
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,this is the result of more people telling others to do something than people actually doing something
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,even though inflation is making my med school debt much less painful i still say its an outright crime
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,global food shortage how can that be ive always seen that overpopulation is not a real thing
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,this is mostly the democrats fault except for the parts that arent   tim pool
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,food shortages and starvation meanwhile in europe lets get rid of farmers its for the environment
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,the real inflation is at 25 in ca gas prices increased from 3xx to 6xx  lunch from 6xx to 11xx   91 inflation number is a joke
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,if anyone wants to know how this ends read the book when money dies 
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,it will start with africa after they solve the problem the next area will be chosen gotta get rid of all these regulations and promote innovation
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,the funny thing is that its only medium horrible  10 was the catastrophe number
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,the largest farm land owner whos also involved in vaccines is concerned about population growth sounds like a good man
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,whats sad is just like with gas if this starts dropping theyll brag about seeing the greatest drop in percentage in years
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,why does everyone believe the numbers theyre given so blindly including tim
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,imagine actually believing that adding the demographic profile and growth trajectory of japan would somehow improve the lives of people in the drc
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,ive seen prices on some foods almost 50 rise there is no way its only 9
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,tim  the system became too heavy
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,that farmer should lower his prices for all of the people not doing anything joe biden
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,its funny how tim didnt take those last lines to its logical conclusion
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,tim some countries adopted green farming policies and theyre paying the price
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,tim covid19 was not a problem it would have been a minor hindrance if treated like an aggressive flu all of the problems arising from this are man made
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,yes tim it has to be anything but the people who say they are doing this to everyone makes total sence
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,i work for a food wholesaler every item we sell went up 10 last week beginning of july its not getting better anytime soon
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,proud to have been against the covid regime from day 1
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,when they said were going green they actually meant soylent green we should have read the fine print
Z7vPGLVBmLQ,you know tim the just move out of the cities advice rings as hollow as just get an electric car  very few people can afford to do that
A5VDHd4Imjk,dont you hate it when someone drops their logos and watermarks on videos they dont personally own
A5VDHd4Imjk,the earth is flat

Vh237C09VjI,jeremy was stealing scratch tickets when he was working at the truck  stop station and won 200k on a 5 dollar ticket
Vh237C09VjI,graham and spencer have to distance themselves from andrei and lefufu graham has staff to support too
Vh237C09VjI,had to listen to them for 30 minutes explaining why they were quitting
Vh237C09VjI,coffeezilla also just called out jeremy and andrei for voyager
Vh237C09VjI,discovered you after the meet kevin dui video and you are so entertaining
Vh237C09VjI,strongman keep going we love this
Vh237C09VjI,jeremys clearly not watching your videos until 5am otherwise he might actually say something valuable
Vh237C09VjI,please have your exwife on the channel worth a super chat for a good laugh
Vh237C09VjI,1 down 4 to go keep it up strongman
Vh237C09VjI,after several months of watching i finally subscribed
Vh237C09VjI,this mans laugh is sounding more and more like the skeleton from tales from the crypt
Vh237C09VjI,they need a vacation from getting their cheeks clapped at the truck stop
Vh237C09VjI,i dont think its bad you got divorced its bad you got remarried marriage is pointless these days
Vh237C09VjI,i started this trend of calling these guys out ignores coffeezilla and spencer cornelia making the same videos since 2018 ok weak man sure
Vh237C09VjI,jeremy also lived in expensive az vegas  no way he got rich on his own
Vh237C09VjI,strong man you should enroll in la foo foos free courses online and review them id imagine that you wouldnt want to give him any of your money
Vh237C09VjI,they end the show a week after the ftx money runs out lmao
Vh237C09VjI,you need to be careful strongman  i heard that jeremy is a fully trained sniper  or was that shyster  i cant remember
Vh237C09VjI,strange they quit right after the passive aggressive meet kevin money incident on jeremys channel
Vh237C09VjI,lefufu probably crying himself to sleep right now
Vh237C09VjI,delightful thanks for sharing your lunch

Vh237C09VjI,not even the ftx  sponsor was mentioned they must be scared as f
Vh237C09VjI,how is it fair your ex wife took half your money but she was working too sounds like marriage is even a bigger scam than crypto
Vh237C09VjI,lefufu is hittin them white lines lol
Vh237C09VjI,just a reminder that i made jeremy quit

IJ0EOZtFrYo,its very rare to see sonixexe games as good as this so this is definitely a pleasant surprise
IJ0EOZtFrYo,the developers of these horror games are really good and actually super creative and you dont normally get to see a sonicexe game like this so kudos to the developer
IJ0EOZtFrYo,i love seeing actually good 3d sonicexe games there arent too many of those around its honestly refreshing
IJ0EOZtFrYo,love the detail that the theme when sonicexe is close is just a slowed down version of the drowning theme from the classic sonic games
IJ0EOZtFrYo,fun fact sonic schoolhouse is a real game made all the way back in 1996 just without the horror stuff
IJ0EOZtFrYo,huh a sonicexe game thats presented in the style of a mixture of both sonics schoolhouse and baldis basics
IJ0EOZtFrYo,you know sonics school house was an actual educational sonic game from the early 90s
IJ0EOZtFrYo,its refreshing seeing good sonicexe game these days probably because people that got into sonicexe grew up and learn game development
IJ0EOZtFrYo,id definitely love to see more of this game
IJ0EOZtFrYo,fun fact the version of sonicexe used in this game is called xenophanes this version was created astramoniconx and is the current model for sonicexe
IJ0EOZtFrYo,so cool thank you so much for playing these games for us i know the majority of us wouldnt
IJ0EOZtFrYo,i like how all of the comments are chill and complementing the game
IJ0EOZtFrYo,fusion you need to play more sonicexe games especially the 3d and good ones
IJ0EOZtFrYo,woah fusion playing a sonicexe game that was unexpected
IJ0EOZtFrYo,alternative title fusion doesnt know how to get off the computers for 8 minutes straight
IJ0EOZtFrYo,pure nightmare fuel totally 100 definitely for sure terrifying so scary
IJ0EOZtFrYo,i dont really play horror games so im glad somone goes through the horror to entertain his fans
IJ0EOZtFrYo,waitsonic exe is still relevant i almost forgot about it still this game looks pretty good
IJ0EOZtFrYo,this game was really interesting watching this at 850pm
IJ0EOZtFrYo,that sonic education game is an actual sonic game that some of us wanna forget minuss the baldi aesthetic
IJ0EOZtFrYo,sonic walks like the kid who just came back from the principles office for throwing a peanut butter and jelly sandwich at the peanut allergy table
IJ0EOZtFrYo,i get this this is a reference to sonic schoolhouse a very pseudo scary sonic education game from the 90s made by sega
IJ0EOZtFrYo,i havent seen sonicexe get so much love in quite some time ever since the new fnf mod sonicexe has been getting way more attention which is great
IJ0EOZtFrYo,the game decided to emphasize the and then shock with a dramatic zoom
IJ0EOZtFrYo,im surprised fusion isnt falling asleep when he plays like he barely sleeps
IJ0EOZtFrYo,i honestly didnt expect you to play an exe game after so long
IJ0EOZtFrYo,thank you so much for posting so often your videos really entertain me and my brother and we always look forward to this time of the day
IJ0EOZtFrYo,it sounds like the music tells you when hes getting too close it gets louder and louder each time he gets super close to you
IJ0EOZtFrYo,the music when sonic spawns is so fucking creepy i cant his design is like no other you can tell they really put their foot into this one lol
IJ0EOZtFrYo,1148am perfect time to watch sonic with my mac n cheese like a bum les go
IJ0EOZtFrYo,i like how they used the new cannon form of sonicexe known as xenophanes thats cool and adds more of a scare kick to the game 
IJ0EOZtFrYo,wow this is different a sonicexe game that isnt just a retelling of the original creepypasta
IJ0EOZtFrYo,love how they used his xenophanes form in the first part of the game
IJ0EOZtFrYo,when your not even a minute into the game and you gotta slow down the video to see the model you know the games gonna be good
IJ0EOZtFrYo,its so nice to see that the creators used xenophanes kudos to them for that such a cool game
IJ0EOZtFrYo,oh man this looks epic sonicexe has come along way
IJ0EOZtFrYo,now that is a good looking exe game not nearly as bland and overdone as others ive seen
IJ0EOZtFrYo,just when i think this creepypasta is dead in the water fnf brings it back into the limelight
IJ0EOZtFrYo,from how he looks im pretty sure the sonicexe design in this is xenophanes sonic hes get the crystals on him and everything
IJ0EOZtFrYo,the door isnt meant to open at zero it gives you 4 seconds but its meant to be 5
IJ0EOZtFrYo,im watching this at 10 pm great video fusion
IJ0EOZtFrYo,yea 2 games in one day lets go
IJ0EOZtFrYo,fun fact the sonicexe in this game is actually xenophane sonic its the new canonical form of sonicexe
IJ0EOZtFrYo,i like the game play but i thought xenophane would be like 2x bigger than an average human
IJ0EOZtFrYo,i love how they used crystalxenophanes as the first antagonist but what in the hell is that story
IJ0EOZtFrYo,the main thing is that sonics schoolhouse is actualy a real game and not some parody on crapy indie horror that was created for streamers and youtubers
IJ0EOZtFrYo,im watching this at 645 pm and believe it or not its dark i love this game though
IJ0EOZtFrYo,current time 1041 pm i love this video
IJ0EOZtFrYo,fun fact sonic schoolhouse is actually a real game released in 1996
IJ0EOZtFrYo,fun fact the creator has had to watch fnf cause xenophen is rarely known from anywhere but fnfs sonicexe has the same looking xenophen sonicexe
IJ0EOZtFrYo,thanks for making content because lately my grandpa passed and your vids have been really cheering me up thanks for that
IJ0EOZtFrYo,honestly a huge missed opportunity not using teacher sonicexe for this
IJ0EOZtFrYo,fusion you are an awesome content creator love your content so much d
IJ0EOZtFrYo,i love how its like the sonic virus corrupted all the popular sonic and horror games
IJ0EOZtFrYo,having him stare at you through the window is chilling
IJ0EOZtFrYo,fun fact this version of sonicexe  is named xenophane sonic and he is a canon version
IJ0EOZtFrYo,seeing my favorite gamer play the demonized version of my favorite character is a perfect combo
IJ0EOZtFrYo,i love how xenophane sonic is straight up walking with a purpose lmfao
IJ0EOZtFrYo,i didnt expect a game to use xenophane sonicexe from the vs sonicexe mod on fnf as a 3d model
IJ0EOZtFrYo,the fandom refuses to forget sonic school house was a thing
IJ0EOZtFrYo,i love how they used the fnf model of sonicexe instead of making an original model
IJ0EOZtFrYo,finally a 3d sonicexe game love your work fusion wooot
IJ0EOZtFrYo,now were learning the physics of going fast
IJ0EOZtFrYo,im pretty sure that the school part is an actual sonic game without the baldi mechanism
IJ0EOZtFrYo,for people who dont know the sonicexe that appears here is xenophanes sonic or beast sonic from fnf vs sonicexe
IJ0EOZtFrYo,finally xenophanes sonicexe gets the love he deserves
IJ0EOZtFrYo,its not a mistake its a masterpiece
IJ0EOZtFrYo,i watched this at
IJ0EOZtFrYo,fusion youre making vids so fast i cant watch all of them from yesterday and today but ill get to them 
IJ0EOZtFrYo,the reason for sonics schoolhouse graphics and math and assets being similar to baldi is because sonics schoolhouse was the original inspiration for baldis basics
IJ0EOZtFrYo,i think this is my second sonicexe experience and it was so good
IJ0EOZtFrYo,im watching at
IJ0EOZtFrYo,much aside like the sonic exe games i wish debs would branch out to more games ie earthworm jim exe sparkster exe etc
IJ0EOZtFrYo,now who doesnt love new sonicexe games 
IJ0EOZtFrYo,if they added other horror games like batim that would be amazing
IJ0EOZtFrYo,oh my god sonic baldis basics and fnaf metal sonic editionfive nights at robotniks
IJ0EOZtFrYo,i love the way sonic exe walks in the first part of the game like wheres my beans

5NOZsuG3YVg,the fact that otis remembered the whole voicemail off by heart months after sending it tells me all i need to know
5NOZsuG3YVg,pls let these two at least have a whole episode being a couple and not being interrupted by any obstacles
5NOZsuG3YVg,the of course gets me every time maeve and otis forever and always
5NOZsuG3YVg,prediction  maeve and otis first date is otis teaching maeve how to ride a bike
5NOZsuG3YVg,absolutely loved their development people who got bored by them its just bc they arent built for slowburns they are soulmates
5NOZsuG3YVg,nothing feels right when youre not around thats right season 4 she better come back
5NOZsuG3YVg,lets be honest here maeve deserved it otis loved her enough to let her go  to achieve her dreams we were all happy with how season 3 ended
5NOZsuG3YVg,the story of maeve and otis is certainly one of the best romantic relationships ever in my opinion
5NOZsuG3YVg,its so funny when maeve shaked her head when otis asked how you said help in french cus emma maeve can actually speak french lol
5NOZsuG3YVg,you know otis is damn serious when he says of course to maeve
5NOZsuG3YVg,nothing can beat maeve and otis the chemistry is unreal i want them to be together as a couple in season 4 and save moordale
5NOZsuG3YVg,its always gonna be motis for me  cant wait for them to reunite and for maeve and jean to finally meet in season 4
5NOZsuG3YVg,please give us more screen time between these two as a couple in season 4 or we riot
5NOZsuG3YVg,season 4 character combos im most excited about
5NOZsuG3YVg,it only took three seasons but we finally managed to get a motis kiss
5NOZsuG3YVg,otis panicking in france is still my favorite thing
5NOZsuG3YVg,when two people can fill silence with poetry just by looking at each other they are special
5NOZsuG3YVg,on behalf of the motis fans who have been here since 2019 thank you cant wait to
5NOZsuG3YVg,you dont know how much weve waited for that kiss
5NOZsuG3YVg,maeve was happier this season but i hope we see maeve and otis happy together next season
5NOZsuG3YVg,what i want for season 4
5NOZsuG3YVg,i dont care what other people think about these 2 but i will always be an otis and maeve fan these 2 are an iconic pair
5NOZsuG3YVg,maeve  otisthe chemistry
5NOZsuG3YVg,honestly i cant believe people are even thinking of questioning this iconic pair its always been otis and maeve motis forever
5NOZsuG3YVg,emma already has the ability to bring emotion out of an audience which is the true sign of an artist
5NOZsuG3YVg,i dont worry about the future of these two as always otismaeve will overcome everything and finally be together of course
5NOZsuG3YVg,i love themi really like there kiss it was worth 2 season wait but wish they had more chemistry i am waiting for there relationship in season 4
5NOZsuG3YVg,badly waiting for season 4
5NOZsuG3YVg,i am totally hooked on this two there is no coming back now
5NOZsuG3YVg,love from india best web series i have ever seen yet waiting for its next season
5NOZsuG3YVg,i still cant get over this show
5NOZsuG3YVg,reading these comments makes me so happy because i thought people stopped caring about them theyre basically my fav ship and i believe theyre soulmates
5NOZsuG3YVg,the way otis just telling maeve the whole voicemail again because he found out maeve never got it just wonderful
5NOZsuG3YVg,if emma mackay isnt in season 4 im not watching it maeve and ottis are what this show is all about
5NOZsuG3YVg,when otis cries for help he says je suis  laise which is close to the actual words for help  laide but hes saying im comfortable instead haha
5NOZsuG3YVg,daily reminder that we got a freaking motis rain kiss im speechless
5NOZsuG3YVg,i am really so happy after looking at the comments cause i thought people did not think of otis and maeve as endgame anymoreyou all know why
5NOZsuG3YVg,i believe it will be wise for viewers to prepare for just as much problems for both of them in the next season hyped for the emotions rollercoster
5NOZsuG3YVg,their first kiss was perfect maeve  otis forever
5NOZsuG3YVg,this is perfect 3 seasons in the making and we finally have something between them
5NOZsuG3YVg,praying we get to finally see them be a couple in s4
5NOZsuG3YVg,whatever could be happened at season 4 deep inside my heart already written a word its always been you i love you maeve you are my person
5NOZsuG3YVg,i love them  this show is basically their love story
5NOZsuG3YVg,i dont know why people are shipping otis and ruby  i ship otis and maeve all day every day
5NOZsuG3YVg,i swear netflix needs to make more love scene of otis and maeve
5NOZsuG3YVg,okay im soooooooooooooo damn relieved by reading this comment section
5NOZsuG3YVg,i just love motis hugging each other its like them completing each other more powerful than them kissing
5NOZsuG3YVg,some people forget probably the most important message in the whole series
5NOZsuG3YVg,petition to netflix to make maeves new look after us trip as the one emma had during the british vogue interview
5NOZsuG3YVg,now these two are what you call endgame
5NOZsuG3YVg,i dont know how many of you noticed but at
5NOZsuG3YVg,their first kiss was everything
5NOZsuG3YVg,the fact that maeve doesnt know how to ride a bike must mean something for the next season right
5NOZsuG3YVg,i need friends like eric and aimee in my life they just need to be there
5NOZsuG3YVg,dont let this show stop like this thats my prayer now
5NOZsuG3YVg,luckily in this video there are mostly those who support motis
5NOZsuG3YVg,as a deckerstar and stydia shipper i love slowburn romance maeve and otis served that well
5NOZsuG3YVg,coz if i cant be with you romantically i still wanna see you everyday nothing feels right when youre not around
5NOZsuG3YVg,i love the scene when maeve laughed at otis because hes stressed
5NOZsuG3YVg,erics bye maeve at the end is so sweet
5NOZsuG3YVg,im so fn excited to see maeve and jeans first encounter
5NOZsuG3YVg,maeve and otis literally perfect for each other
5NOZsuG3YVg,maeve n otis deserve a good ending in s4
5NOZsuG3YVg,when maeve says back that it wasnt abt the money too she just wanted to be close to otisomg
5NOZsuG3YVg,we all are like eric at the end being sad and watching them from a far bye maeve

DM4Q-zimK8U,it appears jenny hasnt seen the show if she was surprised by how disgusting the disgusting option is
DM4Q-zimK8U,link  his unbeknownst cat food fetish is truly peculiar considering link detests a majority of foods it is always a surprise he never notices when he is eating cat food
DM4Q-zimK8U,i cant tell if i found this game too complicated or i was just overly influenced by link on this one
DM4Q-zimK8U,the absolute panic in her face when she realized cat food is an option it was amazing but i also felt that in my soul lol
DM4Q-zimK8U,when jenny asked what if i like things that are disgusting i so wanted them to introduce her to josh  hes been torturing them with disgusting food for years now
DM4Q-zimK8U,jenny slate is one of those great guests who probably has no knowledge of gmm but she fit right in and made for an awesome episode
DM4Q-zimK8U,ive only seen jenny in parks and rec but i love her outside of television shes so cute i loved when she immediately gets excited about taking the queen sweep
DM4Q-zimK8U,rhett and link should do a will it burn where they test their inner arson
DM4Q-zimK8U,link i dont say smella that i never say smella that
DM4Q-zimK8U,just watching jenny and her facial expressions was the best part of the episode
DM4Q-zimK8U,the horror she experienced when she realized what was at stake was similar to that of the contestants in squid game
DM4Q-zimK8U,jenny is a legend on parks and recreation as monalisa
DM4Q-zimK8U,jenny has always been awesome she had great energy with the guy  when she realized she had the queen sweep while link was vomiting on himself that was adorable lol

DM4Q-zimK8U,jenny is an absolutely gem and one of my favourite celebrities this episode was such a treat
DM4Q-zimK8U,rhett saying he could smell the fish sauce from his spot makes me think he chose the other option because he knew the one in front of link was bad
DM4Q-zimK8U,jenny slate
DM4Q-zimK8U,i love her its amazing how she can play such characters even though shes never experienced nuggets or a frosty
DM4Q-zimK8U,i love this game but this whole episode was wildly confusing
DM4Q-zimK8U,link yelling pointing and beating in that order are the only ways to show a flared temper i love it
DM4Q-zimK8U,after watching them talk about the game i genuinely became confused how to chose my answers lol
DM4Q-zimK8U,i like when guests come on the show who clearly have never watched the show
DM4Q-zimK8U,i love that you can see in jennys eyes the moment her soul left her body when she realized exactly what she had committed to
DM4Q-zimK8U,this game the shuffleboard the axe throwing and the extreme flavour guessing games will always be the most entertaining games to watch imo
DM4Q-zimK8U,sooooo glad you guys are bringing guests back its so entertaining how you guys interact with your guests
DM4Q-zimK8U,ive still never met a person who doesnt like eggnog outside the internet
DM4Q-zimK8U,love jenny i love her perspective i could just listen to her for hours
DM4Q-zimK8U,love her bubbly personality bring her back much more time in the future please
DM4Q-zimK8U,i love that gmm seems to be scoring a lot more amazing guests lately

DM4Q-zimK8U,jenny is so wholesome and adorable and witty i love her
DM4Q-zimK8U,i love jennys laugh its so honest and funny
DM4Q-zimK8U,after watching this i am certain that link is my spirit animal lol i also complicate uncomplicated things needlessly
DM4Q-zimK8U,jenny is so funny i loved her in the polka king such a funny movie great episode allthough i never really remember the actual format
DM4Q-zimK8U,ive been watching gmm for like 10 years it feels like i love that you guys havent missed a beat in content

DM4Q-zimK8U,jennys reaction to the queen sweep is so wholesome
DM4Q-zimK8U,link definitely smelled cat food and chose pda for the first one
DM4Q-zimK8U,jenny was so much fun love her
DM4Q-zimK8U,is this game as hard as link makes it seems had me crying
DM4Q-zimK8U,jenny must go into fullon meltdown mode in the summertime while shopping with all the flip flops around
DM4Q-zimK8U,jenny is such a sweet person i love her id give her big hugs im a hugger too
DM4Q-zimK8U,jenny is so good in parks  rec and bobs burgers glad too see her pop up

TLl6N2RdgPE,im a mediocre cross country runner and ive been cutting minutes off of my time and im starting to make a come up
KfPU21WUrPY,shes a good reporter no one is saying that shes great with questions and actually listens to them talk
KfPU21WUrPY,caroline is a fantastic interviewer we need more of her
KfPU21WUrPY,wanna take a moment and say rip to the legend william alvin moody cant mention the undertaker without the great paul bearer
KfPU21WUrPY,adesanya is the most king of the hill fighter they have to beat him he doesnt have to beat them
KfPU21WUrPY,that undertaker entrance was the reason wwe officials were present there
KfPU21WUrPY,i love that these full contact fighters can give respect to wrestling entertainment
KfPU21WUrPY,that was the most exciting thing about the fight
KfPU21WUrPY,izzy thinking of working for wwe in the future
KfPU21WUrPY,when the highlight of your fight is walking out to the undertaker theme lol
KfPU21WUrPY,highlight of the fight was the walkout   the rest was a snooze fest
KfPU21WUrPY,dominance for too long comes with complacency people get bored and the champion isnt as exciting when he just doesnt want to take risks
KfPU21WUrPY,loved he used the undertaker entrance it brought me back
KfPU21WUrPY,that undertaker wwe entrance was exactly like his performance dead
KfPU21WUrPY,got the  w without breaking his french tip nails
KfPU21WUrPY,he had a good game plan
KfPU21WUrPY,shes a great interviewer
KfPU21WUrPY,entrance was cool and the fact he mentioned stone cold and batista theme especially batista theme for me the ultimate wwe workout song
KfPU21WUrPY,bro when jared did his routine while being announced i totally thought izzy was gonna throw back some jitsu signs at him
KfPU21WUrPY,he doesnt even look like hes just fought like hes just got ready to go out for the night
KfPU21WUrPY,i liked the undertaker walkout was nice but hearing the awesome iconic madara speech was fire
KfPU21WUrPY,when izzy thought she was asking again about alex p then realizes she means alex v
KfPU21WUrPY,the last decisionbender
KfPU21WUrPY,the massive respect for max is good to see
KfPU21WUrPY,if munhoz had got that eye poke from izzy it would have been career ending  scissorhands
KfPU21WUrPY,what a smart fighter
KfPU21WUrPY,off night i thought he did technically great
KfPU21WUrPY,class entrance and cool touch for izzy to the undertaker
KfPU21WUrPY,that night the entrance was the highlight  awesome
KfPU21WUrPY,highlight of the fight was the walkout  the rest was a snooze fest
KfPU21WUrPY,i hope he makes the transition to wwe in the future
KfPU21WUrPY,i love how he says he had no idea that wwe was in town and coincidentally used undertaker theme why lie
KfPU21WUrPY,i like israel great talent having said that this dude looks way too much like et
KfPU21WUrPY,the undertaker of ufc
KfPU21WUrPY,okey next time i wanna hear cracking sound of glasses stone cold steve austin hell yeah
KfPU21WUrPY,i think israel is good but his fights have not been fun to watch for awhile before he was champ he was exciting
KfPU21WUrPY,israel is a very smart and humble fighter
KfPU21WUrPY,that walk out tho
KfPU21WUrPY,a super smart fighter
KfPU21WUrPY,look at him guys he could have been one of the greats but he fears losing so much
KfPU21WUrPY,at least we gonna get a exciting champ when izzy gets kod
KfPU21WUrPY,he punched his palm more than he has his opponents in the last 3 fights lol
KfPU21WUrPY,hes about to make his way to the wwe
KfPU21WUrPY,wwe  ufc coming together pretty cool tbh
KfPU21WUrPY,the greatest martial artist in mma
KfPU21WUrPY,kanes theme song would of been even more fire
KfPU21WUrPY,ufc needs more walk outs like that way better then  conners
KfPU21WUrPY,that madara speech
KfPU21WUrPY,i would like too see alex beats him and he willthat would be entertaining moment in the middleweight division
KfPU21WUrPY,he come out with the undertaker entrance because he knew he was gonna put the crowd to sleep
KfPU21WUrPY,the subtle shade i had an off night but he had the best night of of his career yet i won lol
KfPU21WUrPY,spirit also i think izzy looks nervous about fighting pereira but at least i hope that hell bend his style again
KfPU21WUrPY,long live undertaker
KfPU21WUrPY,i watch alex hit izzy with the left hook all night in both fights 2nd fight he got slept with it
KfPU21WUrPY,dana white dont watch ppvs illegally
KfPU21WUrPY,when i want to go sleep i will watch one of this mans recent fights
KfPU21WUrPY,people literally walked out when this fight was on
KfPU21WUrPY,in every fight he eye  poked his opponent and he says no one can  ko him hes lucky romero is not in ufc
KfPU21WUrPY,the greatest striker in ufc vs the greatest striker in wwe make the match also i like how they didnt even acknowledge aew was there lol
KfPU21WUrPY,this guy gotta be the most sensitive champion ever  dude blocks every single criticism from someone on social media
KfPU21WUrPY,greatest entrance to a ufc fight ever
KfPU21WUrPY,lol hes calling the greats to give power to his argument that his fights are boring
KfPU21WUrPY,yesss him vs alex will be the best fight
KfPU21WUrPY,superb interviewer
KfPU21WUrPY,hes champion hes winning hes undefeated at middleweight and despite all of that his stock as a ppv attraction is declining impressive
KfPU21WUrPY,if he becomes a wrestler it will be legendary
KfPU21WUrPY,such a poor performance from the champ shook from pereiras victory
KfPU21WUrPY,is it true the fight was bad because ive seen comments about it being bad he should have a full wwe career actually
KfPU21WUrPY,the urn had more life inside it than the octagon during his fight
KfPU21WUrPY,izzy is such a smooth talker
KfPU21WUrPY,izzy the ufc
KfPU21WUrPY,loved the enterance
KfPU21WUrPY,israel  the decision taker adesanya
KfPU21WUrPY,hes setting up his transition to wwe for when he loses to alex later
KfPU21WUrPY,stone cold entrance next would be sickkkk but would be risky because he could be going out cold
KfPU21WUrPY,people were literally walking out of his fight dude like come on
7xouEd5cVE8,linus said that he chickened out of trying to hide it so they could test it
7xouEd5cVE8,i hope i never have to carry this phone as described thanks for the lolz linus
7xouEd5cVE8,airplane mode of course thatll work but have you thought about turning it off prior to insertion by any chance
7xouEd5cVE8,thats not a phone thats a multitool especially with the vibrations
7xouEd5cVE8,a security guard of the local prison once showed me how they charge phones in prison
7xouEd5cVE8,when linus talked all about building a lab to give true tech reviews and testing this wasnt the type of device i envisioned
7xouEd5cVE8,my disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined because of linus chickening out
7xouEd5cVE8,the fact that linus had to explain how the button navigation worked and i was just like oooh neat
7xouEd5cVE8,more prison tech but heres the catch linus needs to be in a makeshift cell with only stuff a prisoner would have to review the item no screwdriver etc
7xouEd5cVE8,the voice changing features are useful but rather suspicious
7xouEd5cVE8,zancos are popular in uk prisons
7xouEd5cVE8,finally a modern phone that makes even linuss hands look big
7xouEd5cVE8,zanco actually makes a smaller version of that phone which i have but when you get these phones they are already banned from many mobile networks in the uk
7xouEd5cVE8,this one is a new favorite i wouldnt mind seeing more tech with hidden purposes
7xouEd5cVE8,i dont think linus has had this much fun with a piece of tech in a long time
7xouEd5cVE8,i used to work in a prison
7xouEd5cVE8,reminds me of the presmartphone precolor mobile phone age in the late 90s and early 2000s when the jokes were about the trend for phones getting ridiculously smaller
7xouEd5cVE8,glad to see taran hasnt changed a bit since the last time i saw him on camera keep up the good work buddy
7xouEd5cVE8,ive never seen linus laugh so genuine as when he first heard the gun shot ringtone
7xouEd5cVE8,this is one of the most enjoyable videos ive seen in a while informative and downright stupid i love it
7xouEd5cVE8,i remember that about a year ago my classmate had a phone smaller than a pack of tictacs i was so mindblown to see that phones can be that small
7xouEd5cVE8,i can almost imagine linus in the meeting when this topic was brought up you can hear the excitement in his voice
7xouEd5cVE8,it could be a pretty interesting video going over a tech care package you could send someone during that 30 day window
7xouEd5cVE8,imagine all the criminals of all different types tying to figure out how this janky phone works lol
7xouEd5cVE8,i actually want one of these  it would be so much easier to keep my phone on the keychain attached to my wallet than in my pocket xd
7xouEd5cVE8,honestly this is one of the best videos in a little while its great to see the interesting however gross ways people are using technology
7xouEd5cVE8,i laughed the entire video thanks
7xouEd5cVE8,no buttdial jokes i am frankly shocked
7xouEd5cVE8,i never imagine linus talking about safety and best practices in this channel
7xouEd5cVE8,look daddy linus is reviewing a tiny phone can we watch it are they really going to put it in a cantaloupe i wanna see
7xouEd5cVE8,nice to see hetzner as a sponsor been using them for a decade theyre excellent
7xouEd5cVE8,the feeling when linus wont take one for the teamfor science
7xouEd5cVE8,linus in prison the new rtx
7xouEd5cVE8,this was the most fun video to watch in a while you guys are maaaasters of entertainment without having to slap anyone
7xouEd5cVE8,it could be a pretty interesting video going over a tech care package you could send someone during that 30 day window in canada
7xouEd5cVE8,quality content linus really enjoyed this one
7xouEd5cVE8,all jokes aside that thing looks like a marvel of engineering holy hell
7xouEd5cVE8,this is easily the most fun bit of technology ive ever seen in my life minus where you put it of course
7xouEd5cVE8,careful not to get stuf in the charging port after insertion it voids the warranty
7xouEd5cVE8,never thought id see linus wrap something in a condom before inserting it into a hole that it looks like it most certainly will not fit in
7xouEd5cVE8,why would anybody pay for this thing at all
7xouEd5cVE8,i think theyre on to something here  maybe its time someone comes out with a whole line of products designed to be stuck up ones behind and beat the boss
7xouEd5cVE8,ive seen a number of different models like this unsurprisingly sold in phone shops near prisons
7xouEd5cVE8,fun fact this phone was designed for space travel specifically to travel to uranus but linus read the instructions wrong
7xouEd5cVE8,i heavily support this communication in prisons is an absolute fucking nightmare and everyone involved in that shitshow should be in prison themselves
7xouEd5cVE8,this whole episode was pretty hilarious great
7xouEd5cVE8,great vid but i was really hoping for just the reaction shot of linuss face while he was bent over a table on set conducting a feasibility study
7xouEd5cVE8,absolutely one of the best videos ever released from linus tech tips
7xouEd5cVE8,a room full of tech nerds seems to have forgotten that you can simply turn a phone off to keep it from sendingreceiving something
7xouEd5cVE8,i mean i would like that phone in my bugout bag  small lightweight and probably runs 1000 times longer on a charge than my smart phone
7xouEd5cVE8,this phone reminds me of the trend in the early 2000s when phone manufacturers were having what was essentially an arms race to make the tiniest phone possible
7xouEd5cVE8,linus shouldve offered a raise to whoever took the phone in for
7xouEd5cVE8,im sure it has a good personality
7xouEd5cVE8,ive wondered for years why noone was making the smallest phone they could rather than every company following the same trend
7xouEd5cVE8,ha ha ha ex inmate here never used my prison pocket this is probably the funnest video ive seen from you guys thanks
7xouEd5cVE8,at this point i dont know if linus purposefully drops items or if it really embedded into his motor skills
7xouEd5cVE8,honestly for the price point its pretty amazing
7xouEd5cVE8,three days standby time thats good in case you need to keep it in hiding you cant just charge it
7xouEd5cVE8,i would totally watch more prison tech videos
7xouEd5cVE8,imo you should use gnd from the phone common with faradays cage to get a lower signal level
7xouEd5cVE8,i like how when theyre testing for radiation the modern phone is literally right next to it for the sake of distraction
7xouEd5cVE8,interestingly enough these have actually been around for a pretty long time when i was stationed in korea i knew someone with one of these
7xouEd5cVE8,this phone didnt just pass linuss expectations it completely rectum
7xouEd5cVE8,one of the highest entertainment value videos you guys have done in a long time reminiscent of the older janky videos of yesteryears
7xouEd5cVE8,this is beyond hilarious whoever came up with this video idea deserves a raise lol
7xouEd5cVE8,nice to know that if you are out and about without any pockets you have someplace to store the phone
7xouEd5cVE8,the only downside im seeing here is it uses 2g which is mostly gone in alot of places
7xouEd5cVE8,weve reached a new level of linus teaching us how to do something that we will never get the chance to do
7xouEd5cVE8,this phone is similar like one seen by amy wong in futurama now as real as it might seen
7xouEd5cVE8,it depends on what prison you are at i have a smartphone and im in prison yes ive seen those on herethey sell for 500 each
7xouEd5cVE8,this would have been the perfect moment for linus to launch his of
7xouEd5cVE8,that was very helpful im going to prison next month for embezzlement
7xouEd5cVE8,dont you
7xouEd5cVE8,this is weird i never thought id see linus talk about something iv actually used for a couple years
7xouEd5cVE8,hear me out  i think the benefit of a slightly larger version would outweigh the costs

ekvJA3GZw1Y, 
-y1eZlRQL7w,i wish theyd include one of those legendary quad dacs that lg has on this beauty that would be an audiophiles dream of a feature phone
-y1eZlRQL7w,the buds in the phone charger is clever so top notch for that
-y1eZlRQL7w,i appreciate the nostalgic appeal but adding a modern look and feel to it would have been better maybe adding support for music streaming services with good audio codecs
-y1eZlRQL7w,love the quirky design of the xpressaudio if only hmd could replicate these bold designs to their lackluster nokia smartphones
-y1eZlRQL7w,reminds me of the old charm nokia used to have with the most boldest and successful phones of all times
-y1eZlRQL7w,if they could connect with other devices as well then its make the perfect backupsecondary phone
-y1eZlRQL7w,i wish someone would make a feature phone with a decent camera on board
-y1eZlRQL7w,its great that we can have really compact phones packed with some decent features
-y1eZlRQL7w,if it had usbc and spotify i would buy it so fast
-y1eZlRQL7w,there should be more smartphones with built earbuds in them why carry a charging case when the phone itself can charge the earbuds just common sense
-y1eZlRQL7w,bet itll be a great sidekick phone was proud to have one of this bad boy back in the day
-y1eZlRQL7w,oh wow must buy just for the hell of it i wonder if i can preorder this today look forward to your review as always
-y1eZlRQL7w,im still using my beat up nokia 216 feature phone since 2017 and despite having numerous drops and a lot of scratches it still works as good as new
-y1eZlRQL7w,i have a sony mp3 nwa25 you know decent mp3 player physical buttons great sound
-y1eZlRQL7w,such a shame they lost the xpressmusic tm
-y1eZlRQL7w,i had the same reaction to the microusb lmao
-y1eZlRQL7w,curious to see how the fm radio works
-y1eZlRQL7w,i like it but i may prefer the 2660 flip instead
-y1eZlRQL7w,lindo modelo
-y1eZlRQL7w,the microusb is an obvious dealbreaker what the hell were they thinking its 2022
-y1eZlRQL7w,what great days full of real creativity now putting some led on back panel of noting is the end of creativity we could have
-y1eZlRQL7w,honestly i would use it as a walkman it is more a device to listen to your favorite songs for a while than for daytoday use
-y1eZlRQL7w,i expected earbuds to come with smart phone not feature phone
-y1eZlRQL7w,nice thats a cool idea  now i wait to hear that this phones keyboard can slide down and make the phone a hole big touch screen
-y1eZlRQL7w,finally someone come up with at least some innovation
-y1eZlRQL7w,wow thats one hell of a innovation
-y1eZlRQL7w,more retro phones please this is great idea  bring back the razor but with modern tech of course
-y1eZlRQL7w,micro usb in 2022 is simply unacceptable
-y1eZlRQL7w,this is good for running man im totally gonna buy this soon
-y1eZlRQL7w,i love this phone amazing video
-y1eZlRQL7w,good old days will be back with some touch of futurism now its time for sony to bring the walkmen also
-y1eZlRQL7w,man you are the best youtube reviewer  what sense of humour
-y1eZlRQL7w,wow 5710 looks great
-y1eZlRQL7w,wow this is a great phone if you just need one with basic features lets say you are hiking or camping or travelling
-y1eZlRQL7w,used to have a nokia express back in 0709 was a dope phone
-y1eZlRQL7w,5710 seems a good detox phone and a funky one  at it too
-y1eZlRQL7w,its really only missing spotify
-y1eZlRQL7w,just need a 613050 reboot with all the indestructibility they came with
-y1eZlRQL7w,i am glad that they are remaking the old cool phones i might buy one for the laugh
-y1eZlRQL7w,your reactions was so hilarious when you found out it uses micro usbhahaha
-y1eZlRQL7w,wait whats app still supports series 30 phones i thought they killed that long ago
-y1eZlRQL7w,i wouldve paid higher if it had 64 gb storage and higher ram
-y1eZlRQL7w,missing xpress music version  specially 5130
-y1eZlRQL7w,finally a cool phone
-y1eZlRQL7w,imagine this phone in 2006
-y1eZlRQL7w,this looks awesome  i have to get one cheers
-y1eZlRQL7w,if spotify can make its way to this phone i can see carry this as an mp3 player if not its kinda a waste
-y1eZlRQL7w,the good ol days when daddy spurt is doing reviews while standing
-y1eZlRQL7w,if spotify worked on this thing id snap one up im sick of big phones
-y1eZlRQL7w,at least give us kai os
-y1eZlRQL7w,i would go for it if it were 99
-y1eZlRQL7w,paying for the brand  nostalgic factor
-y1eZlRQL7w,if it has spotify im getting one
-y1eZlRQL7w,spotify or amazon music apps on this would make me happy
-y1eZlRQL7w,damn first i was like oh thats neat but then i heard micro usb
-y1eZlRQL7w,32gb is way to small at least 128 for a portable music player d
-y1eZlRQL7w,with a battery capacity that small and the lack of music streaming  apps ill pass
-y1eZlRQL7w,like to see usbc no earbud model use it as mp3 with my own headphones
-y1eZlRQL7w,15 years ago i would be all over it
-y1eZlRQL7w,it would have been awesome if i could run soundcloud spotify or apple music but it cant so its kinda pointless
-y1eZlRQL7w,what about 35 audio jack  its avaiable or not 
-y1eZlRQL7w,one major issue 4g make the phone very sluggish overall the are doing great except software need serious refining
-y1eZlRQL7w,good ol xpressmusic phones when i used to own them such a nice phone
-y1eZlRQL7w,nokia is insane
-y1eZlRQL7w,micro usb had me interested up until that point
-y1eZlRQL7w,i want one
-y1eZlRQL7w,my galaxy smartwatch is at least10 times better than this thing in almost every way but you cant put a price on nostalgia
-y1eZlRQL7w,everything is fabulous in this phone but it lacks 5g connectivity
-y1eZlRQL7w,how i wish its compatible with spotify
-y1eZlRQL7w,in 2000 i wouldve killed for one of these
-y1eZlRQL7w,why have they not made one of these feature phones with whats app with a qwerty keyboard  id buy that thing a a back up phone all day long
-y1eZlRQL7w,the expression with the micro usb lol
-y1eZlRQL7w,our king is back
-y1eZlRQL7w,nokia 5710 will have stereo fm and stereo speakers
-y1eZlRQL7w,hello how do you get your home screen so cool on your redmi phones
-y1eZlRQL7w,nokia phone my first love
-y1eZlRQL7w,make phones and nokia great again
-y1eZlRQL7w,they shouldve called it xpressmusic
-y1eZlRQL7w,xpress audio someone messed up the naming there

ScX5BTsqZnY,kourtneys gluten free dairy free sugar free lifestyle is too much does she want salads for 8 year olds birthday
ScX5BTsqZnY,no wonder kendall doesnt know how to cut a cucumber she wasnt part of this cooking lesson
ScX5BTsqZnY,kaitlyn implying that women should be in the kitchen and he should be in the gold course is ironic af
ScX5BTsqZnY,why does your car have leather seats  why you wearing plastic glasses   kourtney  is so extra
ScX5BTsqZnY,i love it when kim calls kourtney out on her bs
ScX5BTsqZnY,kendall facial expressions when her and khloe at the dinner table with kris

fgy4WZ9ta7E,this actually had my attention until i looked more into it mostly ship battles no on foot exploring of land or melee combat
fgy4WZ9ta7E,this game has been in development for 9 years and this still looks like a bare bones tech demo what the hell was ubisoft doing all this time
fgy4WZ9ta7E,we need foot combat and base management taking over whole port towns would be awesome
fgy4WZ9ta7E,this would be nice as a single player game going to pass on multiplayer only
fgy4WZ9ta7E,i wasnt expecting much but man ubisoft still managed to disappoint
fgy4WZ9ta7E,this looks like a huge opportunity lost with more disappointments than enjoyments definitely a game with massive potential now inspiring other developers to do better
fgy4WZ9ta7E,this is ridiculous
fgy4WZ9ta7E,i knew you were going to botch this but youve exceeded my expectations even i couldnt predict how much youd fail this
fgy4WZ9ta7E,ive been waiting for this game for soooooo long looks like everything i wanted
fgy4WZ9ta7E,the compelling gameplay
fgy4WZ9ta7E,im actually excited for this sure it could use some more realism and gloom and some personal combat if you focus on those im sure it will be great
fgy4WZ9ta7E,so much potential could have had open world treasure hunting amazing naval warfare for honoresque sword combat and simple flintlock weapons
fgy4WZ9ta7E,i had high hopes for a proper pirate game black flags gameplay  sid meiers pirates managementsimulator system this looks like ubisofts anthem
fgy4WZ9ta7E,lets make a aaa pirate game in 2022 without any land exploration or sword fights
fgy4WZ9ta7E,the first thing i think of when i think of pirates is how they used to mine from their ships along the shore
fgy4WZ9ta7E,ubi never failed to amaze me with how they keep on improving the cinematic graphics year by year and yet worsen the actual gameplay outcome
fgy4WZ9ta7E,waited so many years for this game cant wait for it
fgy4WZ9ta7E,the public we want this and this
fgy4WZ9ta7E,imagine looking at this and thinking of how great this game will be
fgy4WZ9ta7E,my feedback after the reveal yesterday
fgy4WZ9ta7E,looking forward to realize my life long fantasy of being a pirate ship
fgy4WZ9ta7E,all we wanted was assassins creed 4 without the assassins how hard was that to understand ubisoft we wanted to be pirates not oversized boats
fgy4WZ9ta7E,do not despair one day we will have the gritty realistic pirate game we all want where ships dont move like jetskis
fgy4WZ9ta7E,one of the fantastic examples of the reason there isnt a dislike tracker on youtube anymore
fgy4WZ9ta7E,imagine if r released a gta game where you can only play as a car    why is there no sword fighting or proper boarding
fgy4WZ9ta7E,every aspect mentioned here was in sid meiers pirates over 20 years ago that being said i loved that game
fgy4WZ9ta7E,the good side a pirate premise with interesting mechanics and combat
fgy4WZ9ta7E,im still looking for a game that uses actual wind in the sails like sea of thieves did so well
fgy4WZ9ta7E,any on foot gameplay like fights and treasure maps this game looks like my dream pirate game and with on foot combat and everything it would be complete
fgy4WZ9ta7E,as usual the graphics and beauty of the outside world at the height but there is one problem wooden characters their without emotional stone
fgy4WZ9ta7E,almost preorderd the game watched this trailer just in time
fgy4WZ9ta7E,on a scale from 110 on how out of touch are you with your fanbase
fgy4WZ9ta7E,imagine a vast elden ring style open world thats an ocean full of uncharted islands
fgy4WZ9ta7E,ah yes games as a service i expect this to be a strong 310 on release
fgy4WZ9ta7E,this game was initially supposed to be released in 2018 its been 4 additional years it better be the best game weve ever played
fgy4WZ9ta7E,damn its like more realistic sea of thieves i love it
fgy4WZ9ta7E,dam why cant we just get a open world good pirate game for once
fgy4WZ9ta7E,expectations seem very high for this  maybe it can turn out good find out when it releases
fgy4WZ9ta7E,ngl im excited for this game i like the naval combat and i think it would be fun  sad that there isnt on foot combat though
fgy4WZ9ta7E,why does this have to be made by ubisoft it looks so cool
fgy4WZ9ta7E,looks goodbut too seriousive loved sea of thieves for years now because its sooo much fun to play
fgy4WZ9ta7E,im skeptical but still relatively hopeful to have a game that represents the pirate trope since they are so rare
fgy4WZ9ta7E,this would have been interesting if it were single player instead of pvp
fgy4WZ9ta7E,ubisofts creativity sank harder than any ship in this game over the past 5 years
fgy4WZ9ta7E,cant wait to roleplay as a spikey boat which is as we all know the ultimate fantasy of highseas adventure
fgy4WZ9ta7E,please bring the boarding mechanics back it was a massive fun for a pirate game in ac4
fgy4WZ9ta7E,so far this sounds like everything i wanted sea of thieves to be so im very excited
fgy4WZ9ta7E,the most amount of entertainment ill get from this game is watching the metacritic score during and after launch ill stick to black flag personally
fgy4WZ9ta7E,im honestly excited pirates are known to fight on the seas after all just wish boarding actually had a gameplay mechanic
fgy4WZ9ta7E,if i get this game im just going to be wishing that there was on foot combat the whole time
fgy4WZ9ta7E,i assume we can customize our personal pirate character dont want the dark chocolate look hehe
fgy4WZ9ta7E,at this point im surprised anyone still has hopes for a game made by ubisoft
fgy4WZ9ta7E,god i would love the see a story pirate game like rdr2 campaign level pirate game would be insane
fgy4WZ9ta7E,its like sea of thrives but u cant get boarded i dig it
fgy4WZ9ta7E,i just feel bad for the devs that have spent almost a decade of their lives working on a game that is basically doomed to fail
fgy4WZ9ta7E,i think this actually looks great

NI_kLmnxG-k,glad to know she was arrested what a nasty lunatic
NI_kLmnxG-k,the brazen attitude of people today sometimes you just cant just hold back
NI_kLmnxG-k,i wonder why did people just stand around and not try to stop her she had no business hitting that woman  she needs to go to jail
NI_kLmnxG-k,that shyt gets my blood boiling punks like her know damn well who they do it too
NI_kLmnxG-k,california vs ny in these food fights  the only difference california still came back  set up shop california built differently
NI_kLmnxG-k,a great role model proud mother of the and black women of the year
NI_kLmnxG-k,thats some serious rage
NI_kLmnxG-k,in cali criminals have more rights  i guarantee you if the workers would have beat her down they would have more severe charges than what shell face
NI_kLmnxG-k,she owes them money for all that food they lost  i hope nothing more happens to that family
NI_kLmnxG-k,they deserve it for being in la
NI_kLmnxG-k,thats one scary grizzly bear
NI_kLmnxG-k,not sayin she wasnt wrong but we need the full story
NI_kLmnxG-k,madre defend yourself and why was no one protecting her just filming instead of intervening assault battery theft hate crime this should not be happening or should it be ok
NI_kLmnxG-k,point out that shes black and shes the oppressor not the victim
NI_kLmnxG-k,she was not under the influence
NI_kLmnxG-k,my blood is boiling after watching this smfh
NI_kLmnxG-k,its time raza needs to come together enough is enough already
NI_kLmnxG-k,anger management or freakin medication zero tolerance for this abhorrent behavior
NI_kLmnxG-k,another hate crime by a violent person she shouldve opened her own legal businesses and wouldve been hired if she was an unaggressive hardworker
NI_kLmnxG-k,geez i wonder why every race is wary of one and no one wants to call out their supremacy despite leading in hate crimes
NI_kLmnxG-k,everything she threw she bought oh you go pay for that ish maam crazy a
NI_kLmnxG-k,this should read a black woman angry
NI_kLmnxG-k,shes going to jail good
NI_kLmnxG-k,thats what happens when you dont expect ebt
NI_kLmnxG-k,crazy woman should kept in jail for a long time
NI_kLmnxG-k,if you ever had a job in retail youve felt the rage of an angry middle aged black woman
NI_kLmnxG-k,how delicious that burrito is it seems that the burrito is so tasty making her crazy
NI_kLmnxG-k,she ate everything and wanted more but she dont wanna pay for it thats typical american consumer behavior
NI_kLmnxG-k, they  are their worst enemies 
NI_kLmnxG-k,welp shes going to jail
NI_kLmnxG-k,you think shes throwing a tantrum but its just casual communicating in her culture
NI_kLmnxG-k,what a damn disgrace this woman is  i do hope everyone is ok  this is all too common and it is not right
NI_kLmnxG-k,she was angry that she didnt get a free burrito  thats all
NI_kLmnxG-k,the woman who got attacked  lol her name is exactly what shes going to do that lady
NI_kLmnxG-k,take the bully out quickly one day it will be the wrong woman she messes with she is very very lucky it wasnt me  dont let age full you
NI_kLmnxG-k,those of you who are in the foodservice industry you have a right to implement the rayon mcintosh initiative
NI_kLmnxG-k,i could not at all stand being in the group i mean for real this is embarrassing but its typical
NI_kLmnxG-k,does anybody know the address i would like to buy some
NI_kLmnxG-k,well it could have been worse  imagine if they were selling spicy chicken sandwiches
NI_kLmnxG-k,she was mad the burrito didnt taste like fried chicken
NI_kLmnxG-k,please report every aggressive customer no matter who they are not acceptable love and peace equal rights for everybody
NI_kLmnxG-k,why do people just record shit and not help
NI_kLmnxG-k,reporting on stuff that matters
NI_kLmnxG-k,burritos are one hell of a drugg
NI_kLmnxG-k,wish i was there i dont tolerate this shit no more check ur people before is too late and hell breaks loose
NI_kLmnxG-k,its a hate crimethese battlebots never stopespecially when they have to pay for anything someone else made
NI_kLmnxG-k,she will be served good the way she like it in jail hope she uses that energy in jail too
NI_kLmnxG-k,she in jail with no burrito eatin jail food now lol
NI_kLmnxG-k,then you wonder why her kids grown to be nobetter
NI_kLmnxG-k,the vendor should use tiktok as a online cctv giving safe place to sale food and help can dispatch police early if bad thing  do happen
NI_kLmnxG-k,they are in crisis and sinking into the abyss
NI_kLmnxG-k,schizophrenia in america peeps
NI_kLmnxG-k,look  the attacker whaddya expect
NI_kLmnxG-k,if she comes backyall better have a bat ready for that woman
NI_kLmnxG-k,if she couldnt get that burrito her body fats would decrease

NI_kLmnxG-k,grown woman behaving badly
NI_kLmnxG-k,thats assault and a cry for help
NI_kLmnxG-k,they would have been in their rights to arrest her and hold her for the police  this is silliness messing up someones business like that is wrong
NI_kLmnxG-k,this is great
NI_kLmnxG-k,there kind has no respect
NI_kLmnxG-k,i will get a permit and buy a gun this criminals are getting out of control
NI_kLmnxG-k,the new black supremacists
NI_kLmnxG-k,so predictable that it was an angry black woman
NI_kLmnxG-k,seriously couldnt that black lady leave that poor women alone
NI_kLmnxG-k,is the black community okay
NI_kLmnxG-k,muchas especies o alimentos vegetacion cultura  y animales fueron son y sern extremadamente necesarios y productivos en el intercambio entre continentes  algunas han sido la peor desgracia para la humanidad
NI_kLmnxG-k,diversity is our strength
NI_kLmnxG-k,but but but i thought only white people do stuff like this
NI_kLmnxG-k,this is why you should carry a gun
NI_kLmnxG-k,same race all the time smh

eJg-5i9x66Q,shes a grown ass woman and she asks a kid to set her up with his coworker
eJg-5i9x66Q,i really liked how noah handled the situation he straight up told her to slide into his dm haha its funny celebrities fighting like normal people
eJg-5i9x66Q,honestly all of this couldve been avoided and handled much maturely but given how this society works now
eJg-5i9x66Q,its so fcking weird to have someone thirst over you publicly dojas a creep
eJg-5i9x66Q,i honestly feel bad for joseph bc he was brought into all of this shit tbh
eJg-5i9x66Q,if she wanted a shot at him publicly shaming a 17yearold for acting like a 17yearold probably wasnt the way to do it
eJg-5i9x66Q,aside from using a teenager to get to his coworker
eJg-5i9x66Q,shes mad that a teenager acted like a teenager
eJg-5i9x66Q,protect joseph quinn from people like these at all costs
eJg-5i9x66Q,considering i love her music  its frustrating to see doja cats such a clout chaser shes always trolling and now causing drama smh
eJg-5i9x66Q,yeahi dont think joseph is interested
eJg-5i9x66Q,why couldnt she have searched for josephs instagram its weird that she even messages noah about it when noah doesnt even have scenes with joseph in stranger things
eJg-5i9x66Q,ok shes an adult has 17 girl go get this man yourself without needing the help of a 17 year old i feel bad for joseph quinn
eJg-5i9x66Q,doja better not start no drama with joe
eJg-5i9x66Q,ok does she really  find him attractive or does she find  the character he played on stranger things attractive
eJg-5i9x66Q,i feel like the way doja is handling the situation is not right u dont randomly slide into someones dms trying to date
eJg-5i9x66Q,outcome both should take accountability and apologize
eJg-5i9x66Q,she shot and missed also noah is a kid why she contacting him
eJg-5i9x66Q,i wouldve never even known about this if doja didnt put him on blast its lowkey embarrassing for her
eJg-5i9x66Q,sometimes doja needs to learn how to handle things in private and not say it all in on the internet
eJg-5i9x66Q,doja i understand cuz
eJg-5i9x66Q,no she tried to get a seventeen year old to do it for her
eJg-5i9x66Q,if i was joseph i would respond to her but only to say that i dont date immature grown women who attack teens online for being teens
eJg-5i9x66Q,i loved him in stranger things
eJg-5i9x66Q,to begin with noah should not have shared their private dm or at least he should have asked for her permission
eJg-5i9x66Q,she just likes him for the character not for himself in real life
eJg-5i9x66Q,i dont blame doja for not wanting all her personal information out all the time
eJg-5i9x66Q,doja bestie we get it but like get it together
eJg-5i9x66Q,no mention of the fact she asked a child to hook her up with his costar   if this aint part of the problem i dont know what is
eJg-5i9x66Q,jq gives heath ledger vibes
eJg-5i9x66Q,if she thinks she still has a chance w joseph after abusing noah shed be dead wrong
eJg-5i9x66Q,maybe on this occasion running for your life might be the wisest move joseph
eJg-5i9x66Q,wow how embarrassing for her like girl you could have went with the joke and you decided to make it drama
eJg-5i9x66Q,shes acting like me back when i was in 7th grade trying to get a girls attention although not as extreme i look back at my behavior with sincere cringe
eJg-5i9x66Q,i love doja but this is not her best moment its not hard to find joes socials and there was no need to ask noah
eJg-5i9x66Q,lets ask joseph  eddie his opinion on this
eJg-5i9x66Q,how does joseph react to this i wanna see it
eJg-5i9x66Q,i love the editing shows the scene with eddiethen says spoiler alert like i can see clearly what happened
eJg-5i9x66Q,poor noah  an adult dming a 17 yr old boy calling him a snake
eJg-5i9x66Q,joseph could do way better than her fr
eJg-5i9x66Q,im dyingeveryone wants joeseph
eJg-5i9x66Q,doja is not joes type she seems creepy by asking a 1718 yr old to set her up with his coworker
eJg-5i9x66Q,im no matchmaker but i dont think shes his type  they have totally different energies that would clash
eJg-5i9x66Q,joe needs to run away from this one publicly bullies a 17yo because she did something inappropriate if shes already publicly admitted she likes him why not just own it
eJg-5i9x66Q,first joseph doesnt like women who swear and who are aggressive second joseph has a girlfriend
eJg-5i9x66Q,my question is why noah like why not jamie whos close to him like another adult instead of a kid
eJg-5i9x66Q,if theres no more tea then that means they are chatting in secret
eJg-5i9x66Q,this whole situation is like something straight out of high school
eJg-5i9x66Q,paraben linda festa
eJg-5i9x66Q,make eddie munson alive in season 5
eJg-5i9x66Q,doja cat is me  she has great taste
eJg-5i9x66Q,doja should leave him alone shes already causing issues and they havent even spoke lol
eJg-5i9x66Q,i hope joseph quinn doesnt give doja the time of day after the stuff she says about noah shes childish
eJg-5i9x66Q,i woke up to see one sided drama
eJg-5i9x66Q,i dont think doja and him would be good together in the first place
eJg-5i9x66Q,if im being completely honest i think joseph would think doja is just weird asf
eJg-5i9x66Q,lol entertainment news died when their sources became social media posts or dms i still cant get used to anchors narrating the texts
eJg-5i9x66Q,doja snaps back at noah for sharing the photos girl i would share them to
eJg-5i9x66Q,this is so wholesome
eJg-5i9x66Q,and then she thinks she deserves to date joseph
eJg-5i9x66Q,my friend literally dmed joseph saying how they should date not him and doja him and my friend
eJg-5i9x66Q,gotta love the master of puppets
eJg-5i9x66Q,that was such a unbelievable lie that she couldnt find his insta or twitter you can literally google it
eJg-5i9x66Q,joe is not fucking with doja shes all over the place
eJg-5i9x66Q,she hasnt even talked to him yet and shes already ruining his life lmao toxic af joe find a nice english rose
eJg-5i9x66Q,eddie and doja should write music together
eJg-5i9x66Q,no way shes getting joseph now lmao
eJg-5i9x66Q,noah is kind of a jerk for exposing her messages

6CUseqfK3Go,modelling doesnt suit kim but    wen u r famous everything is perfect  no one says the truth kendall  is better

6CUseqfK3Go,balenciaga putting someone that short on the catwalk thats a first then again idk fashion like that
6CUseqfK3Go,remember when she tried to get kendall modeling lessons  whoops

fER90bcYWMo,the intensity at the end from charles is amazing this is gonna be a war both ready to finish or be finished
fER90bcYWMo,damn these fights are going to be the greatest
fER90bcYWMo,this looks absolutely shady even the official doing the weighin looked suspect
fER90bcYWMo,tellement cruel de voir charles oliveira tre dchu de son titre de cette faon
fER90bcYWMo,that roar from charles at the end while flexing was intense
fER90bcYWMo,absolutely heart breaking to see his reign end like this
fER90bcYWMo,i feel for charles to be that close and be over by 05lbstough ive done my fair share of weight cutting and its harder than most can imagine
fER90bcYWMo,the way he reacted tells it all ufc not gonna do anything about it
fER90bcYWMo,mannn i cant wait for these fights
fER90bcYWMo,ill still regard charles as the champ if he wins even though the belt would be vacant
fER90bcYWMo,im going 100 for charles oliveira
fER90bcYWMo,charles is getting screwed multiple fighters now are exposing the flaws in the scale and the ufc is doing nothing about it
fER90bcYWMo,watching the
fER90bcYWMo,it hurts my feelings to see this happen to oliveira damnit
fER90bcYWMo,heart goes out for charles
fER90bcYWMo,never forget the ufc let khabib miss weight when he fought gaethje in abu dhabi the ufc doesnt like oliveira as champion
fER90bcYWMo,tony physically looks damn good look forward to seeing how the fight goes
fER90bcYWMo,am so friggin hyped been a fan of gaethje since he won the wsof title
fER90bcYWMo,something was fishy about that scale charles looks more drained 1 hour later and the weight is exactly the same come on
fER90bcYWMo,absurdo peguem todas as balanas e verifiquem para mim tem algum infeliz por ele ser muito bom se no reverem essa injustia no assisto mais isso  uma covardia
fER90bcYWMo,charles is still the champ if he wins he obviously made weight but the scales were manipulated not even a huge oliveira fan and i can see that
fER90bcYWMo,here we are after that beautiful rnc by charles co is just that dude still  the champ in my book
fER90bcYWMo,give charles his belt back
fER90bcYWMo,i made my mind im routing for oliveira this time
fER90bcYWMo,charles reaction says it all he definitely thought he was at 155
fER90bcYWMo,i dont know why he gets the hate but kamaru usman  the champ  is donating his time and expertise to help a teammate awesome fighter and great guy
fER90bcYWMo,bro that ending ive never seen charles like that i hope he can tame that fire in a weird way im kinda more excited now
fER90bcYWMo,feel bad for charles to get vacant the title but i know for sure its going to be a great match no matter the winner
fER90bcYWMo,that stare down was intense i cant wait for tonight
fER90bcYWMo,i rooting for gaethje the scale issue is suspicious they should at least have done some investigation before deciding to force oliveira to vacate his title on fight night
fER90bcYWMo,the scale was clearly off last week as well so many fighters 5 over championship weight and rob font missed weight justice for font
fER90bcYWMo,congrats to the best lw in the world charles oliveira  nothing but respect for jg but man oliveira is the best
fER90bcYWMo,glad to see charles still in good spirits and fired up ready to go  this will be a banger
fER90bcYWMo,lets go charles i believe in you
fER90bcYWMo,charles seemed to be more fired up after missing weight cant wait for this great card
fER90bcYWMo,keep this in mind guys
fER90bcYWMo,olivera winning this one and the next one to regain the vacant belt would be legendary
fER90bcYWMo,damn i was
fER90bcYWMo,man charles definitely grew on me dude looks like a super villain or something
fER90bcYWMo,dc had the quote of the night that was a field goal to the face dc nailed that one i laughed until i cried
fER90bcYWMo,feels sad for the champ oliveira
fER90bcYWMo,never seen charles so passionate lets go co
fER90bcYWMo,love how they edited out the part where olivera said he was on weight the night prior and in thhe back before going on to the official scale lol
fER90bcYWMo,no matter if he is half a pound or a full pound over or belowjustin is still a great fighter but charles is elite
fER90bcYWMo,idk if its just me but gaethje looks like hes put on a considerable amount of mass since he last fight interesting
fER90bcYWMo,i love charles really rooting for him
fER90bcYWMo,lets go charles
fER90bcYWMo,i just cant not believe in charles
fER90bcYWMo,justicia a oliveira la bscula estba calibrada 5 libras por encima la mayora de los peleadores se pasaron por eso que coincidencia
fER90bcYWMo,lets go charles 
fER90bcYWMo,charles seems more emotional in this staredown than in the ones with dustin poirier and michael chandler
fER90bcYWMo,imagine being in a room beside a ufc fighters room while theyre hitting pads and cutting weight youd either think someone is on their honeymoon or dying
fER90bcYWMo,love how dana asked you good
fER90bcYWMo,vamos tony ferguson argentina est siempre con vos campen saludos desde buenos aires ufc
fER90bcYWMo,missing weight didnt even remotely phase charles he was laser focused even after the fact true champion and still
fER90bcYWMo,usman is such a class athleteteammate p4p king and still helping everyone out around him
fER90bcYWMo,usman is such a nice guy helping his teammates gaethje and chandler train
fER90bcYWMo,i think charles is going to be more pissed off than he ever has before  this fight is about to be unbelievable
fER90bcYWMo,usman is the type of guy that appears on every ufc embedded series
fER90bcYWMo,if charles manages to win tonight hes making history again
fER90bcYWMo,gutted for olivera i hope he gets the w
fER90bcYWMo,that scream from oliveira at the end though
fER90bcYWMo,gaethje said it all with that stare down
fER90bcYWMo,this is gonna be nasty as hell  you good dana  no justin
fER90bcYWMo,carla seems like such a sweetheart hope she does well tonight the fight should be good
fER90bcYWMo,mans working out with a legend  justin is a real one
fER90bcYWMo,just from his body language u can tell oliveira actually thought he made the weight i usually dont believe these things but something must have been wrong with scale
fER90bcYWMo,charles is so unbothered while the media is freaking out
fER90bcYWMo,justice for charles still my champion

Azaf9tKJNoA,i would love to see some numbers regarding the melting point of this builders sand
Azaf9tKJNoA,you cant store electricity in sand but if the temperatures stored remain well above 100 degrees you can heat water and drive turbines to generate electricity on demand fascinating technology
Azaf9tKJNoA,storage heaters are nothing new but this seems like a good implementation of the idea and it may scale up quite well
Azaf9tKJNoA,simple technology is always the best technology same concept as storage heater but on an industrial scale makes you wonder why nobody had done it sooner
Azaf9tKJNoA,i hope theyre talking about sand from deserts because theres no shortage of that but theres already a limited supply of building sand
Azaf9tKJNoA,3 reasons why people stay poor and never become rich
Azaf9tKJNoA,has nobody considered storing heat in oatmeal that stuff stays scolding hot for hours
Azaf9tKJNoA,for curious ones out there the sand is builder sand also known as building sand
Azaf9tKJNoA,i love creativity like this
Azaf9tKJNoA,district heating and combined heat  power systems are really important theyre probably the only technology that will allow us to replace our gas boilers en mass
Azaf9tKJNoA,this is one of those brilliant ideas  500 degrees c is a huge amount of stored energy wonder what the efficiency  losses are
Azaf9tKJNoA,but how efficient is this sand system
Azaf9tKJNoA,it would be interesting to see some numbers like how much energy it takes to charge how much energy it can hold self discharge rate etc
Azaf9tKJNoA,great simple cost effective sustainable solution
Azaf9tKJNoA,thats a brilliant idea the biggest household cost is heating the home
Azaf9tKJNoA,does anybody remember night storage heaters with offpeak electricity were they filled with bricksconcrete i was living in london and we had one in the hall
Azaf9tKJNoA,truly nature can give us what we need and we dont need to destroy it
Azaf9tKJNoA,this looks very promising never hard about it before hope soon we can all be benefited by this innovation
Azaf9tKJNoA,one can convert this heat into thermoelectric energy keeping the lights on at night most spacecraft and rovers use thermoelectric but their heat comes from nuclear fission
Azaf9tKJNoA,they have working prototypes that heat the sand to 1200c then extract the energy via turbines gravity batteries are another simple option thats usable almost anywhere
Azaf9tKJNoA,im confused how does it convert the heat back into electricity at the end the narrator eluded that they couldnt so if it cant then how is it a battery
Azaf9tKJNoA,i had economy 7 brick radiators back in 1998 in my first flat
Azaf9tKJNoA,it could store electricity just by lifting the sand via a cable n tower system and regenerate the electricity by letting it fall back down spinning a turbine
Azaf9tKJNoA,it seems like there should be other mechanical ways to store energy   like huge springs
Azaf9tKJNoA,so the solar energy generated in say the sahara desert can now easily be stored in the widely available sand  no need for expensive batteriesi am already dreaming here
Azaf9tKJNoA,a modern take on a quite old technology  solar active heating has been using thermal mass storage for quite a while
Azaf9tKJNoA,good old practical engineering well done
Azaf9tKJNoA,i dont think that it will be just sand in the future
Azaf9tKJNoA,and now finally some good news for a change
Azaf9tKJNoA,what do you mean can it store electricity if it stores heat that heat can be used to boil water and run a turbine
Azaf9tKJNoA,finland people have much wisdom
Azaf9tKJNoA,we need that in poland we have just like finland been cut off from russian gas and good riddance but we need an alternative
Azaf9tKJNoA,surely no different to storage heaters based on heat storage blocks  the major problem will be the provision of heat insulation to hold back the heat and minimise waste
Azaf9tKJNoA,excellent news well done
Azaf9tKJNoA,passive solar would add to the savings it is more efficient for heating than pv
Azaf9tKJNoA,great news a dutch guy engineered a basalt battery the system is heated up by solar panels and stores the energy for months its called cesar
Azaf9tKJNoA,finally we are open to creativity again thats one advantage of quitting the cheap oil addiction
Azaf9tKJNoA,we had night storage heaters years ago in the uk
Azaf9tKJNoA,bbc news i would like to see you analyze this solution in relation to sand supplies running out worldwide due to high demand for cement the cbc recently covered this
Azaf9tKJNoA,what an awesome concept
Azaf9tKJNoA,this could be an excellent use of all the coloured glass that is never recycled or even ground up building rubble
Azaf9tKJNoA,classthe world is a hostage to oil and anything that breaks that is very
Azaf9tKJNoA,heat doesnt have to come from just solar panels or wind to be stored in sand
Azaf9tKJNoA,this is a thermal battery with sand as medium although i guess sand battery kinda does the trick
Azaf9tKJNoA,hope it works with desert sand finally having a use for that
Azaf9tKJNoA,all these ideas are great but by the time any of them turn into viable working worldwide realities it will be too late
Azaf9tKJNoA,hold on
Azaf9tKJNoA,thank you free thinkers of finland absolutely brilliant
Azaf9tKJNoA,those finnish folk are the main drivers of change thank you
Azaf9tKJNoA,another incredible invention imagine africans can come up with something useful as this imagine
Azaf9tKJNoA,one thing though sand is already in unheard of demandfinite supply the amount of fine sand from fresh water rivers etc for the use of concrete
Azaf9tKJNoA,well done finland
Azaf9tKJNoA,this is a great idea but i thought there was a dire shortage of sand in the world
Azaf9tKJNoA,how do they move the heat in and out how is that heat created by a heat pump or resistance or something else
Azaf9tKJNoA,problem is we are already seeing a decline in sand availability might work if we import from sahara
Azaf9tKJNoA,im guessing solid was relativily way to expensive and difficult to manufacture but is the next stage up for efficiency
Azaf9tKJNoA,gosh id definitely like to see this scale
Azaf9tKJNoA,what an awesome concept
Azaf9tKJNoA,cheap and easy to obtain energy storage with multiple secondary uses
Azaf9tKJNoA,mass storage has been around for thousands of years  why wouldnt they bury it so theyre better insulated and lasts much longer
Azaf9tKJNoA,great idea nd implementation as always the simplest the best
Azaf9tKJNoA,this is amazing idea
Azaf9tKJNoA,this is beyond fascinating
Azaf9tKJNoA,with the heat you can convert back to electricity using thermoelectric generator chips teg

-njHjebtIg4,as a donut mediafan im extremely happy to hear your recognition  theyre great
-njHjebtIg4,good breakdown marques and team  nice to have an overview of all of these marketing strategies in the tech industry 
-njHjebtIg4,has anything elon said come true  been promising full autonomy every year for years
-njHjebtIg4,at this point anyone who knows anything about tesla knows to add 23 years to their dates and scale back all their claims significantly
-njHjebtIg4,man i really wanted more examples of companies actually lying vs all the examples of companies technicallylyingbutnotreally
-njHjebtIg4,also on a power bank they always advertise mah for the 36v batteries that are inside not the actual 5v capacity
-njHjebtIg4,what about when companies say like 12 hours of battery life and then its tested at almost no brightness every setting turned off and only watching a downloaded video
-njHjebtIg4,marques ive to just compliment you on the quality and wide variety of your videoscontent in the last few months great work
-njHjebtIg4,sometimes its just a question of the prmarketing department oversimplifying certain tech specs to the protest of the engineering team
-njHjebtIg4,we need a part two longer please for this topic thanks
-njHjebtIg4,i thank you so much for your intelligent insight into the tech world you keep amazing me brother keep up the great work

8RB6-09T1sk,so after the 5th k bottom of the 4th angels announcer comments can he get a little help from the offensive side next inning he gets an rbi double
8RB6-09T1sk,101 mile fastball and 3 types of sliders and curves  a splitter that disappears further  and he is a home run batter who can run fast  is this a joke
8RB6-09T1sk,the angels are finally winning consistently winning one game a week
8RB6-09T1sk,shohei pitch and ohtani hit its only way for angels to win
8RB6-09T1sk,i had a feeling they were going to split this would have loved to see the alcantara v ohtani match up
8RB6-09T1sk,at this moment shohei would be the lead character if hollywood produced space slam
8RB6-09T1sk,go shohei
8RB6-09T1sk,nice to see a gritty win instead of a limp loss
8RB6-09T1sk,legend shohei ohtani please play baseball for a long time
8RB6-09T1sk,shohei and ohtani are such great team mates always supporting each other on the field
8RB6-09T1sk,should be titled shohei ohtani vs marlins game highlights 7622  mlb highlights
8RB6-09T1sk,good game boys
8RB6-09T1sk,dude shohei deserves a cy young award
8RB6-09T1sk,the los angeles angels are 3845
8RB6-09T1sk,good to see angels hitting well
8RB6-09T1sk,angels win ohtani mvp
8RB6-09T1sk,wouldve loved to see alcantara vs ohtani but perhaps thatll be the matchup in the all star game
8RB6-09T1sk,verlander vs ohtani
8RB6-09T1sk,when i figure out how to clone him were winning the world series
8RB6-09T1sk,shohei now has precisely 13 of his total strike outs in this season 111  total 333
8RB6-09T1sk,angels can only win the game when shohei pitching  not just that he also needs to get enough rbi to for himself to keep the win too
8RB6-09T1sk,angels only play well when ohtani starts
8RB6-09T1sk,lets hope shoheis back is okay from all the carrying hes done
8RB6-09T1sk,finally a win
8RB6-09T1sk,shohei mvp again
8RB6-09T1sk,man i wish i could see shohei in person
8RB6-09T1sk,mvp mode and cy young mode hes from a different planet
8RB6-09T1sk,so shohei starts everyday can probably take the angels to the playoffs
8RB6-09T1sk,will he win the cy or mvp this year
8RB6-09T1sk,without ohtani i seriously think the la franchise would be under threat who would pay the ticket price to watch the rest of those clowns 
8RB6-09T1sk,shohei batting in his own runs is the most shohei thing ever
8RB6-09T1sk,i would love to see shohei in the post season hes been dominant on the mound
8RB6-09T1sk,as an angels fan it was so fun watching him pitch a gem against my second favorite team
8RB6-09T1sk,i think he is kinda superman
8RB6-09T1sk,angel fans should really appreciate what they are seeing from ohtani cause theres no way hes going to resign with this clown show
8RB6-09T1sk,unpopular opinion trade trout keep sho and build around with arms
8RB6-09T1sk,the master took em to school today for sure
8RB6-09T1sk,if there was a major galaxy baseball league ohtani would be the captain of team earth no doubt
8RB6-09T1sk,is he really human
8RB6-09T1sk,hes going to be the cover player for mlb the shoh 2023
8RB6-09T1sk,even if he ends up top 5 in al cy young and top 3 in mvp voting it would be insane
8RB6-09T1sk,show time
8RB6-09T1sk,hoping for the angels to figure it out and get into the postseason
8RB6-09T1sk,best masterpiece htani
8RB6-09T1sk,ohtani loses one point
8RB6-09T1sk,when youre impressed that they get any runs you know its bad
8RB6-09T1sk,mets can sure use ohtani on the team
8RB6-09T1sk,he was transferred to the major leagues from a league of extraterrestrial planets
8RB6-09T1sk,7 ip 10 k wow
8RB6-09T1sk,fun fact marlin have a better record than the angel which have 2 mvp right now
8RB6-09T1sk,nobody can describe exactly how special shohei ohtani is what a monster
8RB6-09T1sk,to go seven innings give up only one run unearned by the waystrike out 10 but also drive in two runs in the same game is absolutely ridiculous
8RB6-09T1sk,shohei carrying much more than atlas angels i love u but you dont deserve him
8RB6-09T1sk,oh my gosh incredible
8RB6-09T1sk,superhuman big showhei once again doing superhuman things all things considered cy young  al mvp are not unthinkable at his rate
8RB6-09T1sk,shohei mvp
8RB6-09T1sk,shohei trout and walsh cant carry the whole teamthe rest needs to step up big time they will lose sho  trout if this keeps up 
8RB6-09T1sk,never wanna see the fish lose but if they have to then it should to amazing performances by players like shohei
8RB6-09T1sk,will he get some run supports
8RB6-09T1sk,needs a special award mvp is not fitting for what shohei can do maybe the ohtani award
8RB6-09T1sk,ohtani amazing
8RB6-09T1sk,alright angels theres your 1 win limit 10 more games till your next prescription can be filled
8RB6-09T1sk,hey shoheilets go to the dodgers
8RB6-09T1sk,rogers missed that pitch to ohtani that scored 2 runs you cant throw an outside fastball into a lefty when yall have the shift on
8RB6-09T1sk,shohei with another great outing and good to see ohtani helping him out tonight as well
8RB6-09T1sk,hes gona win back to back mvps lol
8RB6-09T1sk,this team doesnt deserve ohtani angels better hope and pray ohtani doesnt leave them after his contract expires
8RB6-09T1sk,angels vs marlins
8RB6-09T1sk,miami marlins average home attendance for wednesday games this season 7950 fans
8RB6-09T1sk,i hope shohei keeps his back healthy all this carrying could really wear on the guy
8RB6-09T1sk,anyone ever got cy young award and mvp at the same time
8RB6-09T1sk,another wasted year no postseason for the angels
8RB6-09T1sk,shohei just on a different level i truly think he is the best player in mlb over trout
8RB6-09T1sk,go ohtani
8RB6-09T1sk,watching history
8RB6-09T1sk,angeles vs miami
8RB6-09T1sk,im proud of japan
8RB6-09T1sk,thank you shohei
8RB6-09T1sk,angels rock 
8RB6-09T1sk,shohei killed it but where has jazz been for the marlins
8RB6-09T1sk,that slider was nasty
8RB6-09T1sk,astros are the angels daddy
8RB6-09T1sk,how did it take them this long to upload the gamewhat a joke
_T_UPY5qxb0,thank you for this i have heard this several times and have been stocking up for some time now but some people arent because they dont believe it is happening
_T_UPY5qxb0,i work with farmers in alabama they all tell me shortages are coming next year  since no one can find fertilizer and those that can find it cant afford it

AjQ7CEeONb4,the best part was to watch this without having youtube premium
AjQ7CEeONb4,the fact that its still around today is proof of its durability
AjQ7CEeONb4,my sony walkman helped me keep my sanity while deployed remotely in desert storm  its the small things in life that matter  having your music is part of the soul
AjQ7CEeONb4,aw man seeing that mixtape brought back the memory i totally forgot about how we used to speak to each other in the language of song names lol
AjQ7CEeONb4,it was an honor to test ancient tech with you and sing about being on firewhich the sony would probably survive
AjQ7CEeONb4,first time i ever heard headphones was on a walkman
AjQ7CEeONb4,man the mixtape part is so important making a tape for your girlfriend was a real thing in the 90s thumbs up
AjQ7CEeONb4,i had several of those different models to be sure
AjQ7CEeONb4,this is an awesome series love seeing old tech brings back so much nostalgia
AjQ7CEeONb4,1979 these damn kids with their loud boomboxes being obnoxious
AjQ7CEeONb4,marques normally i have been using this for a while now
AjQ7CEeONb4,you make brilliant tech videos marques
AjQ7CEeONb4,in 30 years someone is going to be doing this video with airpods
AjQ7CEeONb4,another advantage of the walkman is that you really listen to the whole songs and not just skip halfway through
AjQ7CEeONb4,back in the days where making a mix tape was a legit skill
AjQ7CEeONb4,born in 2001 but still experiencing the walkman because cassette tapes is still popular in indonesia till the early 2010s
AjQ7CEeONb4,that first walkman still looks awesome
AjQ7CEeONb4,mkbhd really making waves again with the tech that changed our world and society
AjQ7CEeONb4,the coolest thing about this video for me was to see how the sport that marcus does is cool and makes me want to practice
AjQ7CEeONb4,once i made a whole album only using the miclinein of an old walkman i love this old hardware analogic is 100 times cooler than digital
AjQ7CEeONb4,god this brings back memories of listening to books on tape while walking around my neighborhood walking dogs for a few bucks lol
AjQ7CEeONb4,of all the great videos on this channel
AjQ7CEeONb4,this novelty is a great idea and i truely enjoyed every moment of it
AjQ7CEeONb4,i absolutely love this series its crazy i am 46 yrs old now and i had one as a a matter affect i sill have some of these at home
AjQ7CEeONb4,im too young for the cassette version but i did have a cd walkman with the big purple window thing on the front man that thing was cool
AjQ7CEeONb4,this is probably the only time my youtube premium became useful
AjQ7CEeONb4,hermoso video que lindo era tener un walkman
AjQ7CEeONb4,i love old tech
AjQ7CEeONb4,what a fantastic piece of kit this was paved the way for portable music this series is great we need a season 2
AjQ7CEeONb4,wow this brings back so many memories of my childhood i had several walkmans from the early 80s into the mid 90s
AjQ7CEeONb4,as big as the empire state building and as loud as world war ii if that isnt the greatest description of anything ever
AjQ7CEeONb4,truly excellent content pretty refreshing to still find great content made
AjQ7CEeONb4,i remember always wanting one when i was a child but they were too expensive now that i can afford one i cant find one
AjQ7CEeONb4,oh yeah i remember my first walkman in 1987 god how i loved that thing
AjQ7CEeONb4,the walkman made people back in the 80s antisocial
AjQ7CEeONb4,nice love this take on old tech keep em coming
AjQ7CEeONb4,that was awesome i grew up throughout all these eras was a great time to be alive as new things were being invented
AjQ7CEeONb4,the effort this guy puts into youtube videos is insane
AjQ7CEeONb4,context kids back then were used to repairing a lot of equipment generally a broken walkman was just another thing to repair
AjQ7CEeONb4,that was really cool thanks for making videos like this
AjQ7CEeONb4,i wouldnt have been surprised if this was a yt premium series mkbhd made something amazing as always
AjQ7CEeONb4,thanks for making this video for those lucky to have used this it brings back memories
AjQ7CEeONb4,im japanese
AjQ7CEeONb4,i would still be rockin those hope that sony will produce walkman again
AjQ7CEeONb4,great video  plus very original and well done congrats
AjQ7CEeONb4,this content is definitely refreshing learning where our digital age came from
AjQ7CEeONb4,the ipod did not kill the walkman the diskman killed it waaaaaaay before the ipod the ipod killed the diskman
AjQ7CEeONb4,kind of funny to see reviews of tech with far superior sound quality to todays saying its sounds not too bad
AjQ7CEeONb4,awesome work marques keep going 
AjQ7CEeONb4,lol this is hilarious seeing children react to these standard products like they havent used them before
AjQ7CEeONb4,dude i love these retro tech videos
AjQ7CEeONb4,awesome video gotta admit i did have one in the 90s great memories ability to make personal mixtapes was the best
rI_im3wm9nI,integrity morals and the ability not to tell lies would be my prerequisite for a pm can the conservative party find one
rI_im3wm9nI,pm do i need to deliver on my promise to voters
rI_im3wm9nI,the country will rue this day
rI_im3wm9nI,genuine question if there was an election tomorrow why would you vote conservative
rI_im3wm9nI,thats not a resignation hes basically saying he wont run for another term
rI_im3wm9nI,if he is humiliated he hides it well  all ive seen is narcissistic behaviour known  proven lies and living in an alternate universe to what hes preaching
rI_im3wm9nI,ironically hes actually talking clearly on the last speech hes ever gonna give as pm
rI_im3wm9nI,you know whats funnier than this people thinking replacing him will change how the world is going
rI_im3wm9nI,he went back inside to tell his children its everyone elses fault and their all being mean and jealous of how clever handsome and muscular daddy is
rI_im3wm9nI,somehow i dont think hes humiliated
rI_im3wm9nI,the amount of people that are regularly inside that building is ridiculous
rI_im3wm9nI,all the talk over his humilation most the country was being humiliated by him in the pms position
rI_im3wm9nI,i like this forced from power  it was annoying me everyone saying he resigned
rI_im3wm9nI,did she say theyd regret it like they did thatcher
rI_im3wm9nI,the speech i wanted to hear from boris
rI_im3wm9nI,he may be steeping down from power but his hair has definitely been stepping up in volume
rI_im3wm9nI,to those who voted for him and were surprised and appalled by his actions you have not been paying attention
rI_im3wm9nI,who would have thought boris johnson of all people would be booted out of this job under a cloud of controversy humiliation and scandal
rI_im3wm9nI,all politicians are full of lies get them all out and start fresh with decent respectful humans
rI_im3wm9nI,humiliated boris thats the objective and super professional british press speaking lol
rI_im3wm9nI,im not sure he is humilated at all lol
rI_im3wm9nI,now if only pms and leaders of some other nations would resign or be removed from their dictatorships
rI_im3wm9nI,egomania on full display with the inherent lack of insight that others allowed such a wretched character to make his way to the top is where the real blame lies
rI_im3wm9nI,well its like this
rI_im3wm9nI,got to love the bbc  brilliant politically neutral coverage
rI_im3wm9nI,i think to be humiliated you need humility i wont believe hes gone until he turns in the keys that includes the secret copy he made at timpson
rI_im3wm9nI,a peaceful transition of power the most important indication of a true democracy i love it
rI_im3wm9nI,if only he actually delivered the mandate on which he was elected he had an 80 majority he could have implemented what he wanted but he did eff all
rI_im3wm9nI,disgusting to hear the bbc commentators gleeful comments showing how biased the bbc really is now
rI_im3wm9nI,the country will rue this day
rI_im3wm9nI,this man got us through brexit even though he voted against it
rI_im3wm9nI,we are always with neutral and intellectual media
rI_im3wm9nI,it was hard for me to leave my job my country and my friends thanks to his brexit plans humiliated it sounds fine with me
rI_im3wm9nI,many who voted conservative for the first time in the last election were lied to and became delusional
rI_im3wm9nI,i just pray the same happens with our draghi here in italydeliver us from evil
rI_im3wm9nI,you gotta hand it to him he has a perfect record of being sacked or forced out of every job he has ever had
rI_im3wm9nI,fun fact the people leaving his cabinet are the same who supported the lockdown plan 
rI_im3wm9nI,i thought it was hilarious being able to hear bye bye baby in the distance during his resignation speech
rI_im3wm9nI,we want peoples vote
rI_im3wm9nI,did one of them genuinely just say theyll regret it like they did with thatcher how insanely out of touch can they be
rI_im3wm9nI,if we get a generational leader out of this id be very pleasantly surprised
rI_im3wm9nI,we still need a full public enquiry into the midazolam scandal in care homes and rendesivear in hospitals
rI_im3wm9nI,he wasnt forced from poweror anything
rI_im3wm9nI,a man who can not even comb his hairmust be a politician
rI_im3wm9nI,he feels sorry for himself
rI_im3wm9nI,working on boris like this is an incredible waste of valuable time and energy for the uk and the world
rI_im3wm9nI,in order to be the chief you have to be the toughest thats the only standard we go by
rI_im3wm9nI,daunting to find an honest democratic leader even in britain  let alone in the conservative party
rI_im3wm9nI,its a mystery how he persuaded british people to vote for him he had few good jokes and a pompous accent but not much else
rI_im3wm9nI,i think his hairdresser should hold some accountability like he looks like he has been dragged through a hedge backwards and than attacked by a vacuum cleaner
rI_im3wm9nI,from the begining i was wondering how do british people think and they voted for this man
rI_im3wm9nI,thems the breaks best parting words ever
rI_im3wm9nI,none  of the conservative  party thats left are  worth a tosswe need  a different  party  altogether
rI_im3wm9nI,its unfair this gentleman have accomplish so much and put england on the path of independence
rI_im3wm9nI,calls the opposition to him the herd really  still arrogant in defeat
rI_im3wm9nI,political turmoil abound around the world all power to the righteous
rI_im3wm9nI,boris the will of the parliament not the will of the people
rI_im3wm9nI,boris johnson  will always  be a big hero
rI_im3wm9nI,this needs to be done in the us before we are all ruined
rI_im3wm9nI,this gives real meaning to the expression
rI_im3wm9nI,the backstabbing disloyal traitors who will regret what they have done
rI_im3wm9nI,thesecurity service also known asmi5military intelligence section 5is the united kingdoms domesticcounterintelligenceand security agency and is part of its intelligence machinery alongside thesecret intelligence servicemi6government communications headquartersgchq anddefence intelligencedi
rI_im3wm9nI,really dark days ahead  lets see the other mps do better
rI_im3wm9nI,he speaks like a head of year at yr 7 school assembly
rI_im3wm9nI,the irony is that boris thought he was indispensable i suppose all narcissists think like that 
rI_im3wm9nI,he has a lot of guts and keeps his cool he does have the bullshit to be a leader he is persuasive and charismatic
rI_im3wm9nI,boris johnson i really like this  im still prime minister aint i  maybe ill never have to leave 
rI_im3wm9nI,he didnt live his life the way of the lord  now he will reap the misery from the seeds of sin he has sown
rI_im3wm9nI,the uk should decide to be independent or become the 51st us state at the moment it is like a watchdog without dignity
rI_im3wm9nI,thank goodness hes finally resignedhe was a complete joke to begin with
uSCIDRp37jc,manthis feels like some nba finals shit
uSCIDRp37jc,last seasons lakers continue to demonstrate good things in the defence especially in the end of game
uSCIDRp37jc,scotty pippen jr summer league numbers so far roster spot coming this year
uSCIDRp37jc,been some really good games this summer league
uSCIDRp37jc,so mad i missed this game   amazing game by jt n richards great all around effort
uSCIDRp37jc,great work from all why did we let go of mac mcclung the dude killed it for the warriors today
uSCIDRp37jc,pippin is a baller problem is once the season start you wont even see them playing
uSCIDRp37jc,good efforts by both teams great game
uSCIDRp37jc,hornets never gave up so many moments where i thought it was over and somehow they pulled it out alexander is so clutch and deserves a medal
uSCIDRp37jc,cole swider looks like a nba starter  he has a pure jumpshot reminds me of a young klay thompson
uSCIDRp37jc,tyshon alexander  lj figueroa were the best on the floor hands down
uSCIDRp37jc,so stoked to hear jellos back howd he do 20pts 30pts
uSCIDRp37jc,lakers definitely need my boy from syracuse swider he can shoot the ball and is a solid rebounder and defender
uSCIDRp37jc,sacha jones is about to be on the 13 man laker roster with how well hes playing
uSCIDRp37jc,im liking summer league more than nba rn
uSCIDRp37jc,lakers now have a  promising roster consisting of this summer league squad plus lebron and ad
uSCIDRp37jc,i think lakers need keep fighting
uSCIDRp37jc,swider and pip jr definitely need to be signed
uSCIDRp37jc,lakers coaching staff needs to learn from this
uSCIDRp37jc,pippen jr swider and huff should be locked in for the nba roster
uSCIDRp37jc,hornets need to sign figueroa and alexander
uSCIDRp37jc,that swider guys a sniper waiting for him to be on the main stage
uSCIDRp37jc,scotty pippen jr
uSCIDRp37jc,we need to sign swider pippenjr and jay huff asap
uSCIDRp37jc,yall talking about the wrong guy
uSCIDRp37jc,awesome play by the la lakers
uSCIDRp37jc,cole swider is what lakers need
uSCIDRp37jc,lakers demise tonight wasyou guessed it  defense in crunch time
uSCIDRp37jc,tyshon alexander is a baller hornets please sign him
uSCIDRp37jc,i was at the game it was tough but we coming back next year
uSCIDRp37jc,was nice to se gelo playing again i feel like him and lame lol are gonna be a dynamic duo
uSCIDRp37jc,scotty pippens son is actually a solid player
uSCIDRp37jc,swider on fiyahhhhhh
uSCIDRp37jc,scottie pippin jr deserve spots in lakers
uSCIDRp37jc,this was a very close game on both ends
uSCIDRp37jc,i refuse to believe pippen jr went undrafted dudes a baller
uSCIDRp37jc,lets stick to the basketball court tho and another three goes down for miles bridges lmaooooo i started crying
uSCIDRp37jc,lj figueroa is a star always been since young
uSCIDRp37jc,holy this was a good game 2 ots in summer league
uSCIDRp37jc,if 2nd ot is sudden death why even put 10mins on the clock all you need is the shot clock
uSCIDRp37jc,i want pippen jr to start as our point guard hes already better then westbrick
uSCIDRp37jc,lakers team looking good already
uSCIDRp37jc,if slider can increase his vert he could be incredible maybe even pushing all star calibur
uSCIDRp37jc,hornets looking real good
uSCIDRp37jc,lj is a beast
uSCIDRp37jc,way to go hornets
uSCIDRp37jc,lakers scooped up a lot of udfa gems
uSCIDRp37jc,thor with the hammer  i see what u did there
uSCIDRp37jc,swider looks like a keeper dont pippen jr was that impressive good tonight not familiar with bass
uSCIDRp37jc,thors clutch great comecack
uSCIDRp37jc,damn the lakers sat their all around big down for the rest of summer league i need to see more of number 30
uSCIDRp37jc,i dont like that format because its based on luck to win like charlotte did at the end of the game
uSCIDRp37jc,swider gonna get real mi uses this season with that shot
uSCIDRp37jc,we have some missing pieces but all in all the hornets are heading in the right direction
uSCIDRp37jc,purple n gold solid no matter what happened mamba mentally
uSCIDRp37jc,we need swider
uSCIDRp37jc,swider really swoosh lights out
uSCIDRp37jc,pipen and the number 21 always delivered
uSCIDRp37jc,this feels like nick richards 5th summer league appearance
uSCIDRp37jc,another 3 goes does for miles bridges
uSCIDRp37jc,that last point wins is makes you really play defense imo but i rather just give them 1 minute and just let it play out
uSCIDRp37jc,let shareef get more playing time
uSCIDRp37jc,already looks like hornets made mistake by not keeping duren and where is reeves
uSCIDRp37jc,lakers as a organisation is doomed
uSCIDRp37jc,more like a 10 minute laker highlight reel  no love for
uSCIDRp37jc,that boy swider gonna see play time this season everyone else is a scrub
uSCIDRp37jc,swider  gonna be a problem boi
uSCIDRp37jc,lj  figueroa  has been  shooting  very  good
uSCIDRp37jc,wts wrong with the shot
uSCIDRp37jc,these young guys play better than the 2021 lakers team lol
uSCIDRp37jc,awesome game nba style foreal
uSCIDRp37jc,pippen and swider earning themselves contracts for sure
uSCIDRp37jc,they better give swider some serious burn this year
uSCIDRp37jc,tyshon been doin this since creighton 
uSCIDRp37jc,why wasnt gelo on the court the hornets needed his 3s

HRU2LFfh2kY,i look forward to when she finds out what video made her mom famous thats stop sign is going to be huge
HRU2LFfh2kY,i love yamuris dress with the tan bra cups glued to the outside of her black dress
HRU2LFfh2kY,her kid is having a public freak out with the stop sign to invasive photographers and the mother is saying haa how funny and cute it is sick
HRU2LFfh2kY,north should point that sign at kim saying stop exploiting me
HRU2LFfh2kY,bendiciones hermosa celina que dios te cuidec donde quiera que
HRU2LFfh2kY,bendiciones hermosa celina que dios te cuidez donde quiera que
HRU2LFfh2kY,kim is wrong for this disgusting really 
HRU2LFfh2kY,bendiciones hermosa celina que dios te cuidel donde quiera que

HRU2LFfh2kY,her antics will actually bring more attention to herselfso it aint working
HRU2LFfh2kY,both their nose rings look stupid and inappropriate for norths age
HRU2LFfh2kY,i think the stop sign was meant for her moms ridiculous outfit
HRU2LFfh2kY,does a 9 yr old needs those boots let her be a kid
HRU2LFfh2kY,no kid should be in adult space 
HRU2LFfh2kY,essa north  insuportvel ela no deveria estar ali mas a me conserteza  a obrigou a ir sabe que essa menina  estranha quem sabe a chicago  diferente

8hp1TEUqvW4,i wouldnt be able to sleep knowing i paid over 500cdn for a sleep tracker
8hp1TEUqvW4,this is a luxury product the subscription killed it at the door 
8hp1TEUqvW4,anyway with a comfortable strap and the sleep as android app my watch active 2 can do all of that without costing over 300 and without a 599 subscription service
8hp1TEUqvW4,really cool ring love all this new tech coming out we need more competing companies to drive the prices down a bit though
8hp1TEUqvW4,i would love to have an integrated nfc chip in this ring that would be the ultimate daily accessory
8hp1TEUqvW4,im curious about the durability of the ring when used working out i lift weights and this seems bulky to have on my hand
8hp1TEUqvW4,a 299 usd product with a 699 usd monthly subscription fee no thank you
8hp1TEUqvW4,good thing about a ring tracker is that i can finally wear my watchestime pieces while keeping my tracking data
8hp1TEUqvW4,ive had the gen 2 of this ring for a couple of years now wearing the gen 3 just got it a few weeks ago very good
8hp1TEUqvW4,you got to appreciate finnish technology and design have this on my shopping list for q1
8hp1TEUqvW4,as a person who prefers to only wear traditional watches this is exactly something i could use for tracking
8hp1TEUqvW4,i have gen 2 oura and love this thing its very accurate
8hp1TEUqvW4,looking forward to picking one of these up and giving it a try
8hp1TEUqvW4,thanks for the review question can you pair the ring for example to a cycling computer through bluetooth
8hp1TEUqvW4,it would be impressive if it could do oxygen saturation  every other sleep tracker on the market can do what this does
8hp1TEUqvW4,really nice piece of tech hope it has water resistance
8hp1TEUqvW4,this would be great  i need tracking and i really would love to wear a normal wind up watch instead of my smartwatch
8hp1TEUqvW4,i wish we were best friends bro absolutely love what you do in the space
8hp1TEUqvW4,im looking for a long time for finding something wearable and easy to hold  has a goooood battery life
8hp1TEUqvW4,love this detailed data and idea of a ring as opposed to wrist devices
8hp1TEUqvW4,love your videos keep em coming
8hp1TEUqvW4,cool idea one ring to rule them all
8hp1TEUqvW4,i was thinking of getting one of these rings for myself now i think more seriously thanks dude
8hp1TEUqvW4,too expensive but seems like a great idea for me
8hp1TEUqvW4,nice little tech you got there buddy 
8hp1TEUqvW4,this is so cool love this
8hp1TEUqvW4,lew makes even the drop and ketch look so smooth
8hp1TEUqvW4,was tempted until i saw there is a subscription to make it work after handling over 300400 to purchase it
8hp1TEUqvW4,sounds interesting i would like to get one but how durable is it because im in construction and i dont want to get it destroyed after 3 days of work
8hp1TEUqvW4,great to see that in small package but this data and information have been on sports watches for very long time garmin is the king there
8hp1TEUqvW4,great product however its a shame theyre locking anything useful behind a subscription was going to get one but the subscription ruins it for me
8hp1TEUqvW4,this is freaking awesome i read about this ring
8hp1TEUqvW4,i just hope one day i can have a warehouse to be my studio for unboxing and product review
8hp1TEUqvW4,honestly just want something like this that i wear and tap with my thumb to activate google home so i dont have to say hey google
8hp1TEUqvW4,it looks impressive
8hp1TEUqvW4,damn thats cool and i need some fitness tracker but man subscription is a dealbreaker for sure
8hp1TEUqvW4,quite cool to see that a ring now can measure the psychological signals of your body and gives you accurate data on how youve slept the previous night
8hp1TEUqvW4,truly hope apple come with thing like this sometimes in the near future  would love to replace the watch from time to time
8hp1TEUqvW4,would be great if they combined it with bank cards so you can use it to pay
8hp1TEUqvW4,the price is actually pretty decent
8hp1TEUqvW4,well see how long hell continue to wear it
8hp1TEUqvW4,well it would have been absolute killer if it also had nfc
8hp1TEUqvW4,cmon do you really believe the ring can do all that stuff accurately pretty dangerous in my opinion
8hp1TEUqvW4,ive worn the oura ring for two years now and i love it its the first thing i check every morning highly recommended
8hp1TEUqvW4,i dont even wear watches because it is uncomfortable this looks interesting indeed
8hp1TEUqvW4,this device is cool wish i could have one
8hp1TEUqvW4,one ring to rule them all one ring to find them one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them
8hp1TEUqvW4,i dont wear rings but this is the one that i definitely would
8hp1TEUqvW4,just need to know the scratch resistance its got a beautiful finish a shame to scuff and ruin that especially cos i do indoor  rock climbing
8hp1TEUqvW4,looks to be a good idea
8hp1TEUqvW4,this video has some deep meaning that his common audience cannot understand yet  nice video
8hp1TEUqvW4,is it water proof or resistent  for showers and such
8hp1TEUqvW4,problem with a ring is if wearing it whilst doing weights there is a good chance it will get damaged
8hp1TEUqvW4,dont get me wrong it is really expensive aaa lot of money
8hp1TEUqvW4,i have this ring its cool its super annoying to rip it off your finger every few days and charge it and remember to put it back on
8hp1TEUqvW4,as an engineer  dayum
8hp1TEUqvW4,your videos are mind blowing

5lWb8sJR_Jg,surprised to see so many yankees fans at pnc park you know there arent many pirates fans that show up terrible ownership does that to a fan base
5lWb8sJR_Jg,fuhhh watching the pirates beat the yanks made me laugh and cough a lot
5lWb8sJR_Jg,4 commercial breaks in 8 minutes one at the start one at the end two during the video it wont even let you skip most of them

Ae380UObjus,i didnt buy the putins price hike for a second even before he was done saying it i was calling bs
Ae380UObjus,we americans might not be buying his bullshyt but we are definitely paying for it
Ae380UObjus,i drove past a local cemetery and even the residents there dont buy bidens  putin price hike
Ae380UObjus,of course we dont buy it maybe the 32 who favor the president might buy it but the rest of us are not stupid
Ae380UObjus,great questions by the guestworst incompetence ever by a us president didnt believe it could ever be this bad in us  worry if we will make it to 2024
Ae380UObjus,im no fan of putin at the moment but i dont believe its his fault that our leaders are choosing not to use our own resources
Ae380UObjus,this is what happens america when you get a mail in president
Ae380UObjus,we in the bahamas are missing donald trump cant wait for 2024
Ae380UObjus,i feel like im in an episode of the twilight zone seriously this corruption is out for all to see yet nobody is doing anything
Ae380UObjus,just remember biden is so well love and respected yt had to disable the dislike button counter
Ae380UObjus,the best and most efficient way to fight inflation is to vote out of power the democrat party this november
Ae380UObjus,bidens crowd shows up in the 10s
Ae380UObjus,states are required by law to prosecute acts of treason
Ae380UObjus,this country is being run like a bad comedy dumb  dumber 2022
Ae380UObjus,everything that is done on the political side should be disclosed to america if politicians argue against this they are hiding something 
Ae380UObjus,1 of autos in the us are evs and we cant charge them at the same time 
Ae380UObjus,props to murray for calling out schwab and the wef
Ae380UObjus,americas a nation that can be defined in a single word awdsmfafoothimaaafootafootwhscuseme
Ae380UObjus,democrat failure and embarrassment  on full display thank you brandon  and when common sense does not prevail anymore this is the end result of a mindless democrat cornpop administration
Ae380UObjus,biden might as well blame iceland
Ae380UObjus,all the ridin with biden folks real quiet now
Ae380UObjus,we are not idiots i cant wait for november
Ae380UObjus,if the republicans would promise to actually punish crimes and drain the swamp for reali would rally  door to door
Ae380UObjus,cmon man no jokeim the best president in us history my son the smartest man ive ever known told me so
Ae380UObjus,it would be absolutely shocking if joey duhmass told the truth about anything
Ae380UObjus,32  bidens support rating my god  ie these people hearing about putins price hike nod approvingly to him
Ae380UObjus,hard to believe he has canceled my oil without authorization  and selling my oil to china without authorization and profiting from it while i go without
Ae380UObjus,the laptop is one thing the diary is another
Ae380UObjus,sleepy joe wont remember that he was even president let alone his own name
Ae380UObjus,lets go brandon 
Ae380UObjus,come on man look heres the dealend of quote repeat the line joe biden 07092022
Ae380UObjus,worst president lets go brandon
Ae380UObjus,bidens the type of person that gets hit by a parked car enough is enough
Ae380UObjus,gonna be a lot of trouble soon  this is a kettle set to boil 
Ae380UObjus,the one thing obama was absolutely correct on
Ae380UObjus,its hard to convince people that things they feel every day doesnt exist
Ae380UObjus,nobody cares hunter is clearly the smartest person we know cos he just keeps getting away with anything and right under our nose too it bloody amazing
Ae380UObjus,oil hunter worse than crack joe must need money after paying for hunters bills oh wait they pay each others bills
Ae380UObjus,ladies and gentlemen  the national embarassment worst president in american history
Ae380UObjus,if trump had done this he already wouldve been impeached  in both sides of congress 
Ae380UObjus,i just wonder if hunter being at the whitehouse last week had anything to do with the oil shipment to his partners in china
Ae380UObjus,what a shame when the president of the free world cant accept his dutiful responsibility or have a moment of clarity its a let down
Ae380UObjus,getting his  hunters kickbacks
Ae380UObjus,the only one who believe his lies its brandon himself
Ae380UObjus,joe putin tshirts would be a hot seller right about now
Ae380UObjus,demented joe is only coherent when they give him a short
Ae380UObjus,politicians are making themselves millionaires while average americans suffer
Ae380UObjus,the easiest way to identify the problem is get rid of every single politician who has a d after there names problem solved
Ae380UObjus,orange man bad but i had way more  in my bank account  fjb
Ae380UObjus,putin is looking out for the best interests of his country our president is looking out for the best interests of ukraine and china and saudi arabia
Ae380UObjus,its not ironic in the slightest that the bumblers campaign slogan was
Ae380UObjus,i would be surprised if anyone has believed anything from the start even before the office was acquired
Ae380UObjus,whoever comes to us with a sword will die from the sword  anevsky
Ae380UObjus,time to get that order in for christmas the biden face dartboard will be a top item theyll be way more popular than he is
Ae380UObjus,not my president
Ae380UObjus,you see the mainstream media asking why putin never mention navalny but never ask why biden dont mention the lap top
Ae380UObjus,how can an administration collectively be not only incompetent but also blatantly ignorant about history reality and cause and effect
Ae380UObjus,stop paying them  thats the only thing theyll understand  arrest this whole administration accountability
Ae380UObjus,buying it
Ae380UObjus,love douglas murray always has a really good perspective on things very knowledgeable about a lot of subjects
Ae380UObjus,now hes going to blame pony toy soldiers
Ae380UObjus,id still like to actually see some polls that ask point blank do you believe bidens reasons for anything that is wrong in the us right now
Ae380UObjus,first it was russia russia russia now its putin putin putin one thing you can say about the devil hes not very original
Ae380UObjus,imagine all the tax payers money being laundered in ukraine from our elected officials
Ae380UObjus,i still havent figured out why its greener to import the oil we use
Ae380UObjus,the problem was that too many of the dead voted for biden
Ae380UObjus,i like murray but he does go around the houses to make a point
Ae380UObjus,putins price hike end quote repeat the line hahaha
Ae380UObjus,sadly hunter won the presidency
Ae380UObjus,not one vote for one democratic after what we have seen from the democratic party
Ae380UObjus,thanks brian and douglas great analysis and information
Ae380UObjus,unfortunately its too late hes kicked us over the edge we may never recover from this president hyper inflation famine and fuel shortages are coming like a tidal wave
Ae380UObjus,joe bidens price hike sounds more convincing
Ae380UObjus,the fact that he shut down keystone and allowed the nordstream 2 to continue should have booted him out of office immediately
Ae380UObjus,putins price hike started jan21 2021 pretty sure i get it
Ae380UObjus,the world will be destroyed not by those who do evil but by those who watch them without doing anything
Ae380UObjus,i wouldnt buy an apple from him on the corner even if his whole family is homeless
Ae380UObjus,americans have the power to change this nightmare but oddly enough everyone is sitting back on social media and complaining
Ae380UObjus,good piece brian   and thanks for bringing on douglas murray
Ae380UObjus,i would love to see his numbers in the 20s
Ae380UObjus,yeah boris took ukraine so seriously that he ordered uk reps at the un council to block the discussion of the bucha setup
Ae380UObjus,the democrats need to put the brakes on this guy  and put him in retirement now
Ae380UObjus,if you have to be persuaded reminded bullied pressured

V2fn7GVkQFo,come on people i am not the only one but at
V2fn7GVkQFo,england  germany the best team in this tournament
V2fn7GVkQFo,some great players on show from both sides england potentially against spain a win is only 3 points whatever the score interesting
V2fn7GVkQFo,popp is actually quite decent
V2fn7GVkQFo,rooting for u germany
V2fn7GVkQFo,germany is so strong and spain needs years and years to challenge them
V2fn7GVkQFo,so it seems spain lose their talismanic captain and theyre no use the old saying that one player doesnt make a team isnt true in spains case
V2fn7GVkQFo,ilse marie remember that your brothers let you join them to enjoy the skills of playing in a team

U368lNrisZI,so which feature do you want most on javabedrock be sure to subscribe and leave a comment
U368lNrisZI,this seems perfect for servers you can use classroom mode for events barrier blocks for secrets and map edges allow blocks deny blocks immutable worlds and its all very easy
U368lNrisZI,as a person who mains this version its great seeing people give it some attention it deserves
U368lNrisZI,you havent experienced pure annoyance until youve experienced education edition lag
U368lNrisZI,some of these features including npcs barriers and allowdeny are in bedrock addition with commands
U368lNrisZI,the allow deny and npc features are actually in base bedrock edition theyre just pretty hidden as they can only be obtained via commands
U368lNrisZI,honestly some of the features in education edition would be really cool if they were in the vanilla game
U368lNrisZI,great video i didnt know about many of these the balloons are easily my favorite feature and i hope they get added to both bedrock and java edition
U368lNrisZI,just wanted to mention that you can enable education edition on bedrock so you can have the updates with these features
U368lNrisZI,complains about ludicrous crafting recipes but has likely memorised all 600 crafting recipes in the base game
U368lNrisZI,bedrock actually already has npcs without toggling education features and they are pretty useful
U368lNrisZI,tragic that this has so many features thatd be great to have in regular versions of minecraft hopefully they come to said regular versions very soon
U368lNrisZI,i feel like we should all be able to access this version it seems elaborate and quite enjoyable
U368lNrisZI,border allow and deny blocks are all in regular bedrock but you have to use give
U368lNrisZI,you know a tutorial is great when it contains such a big error as the program crashing
U368lNrisZI,there is a setting in bedrock where you can turn on some of the education exclusive blocks and items
U368lNrisZI,ive always wondered what allow blocks do since you can obtain them with commands in bedrock edition
U368lNrisZI,actually allow blocks also lets you place blocks on them in adventure also allow deny and border blocks have all been added to the base game of bedrock
U368lNrisZI,i wasnt sold until classroom mode holy crap that would make the barrier of entry for servers so low as well as hosting small private servers less of a pain
U368lNrisZI,not perfect for java but a lot of features i would probably have fun with in java compared to recent updates
U368lNrisZI,hey i really like your content each video is very interesting and rather informative very good production quality
U368lNrisZI,the teacher features and multiplayer hosting in the same pc would be awesome for aerver control there sould be in vanilla
U368lNrisZI,something worth mentioning is how you can turn this on in bedrocks settings which is good
U368lNrisZI,actually the border deny and allow blocks is also available on bedrock using commands
U368lNrisZI,finally someone who acknowledges this amazing type of minecraft as someone who only has this i can agree
U368lNrisZI,i have education edition features enabled on my creative realm hardened glass is indeed very useful for building and we use npcs very frequently
U368lNrisZI,wow ive heard mc was use in some edu institution fascinating im really surprised with the versatility and flexability  this game  offers
U368lNrisZI,several of these features are in bedrock naturally using some commands but if you want more you can add more using the education edition toggle
U368lNrisZI,man i really wanna see these features coming to java in someway the underwater tnt and torches could be obtained from the ocean temple in some way
U368lNrisZI,actually if you enable a certain setting when creating a world in standard minecraft bedrock you can get the chemistry stuff those colored toches glowsticks etc
U368lNrisZI,i remember playing around with the underwater tnt the balloons and other stuff in there years ago good stuff
U368lNrisZI,fun fact the camera was in pocket edition for some time before it was removed it was only obtainable through creative mode and didnt do anything
U368lNrisZI,the chemistry part got me inspired to make a mod like that
U368lNrisZI,i would genuinely listen to this man complain about education edition crafting recipes for hours
U368lNrisZI,themisterepic drink an eye drop to cure blindnes
U368lNrisZI,i remember celebrating with my friends the moment 117 made it into minecraft education edition we waited about a year for the nether update but instead got both at once
U368lNrisZI,the deny and allow blocks aswell as the border block also exist in the bedrock edition
U368lNrisZI,man imagine being taught with minecraft and even education edition is so cool that would be awesome
U368lNrisZI,ive just discovered your channel and realised the quality you make those are very intresting but wow keep the good work
U368lNrisZI,this is a fun part of the bedrock education edition
U368lNrisZI,i honestly hate how limited ee is accesswise im glad to see modders at least attempting to bring everything to je so the wider community can enjoy it
U368lNrisZI,bedrock having most of the features of education edition and all you need to use them is 1 or 2 clicks depending on if you already have cheats enabled
U368lNrisZI,idk why but i just kinda want java to add features from bedrock edu dungeons legends etc
U368lNrisZI,you can get some of the blocks in bedrock if you turn on experimental edition
U368lNrisZI,thought id point this out
U368lNrisZI,remember that lots of this crazy things can be done on bedrock edition too if you enable them while creating a world
U368lNrisZI,education edition does exist in bedrock under experimental features i believe though some features are not there such as borders
U368lNrisZI,i would love to use all these features on java lol probably a mod out there somewhere but yeah
U368lNrisZI,mojang should add classroom mode as default admin command is very useful for serversrealms
U368lNrisZI,since me and my friends usually cant play regular minecraft we use this its really easy to use and really fun too
U368lNrisZI,out all of those i want the npc and the ability to have them use player skins to for map making
U368lNrisZI,lots of features considering barely anyone plays it or uses it
71XbtkOx7qc,they could have easily made these in transformers by adapting tf kingdoms optimus primal and trex megatron
71XbtkOx7qc,for when an enormous gorilla and a giant radioactive lizard arent enough give em armor and weapons
71XbtkOx7qc,happy to see that these are finally getting a release soon i hope we see these in the united states soon
71XbtkOx7qc,damn that mecha kong looks like something ripped right out of the 90s i need that shit now
71XbtkOx7qc,this titan tech line is awesome
71XbtkOx7qc,this just really really makes me crave titan class transformers x godzillaking kong crossover figures
71XbtkOx7qc,these actually look like a cross between trendmasters power up godzilla figures and the mega mutation figures from the cancelled doom island line
71XbtkOx7qc,that kong with the enhancements reminds me of some duke nukem baddie especially with the shades and com piece
71XbtkOx7qc,honestly when i looked at transformed kong it reminds me of optimus primal if he had a steath force mode
71XbtkOx7qc,one of these days we need a transforming xenomorph
71XbtkOx7qc,the closest thing to mechani kong in the monsterverse
71XbtkOx7qc,they look cool reminds me of the transforming digimon figures
71XbtkOx7qc,omg its the canceled mega godzilla figure shown off back in the 2020 hong kong toy show
71XbtkOx7qc,one step closer to madokagodzillaprime
71XbtkOx7qc,omg my two fave collectable universes collide my shelves did not see that coming preorded
71XbtkOx7qc,hasbro toho collab please i would love if transformers could collab with godzilla imagine all the potential
71XbtkOx7qc,these feel like toys from the 90s lots of weird toys like these were made back then
71XbtkOx7qc,i can really see them doing a retoolredeco of kingdom primal to become a monster verse kong cross over
71XbtkOx7qc,definently got that late showa era style kajiu humor
71XbtkOx7qc,thats so amazing figure godzilla and kong its so cool
71XbtkOx7qc,besides the fact that this is stupid in generalkong looks way better with his cybernetic parts and armorweaponry and yes very optimus primal like
71XbtkOx7qc,i like these figures and they are a great idea but i do t like how they are not in the movie but great review
71XbtkOx7qc,ok who let kenners batman toy designer out  of their cage
71XbtkOx7qc,who in the heck could godzilla possibly be communicating with using that headset
71XbtkOx7qc,theyre really cool and also pretty sturdy
71XbtkOx7qc,even though this is pretty random release it is so cool though
71XbtkOx7qc,i like godzilla and kong can transformers into new form but is big and is amazing
71XbtkOx7qc,godzilla and kong became digimons they evolved into their ultimate level
71XbtkOx7qc,kong with a headset okay now
71XbtkOx7qc,i need a optimus primal that transforms into king kong or donkey kong
71XbtkOx7qc,we knew this day was coming
71XbtkOx7qc,very beast war vibes
71XbtkOx7qc,this movie is way too underrated
71XbtkOx7qc,you sold me on kong with sunglasses might wanna sync it with a biggie song for tik tok
71XbtkOx7qc,did you know the reason he is black is because of the scaring from millions of years of fighting
71XbtkOx7qc,i a definitely getting the godzilla
71XbtkOx7qc,i dont remember these from the movie
71XbtkOx7qc,nice vdeo
71XbtkOx7qc,i imagine the people on the other end of  communicator have the most ridiculous job kong do you see him do you see the target ghraghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh static rasssjghhhhhhhhhhh
71XbtkOx7qc,if they did shin godzilla i would buy it
71XbtkOx7qc,this is gonna be good
71XbtkOx7qc,optimus maximize  lol
71XbtkOx7qc,lol why does kong have a mic does he talk now
71XbtkOx7qc,who is kong talking to with the headset
71XbtkOx7qc,optimus primal and megatron
71XbtkOx7qc,why does he have a headset whos he gonna talk to
71XbtkOx7qc,by primus their socool
71XbtkOx7qc,mechanical monsters cool
71XbtkOx7qc,cool beans
71XbtkOx7qc,transformers shattered glass flamewar and shattered glass wheeljack and shattered glass ultra magnus
71XbtkOx7qc,this cool video mister primevsprime
71XbtkOx7qc,ginseij henkei
71XbtkOx7qc,what the hell are these sponsor bias to a tee
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joyce is a big strong fighter with nice offensive skills but he gets hit way too much
UEQ5qSrrMCY,hes the real life homer simpson from his boxer days
UEQ5qSrrMCY,ive seen more movement at the top of a concrete fence post in the wind than joyces upper body and head movement
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joe will realise he got cracked at some point today everything takes time with him
UEQ5qSrrMCY,big respect to hammer for making a fight of it he got up twice for more at the end there when he couldshould have just stayed down tough fella
UEQ5qSrrMCY,hes not so much a boxer as an unfathomable beast from the black lagoon
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joe joyces style reminds me a lot of george foreman forward pushing heavy handed fighter with a sledgehammer jab with very little head and upper body movement
UEQ5qSrrMCY,nice performance from joyce heavy hitter big heart and a solid chin endured and outlasted his opponent did what was necessary
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joyce is our generations george foreman slow but strong durable and heavy heavy hands
UEQ5qSrrMCY,an unexpected ending a powerful boxer turned out to be
UEQ5qSrrMCY,that flip at the end was sick
UEQ5qSrrMCY,he is a beast would love to see him mix it with the top 5
UEQ5qSrrMCY,love to see him against parker thats a real test joyce needs
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joyce makes me think of a created fighter on fight night champion who has had his health stats maxed out
UEQ5qSrrMCY,i can see joe joyce at the top of his game having 3 amazing fights with usyk they are the 2 heavyweights that will reign supreme after furywilder retire
UEQ5qSrrMCY,fastest he moved was when the fight was over
UEQ5qSrrMCY,imagine having to fight a 20stone heavy bag that punches back and constantly moves forward id quit too
UEQ5qSrrMCY,hes a slow fighter but he is also a very powerful fighter who can take a punch good fight
UEQ5qSrrMCY,dont think ive ever seen a slower puncher legend has it his right hook still hasnt landed yet
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joe joyce is so weirdly watchable how can someone look so bad and be so good
UEQ5qSrrMCY,jj looks so slow hes like a tank love to see him work with fury
UEQ5qSrrMCY,hammers fitness let him down he was boxing very well early and even caught joyce a few times with theoverhand right  credit to joyce chin
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joe joyces cartwheel at the end was the most interesting part of that fight
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joe is like a heavyweight froch granite chin great stamina and decent power slow movement but great timing but hes more likeable than froch
UEQ5qSrrMCY,the peculiar case of joseph joyce
UEQ5qSrrMCY,this was supposed to be a mismatch but joyce showing just how average he is
UEQ5qSrrMCY,go on joyce
UEQ5qSrrMCY,he actually has decent hand speed when he decides to turn on the heat look at
UEQ5qSrrMCY,the usual comments  joes too slow he gets hit too easily yet hes stopped all but one of his opponents including dubois who hit him far harder than hammer did
UEQ5qSrrMCY,loving this new golden era of british heavyweights
UEQ5qSrrMCY,hes so much like george foreman
UEQ5qSrrMCY,would love to see the two joes go at it soon
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joe such a nice man
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joyce reminds me of an old george foreman absorbs punches and just keeps going forward
UEQ5qSrrMCY,well done to joyce but i must say he looks very slow
UEQ5qSrrMCY,imagine if the guys we expect to beat joyce lands their best shots and he still keeps trudging forward
UEQ5qSrrMCY,that guys face at
UEQ5qSrrMCY,hes like a young forman just keeps coming same slow heavy hands and a chin of iron its got to be really demoralising for his opponents
UEQ5qSrrMCY,he reminds me of big george foreman
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joyce seriously needs more precision and accuracy decent boxer imo
UEQ5qSrrMCY,i think joyce is about the only fighter that could take wilders punch id love to see them 2 go at it 
UEQ5qSrrMCY,the most impressive thing was hes pirouette at the end
UEQ5qSrrMCY,takes too many shots against a low quality opponent too easy to hit 
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joe is good at blocking punches
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joyce had a plan and he executed it successfully body shots after body shots hammer laughed it off way too soon
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joe joyce is crazy hes a real juggernaut
UEQ5qSrrMCY,what joyce does is clearly effective but i just wish he moved a bit fasterhed be a dangerous guy if he did
UEQ5qSrrMCY,first joe joyce fight ive watched
UEQ5qSrrMCY,christian hammer is so underrated
UEQ5qSrrMCY,hes so fast the frame rate these days cant handle his punches hence the slow motion matrix effect
UEQ5qSrrMCY,the hammer made joe joyce look good
UEQ5qSrrMCY,he needs a transmission oil change
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joyce got the best chin in the heavyweight division
UEQ5qSrrMCY,ive seen joyce really hurt to the body several times yet no one seems to target it
UEQ5qSrrMCY,when i see this guys fight it always lead me to the conclusion that tyson fury is the best
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joyce gotten faster with his hands about time
UEQ5qSrrMCY,a prime luis ortiz vs joyce wouldve been great
UEQ5qSrrMCY,such a journeyman hes fighting where joyce got this guy
UEQ5qSrrMCY,tough tough man joe hes made for joshuas combinations though
UEQ5qSrrMCY,if he took right hands from someone like wilder over the top like that it would be lights out
UEQ5qSrrMCY,he won against a way past prime journeyman boxer and even needed half the roundsthats not rolling over or through thats a disapointment
UEQ5qSrrMCY,for all his failings he really is a juggernaut
UEQ5qSrrMCY,id love him to fight tyso fury he wouldnt go down and he would just keep hitting the fury from everywhere
UEQ5qSrrMCY,hammer was a pretty decent fighter almost 10 years ago
UEQ5qSrrMCY,that overnight hand in first round if any top 5 heavyweight would of knocked him out or had his legs wobbling
UEQ5qSrrMCY,2 types of fighters he will lose against a good big puncher not dubois and a fast mover
UEQ5qSrrMCY,i d love to see andy ruiz fighting joe
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joe joyce is gonna be the poster boy for brain damage in retired boxers
UEQ5qSrrMCY,hes just so immobile
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joyce gets hit too easily he needs to work on his defence
UEQ5qSrrMCY,celebration was the best thing he did that night
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joe beats uysk easily now have a good laugh but just remember i said it here and stand by that statement
UEQ5qSrrMCY,it must be a crushing feeling throwing and landing flush with your best shots and a 19st lump just eats them without flinching and keeps coming forward
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joyce is the ggg of the heavyweight division
UEQ5qSrrMCY,good win joe mate work on your defence or your getting sparked by the top 5
UEQ5qSrrMCY,ive been watching fighters for 20 years and ive never seen anyone throw as slow as joe joyce its like underwater punches
UEQ5qSrrMCY,zhang would be a good opponent for joe
UEQ5qSrrMCY,joe joyce is going to regret using his head for defence when hes older

pAKC4qy9ZkE,60 million  is very good business for everton  i can see so many players for 3035 who could replace him
pAKC4qy9ZkE,conte walks out on teams that dont back him a show of faith from spurs to keep him there
pAKC4qy9ZkE,hes not worth more than 25 million football is gone crazy he scored 53 goals in 150 appearance
pAKC4qy9ZkE,we will miss you richi thanks for everything enjoy spurs
pAKC4qy9ZkE,spurs looking like a force to be reckoned with
pAKC4qy9ZkE,how theyve managed to get 60 million is beyond me what a deal for everton
pAKC4qy9ZkE,another really good signing although similarly to raphina i think 60 mil is too much realistically he is a 35 mil at best sort of level not my money though
pAKC4qy9ZkE,60 mil is a bit expensive
pAKC4qy9ZkE,hes brazilian he helped keep us up thanks a million good luck in your next chapter richy and ps conte wont like you goin down that much sunshine
pAKC4qy9ZkE,he strikes me as a player that you would love if hes playing for your team but hate if he plays for anyone else
pAKC4qy9ZkE,60m for richarlison is daylight robbery by everton smh
pAKC4qy9ZkE,son and riharlison either side of kane he will feed them perfect passes and all 3 are excellent on their weak foot
pAKC4qy9ZkE,dont really rate him but im sure conte knows what hes doing
pAKC4qy9ZkE,g jesus for 40 million pounds from a winning team while richalison costs 60 million pounds from a team that battled regelations i honestly think spurs lost this one
pAKC4qy9ZkE,think its a good move for everyone hes a good player but far too much ego for a player who just fought a relegation battle
pAKC4qy9ZkE,spurs have been bent over here no way hes worth 60 million
pAKC4qy9ZkE,richarlison  a good player with kane and son   thats a lot of goals
pAKC4qy9ZkE,spurs will have one of the best front lines in europe i hope spurs can challenge for the title itll be good for football
pAKC4qy9ZkE,gonna miss you richy always a blue and a legend in my eyes
pAKC4qy9ZkE,seems 1020m too much for my liking but hes a decent player
pAKC4qy9ZkE,come on you spurs
pAKC4qy9ZkE,thats 10 to 15m overpriced for me but spurs are doing decent business for next season
pAKC4qy9ZkE,welcome to spurs richarlison
pAKC4qy9ZkE,i think conte is a fantastic manager but this is a weird signing by him imo 60m i really dont think he is worth half that
pAKC4qy9ZkE,best signing  a step towards campaigning for a space in the top fours
pAKC4qy9ZkE,richie always gave us everything he had and stayed loyal to us good luck richie we will miss you
pAKC4qy9ZkE,we couldnt offer richie european football which he wanted with everton not with our incompetent board  recruitment
pAKC4qy9ZkE,that is amazing business by everton he is a great player but he does stupid things on the field sometimes  60 mil is a premium
pAKC4qy9ZkE,thats good business from everton this goes a long way to correct the water money of the last 4 years they turned their 40 into 60
pAKC4qy9ZkE,what a signing
pAKC4qy9ZkE,excellent now all we need is a couple of good defenders and we actually might win something this season
pAKC4qy9ZkE,good luck for spurs i hope they will win something this season
pAKC4qy9ZkE,this is a class signing and i hope him and kane can form a dangerous duo
pAKC4qy9ZkE,main issues  attitude behave issues on the pitch  cant create big impact with spurs
pAKC4qy9ZkE,wished one of the premier league clubs compiled a front three of
pAKC4qy9ZkE,when in the mood hell play well he has more off days though everton have played a blinder you never know though he may just need a change of scenery
pAKC4qy9ZkE,thank god i was really scared united would sign him
pAKC4qy9ZkE,everton need to replace their key man who covered when dcl wasnt in the best of form
pAKC4qy9ZkE,60 million wow
pAKC4qy9ZkE,united really did make a mistake not going for conte
pAKC4qy9ZkE,spurs show faith in there manager i hope spurs do well in the champions league would be nice to meet them again
pAKC4qy9ZkE,thats a good signing for tottenham
pAKC4qy9ZkE,good signing for depth can cover all 3 attacking positions and most importantly cover for kane
pAKC4qy9ZkE,spurs getting a very great player
pAKC4qy9ZkE,yes  amazing signing finally
pAKC4qy9ZkE,aware of his hatred towards liverpool but hes good its an exciting one
pAKC4qy9ZkE,oh god  lets just hope he vastly improves then
pAKC4qy9ZkE,and they rejected 85 off barcelona a year or 2 ago good business by everton that is
pAKC4qy9ZkE,in my opinion i think this is a weird signing i dont think its gonna pay off
pAKC4qy9ZkE,this season is going to be massive
pAKC4qy9ZkE,good signing for tottenham from a arsenal fan
pAKC4qy9ZkE,im not sure hes worth 60 but good for tottenham for beefing up their front line
pAKC4qy9ZkE,sooooare we going to hear criticism of how much spurs are spending or are we going to recognize that it takes investment to break the status quo
pAKC4qy9ZkE,everton got an insane deal here just hope they dont spunk it on another waste of space
pAKC4qy9ZkE,60 million pound for a back up striker what a shocking purchase
pAKC4qy9ZkE,60million for richarlison lol thats bloody robbery when nkukus release clause is just about the same figure and city got haaland for way less than that
pAKC4qy9ZkE,mental money hopelessly over priced
pAKC4qy9ZkE,lenglet to be our 5th signing spence to be our 6th signing were gonna be even better next season top 3 easily
pAKC4qy9ZkE,dont see how richarlison fits into the spurs team i think hes for the bench but thats a big signing for the bench
pAKC4qy9ZkE,decent player will do better in a spurs team than one battling relegation
pAKC4qy9ZkE,60m spurs got finessed omg
pAKC4qy9ZkE,hell fit in well at spurs with all the time he spends on the floor
pAKC4qy9ZkE,hes bang average great business from everton there
pAKC4qy9ZkE,great move good player
pAKC4qy9ZkE,never thought id say this but levy really is splashing out
pAKC4qy9ZkE,thought richarldson was going 2 liverpool
pAKC4qy9ZkE,everton laughing to the bank spurs paid 60 million for a tap in merchant
pAKC4qy9ZkE,whats funny is that 2 seasons ago barcelona offered 85m for him and everton turned it down
pAKC4qy9ZkE,he will fit conte
pAKC4qy9ZkE,according to evertons account the fee is actually 360m
pAKC4qy9ZkE,richarlison will improve  spurs playing alongside kane son perisic and kulusevski will force him to watch learn and improve mark my words
pAKC4qy9ZkE,not 60 million but a good squad player nonetheless
pAKC4qy9ZkE,everton doing good business i dont get it
pAKC4qy9ZkE,spurs have been done there 35m tops moody inconsistent and irrational well played neverton
pAKC4qy9ZkE,sure richarlison has magic moments but is he really worth 60m i feel like everton are rubbing their hands with joy at this one
pAKC4qy9ZkE,happy to eat my words but never been hugely impressed by him probably a lot to do with his attitude
pAKC4qy9ZkE,how are teams going to deal with sonricharlisonkulu there is so much pace and quality there
pAKC4qy9ZkE,im expecting a here we go already
pAKC4qy9ZkE,if tottenham kept kulusevski would you play him over richarlison
pAKC4qy9ZkE,i guess everton did need to get a massive sale done by the end of today after all lmao
pAKC4qy9ZkE,in don conte we trust
pAKC4qy9ZkE,very odd signing  anyway hope he get back to his best at spurs
pAKC4qy9ZkE,honestly i would be impressed but i know spurs as an arsenal fan they always spurs it no matter what
pAKC4qy9ZkE,who knows he is pretty good player by the end of the season maybe richarlison scores 30 goals by then everyone agrees hes worth it

HHYSbXknJno,damn what an impressive group of young talent the lakers will never use
HHYSbXknJno,no way scottie went undrafted he was easily the best true pg in this draft
HHYSbXknJno,spj is gonna be special undrafted gem max christie is looking like a great defender in the making
HHYSbXknJno,im interested in seeing swider and spj in a regular season rotation coming off the bench they compliment the current line up
HHYSbXknJno,mcclungs agility and athleticism is really something that lakers should consider
HHYSbXknJno,this is the lakers team we shoudve seen last season very talented and healthy and not old ass players who get injured and shoot bricks
HHYSbXknJno,huff  athletic and can spread the floor
HHYSbXknJno,pippen is already a very good passer not a lakers fan but i like his game  his pops taught him well
HHYSbXknJno,mcclung deserves to get some minutes in the actual team next season and i really liked scottie pippen jrs passing
HHYSbXknJno,lots of great potential here but scottie pippen jrs talent is pretty outstanding at this point  hes a natural
HHYSbXknJno,swider pip and mcclung have been fantastic so far
HHYSbXknJno,we just need to develop these young guysi see some future stars out there we wont have any draft picks in the future so work with what we have
HHYSbXknJno,pippen jr has a lot of promise to be a quality wing at this level
HHYSbXknJno,pippen jr is an issue dont know how he didnt get drafted but thank you  and swider huff  mcclung need to be on the roster next season
HHYSbXknJno,i am really impressed with the lakers youngsters
HHYSbXknJno,scottie pippen jrs passing was so satisfying to watch
HHYSbXknJno,spj with legit basketball dna cole swider kinda reminds me of klay thompson though that catch and shoot is quick and lethal
HHYSbXknJno,i aint getting fooled until i see them play in the leage cuz i remember how high everyone was on svi when he started hitting 3s in summer league
HHYSbXknJno,sleeva looks really nice for the warriors hopefully they can pick him up
HHYSbXknJno,its hilarious to me how scotty jr and cole swider got undrafted and straight up hoopin bruhhhh lakers got young gems out there
HHYSbXknJno,the standouts so far that i see can help the lakers in the coming season is pippen jr swider and christie got good fundamentals
HHYSbXknJno,get pip jr and swider into the main team theyre unearthed gems
HHYSbXknJno,gui santos tem muito potencial
HHYSbXknJno,i think its very important that the lakers pick up an athletic big thats why i say huff is the most important pickup for the summer protect the paint
HHYSbXknJno,all player only one pass what an individual game
HHYSbXknJno,i like the lakers young players lets go lakers
HHYSbXknJno,lakers upper management like woah scottie pippen jr max christie are good players we might be able to trade them for a star in a year
HHYSbXknJno,spj and swider having that summer league zo and kuz vibe
HHYSbXknJno,im glad to see my young laker stars beat the young warriors stars
HHYSbXknJno,cole swider will earn some playing time on the lakers this season if he keeps shooting like that could be a hidden gem
HHYSbXknJno,scottie pj is the steal of this draft
HHYSbXknJno,lakers vs miami heat 100 points lakers vs warrior 100 points
HHYSbXknJno,spj swider and christie is phenomenal it will be great to see them in roster lakers
HHYSbXknJno,this la team is

HHYSbXknJno,lets go quinez
HHYSbXknJno,lakers got some real players on this roster
HHYSbXknJno,pippen got that zo vibes with his flashy passes
HHYSbXknJno,lakers 20 in summer league let go la
HHYSbXknJno,lakers should trade there whole roster for this one
HHYSbXknJno,im a fan of scottie pippen jr
HHYSbXknJno,watching this warrior gleague team play was yet another reminder that golden states system under steve kerr is the only brand of basketball i can stomach
HHYSbXknJno,lets go ring 5 6
HHYSbXknJno,spj is quick shifty and aggressive  hell be ok  max looks a bit timid and slow of foot  maybe its draft expectation jitters
HHYSbXknJno,10066 last night and now 10077 wow
HHYSbXknJno,the lakers future is bright
HHYSbXknJno,just give swider a roster spot bruh
HHYSbXknJno,scottie went undrafted
HHYSbXknJno,i just want the best for mac mcclung keep balling bro
HHYSbXknJno,classic golden state
HHYSbXknJno,ive seen enough ive watched exactly 20 seconds of highlights of this pointless summer league game and im already convinced that the lakers are going 820
HHYSbXknJno,man they should let shareef o play more minute hes the gold mine in this
HHYSbXknJno,crazy how good these are and almost all either wont have a huge role on nba teams or will never make the squad period
HHYSbXknJno,pippen jr is ready solid all around player
HHYSbXknJno,the testing the waters getting the first punch jab and uppercut
HHYSbXknJno,i said it before and im going to say it again lakers nation
HHYSbXknJno,swider pippen jr bass and huff should make the lakers roster bring in some much needed youth and agility they make smart plays too
HHYSbXknJno,swider and pippen jr have been super impressive
HHYSbXknJno,scottie son of scottie pippen but his playing style is like jason kidd
HHYSbXknJno,swider is a damn marksman
HHYSbXknJno,pippin looking like he has what it takes a couple other guys here can make an nba roster toolakers grab the kid who was hitting all those 3s please
HHYSbXknJno,the average 1on1 scoring ability of players these days is skyrocketing  wonder what the new meta will be this season
HHYSbXknJno,scotty pippen jr gives me john stockton vibes
HHYSbXknJno,swider gone make a roster with his shooting ability
HHYSbXknJno,summer league is where everyones a slasher
HHYSbXknJno,na scotty pippin jr and mac mcclung are nice they need to get some time this season
HHYSbXknJno,summer league team better than the actual lakers team
HHYSbXknJno,is the 100 mark a sign of good luck cuz there have been a team before that reached 100 i believe it was kings vs warriors in summer league
HHYSbXknJno,spj is a damn good pg
HHYSbXknJno,swider got hall of fame sniper equipped already
HHYSbXknJno,swider was a great shooter for the la
HHYSbXknJno,someone give that man swider a contract
HHYSbXknJno,tyus jones 20 vibes from scottie pip jr
HHYSbXknJno,at least we know lakers g league team gone win their championship
OZl7wKNz1U0,the opposite idea would be cool too like 10 games that make gaming company wealthy great video as always 
OZl7wKNz1U0,kingdoms of amalur was actually such a good game hugely disappointed that we will never see a sequel because the developers were stupid beyond belief
OZl7wKNz1U0,the bulk of the cost for apb came from the ingame customization system which they had to license the tech from other big studios
OZl7wKNz1U0,wow its crazy to think that one game can ruin an entire game company
OZl7wKNz1U0,i actually really enjoyed too human at the time ill always be hoping for a sequal or remake lol
OZl7wKNz1U0,too human made me so sad the whole dlc tab never had a single option and the game and idea was so good even today i still love that game
OZl7wKNz1U0,i remember enjoying too human it was a different style of game but i thought that it was good and the story wasnt bad
OZl7wKNz1U0,turok evolution is such a coolweird game i loved it so much its nice to see it mentioned even if its not for a great reason
OZl7wKNz1U0,even back when i was more politically ignorant the thought of using taxpayer dollars to pay for video game development was massively stupid to me
OZl7wKNz1U0,kingdom of amalur is one of my all time favorite games i hope the remaster sold enough to earn a sequel
OZl7wKNz1U0,amalur 2012 release is one of the most well optimised games ive ever played never seen such a pretty game run so well on such low level hardware
OZl7wKNz1U0,i loved too human was supposed to be part of a trilogy after they couldnt finish it on time of course
OZl7wKNz1U0,i absolutely loved kingdoms on amalur when it launched all those years ago shortly around the time of skyrim and i found myself playing koa more
OZl7wKNz1U0,gotta love seeing this crew succeeding thanks for all the videos
OZl7wKNz1U0,crackdown was a blast to play the follow up was incredibly disappointing
OZl7wKNz1U0,i have a complete different memory of rebellion developments they made some of my favorite psp games from the battlefronts to dead to rights absolute bangers
OZl7wKNz1U0,i remember too human also being in production for 13 years and youd think it was a clean game but it was a ugly nightmare
OZl7wKNz1U0,wow what a trip down memory lane thanks for that
OZl7wKNz1U0,being rooted in big huges mmo explains the mechanics of amalur
OZl7wKNz1U0,when you have an ad campaign like daikatana did you had better be able to bring the hole package
OZl7wKNz1U0,apb had a few things going for them
OZl7wKNz1U0,ah knowing that kingdoms of amular was originally developed as an mmo explains both some of the design choices and the massive cost of development
OZl7wKNz1U0,would love a new timesplitters game the series was great even a remastered collection or something would be nice
OZl7wKNz1U0,the saddest stories are contracted development teams meeting their end the publisher contracted them in the first place theyre the ones that should be held responsible if the game flops
OZl7wKNz1U0,after seeing what eternal darkness looks like id love to see what a remake would look like
OZl7wKNz1U0,i loved xmen destiny the concept of being able to create a mutant while very limited is still very cool i hope someone comes and tries again
OZl7wKNz1U0,the funny thing about haze is that despite being so poorly recieved i used the haze helmet icon as my playstation 3 profile icon because i thought it looked cool
OZl7wKNz1U0,haze was pretty fun around the start of the campaign but it felt extremely repetitive and what you had to to wasnt explained very well in most missions as well
OZl7wKNz1U0,wow i totally forgot about radical heights i remember thinking that game could be interesting when it was first announced
OZl7wKNz1U0,kingdoms of amalur is still one of my favorite rpgs the combat and world was fantastic
OZl7wKNz1U0,i guess these developers might migrate to another company or something similar they might even end up being part of a successful team and release some amazing games who knows
OZl7wKNz1U0,i shed a tear for what radical heights couldve been loved the old game show vibe
OZl7wKNz1U0,westwood studio released what is my favourite game of all time lands of lore 3
OZl7wKNz1U0,i remember seeing tomb raider for the first time on a british gaming tv show that was broadcasted here in south africa im sad that core died
OZl7wKNz1U0,i actually really love bmxxx i found the game hilarious and a ton of fun to play it was just super absurd and i was all about it
OZl7wKNz1U0,imma be honest i loved tomb raider angel of darkness the whole setting just was a different vibe then exploring caves and stuff
OZl7wKNz1U0,i loved apb when it first came out and the quick failure of that game actually was shocking to me
OZl7wKNz1U0,i dont know why but i loved vexx but i definitely know it was extremely flawed
OZl7wKNz1U0,i remember when radical heights came out i got it on steam but never actually played more than one game of it
OZl7wKNz1U0,glad you mentioned nierautomata i remember playing it and instantly putting it as the best game ive ever played
OZl7wKNz1U0,man two of those games are my favorites i wanted the too human trilogy and a sequel to kingdoms
OZl7wKNz1U0,this was a really interesting video well done
OZl7wKNz1U0,some of these games might of just dropped at the wrong place wrong time with the wrong developers
OZl7wKNz1U0,i will never stop mentioning that activision purchased zaxis bmx xxxs developer during development  essentially killing any chance of it being good
OZl7wKNz1U0,apb was one of the coolest games man an absolutely incredible idea and insane customization system
OZl7wKNz1U0,played apb for years the players give it soul and its interesting because the shooting is actually good there was nothing like that experience back then
OZl7wKNz1U0,im still mourning radical heights to this day it was my favourite br by a long way
OZl7wKNz1U0,kingdoms of amalur was my favorite game during the 2010s more than skyrim it gave of fable vibes and i was so hooked at the story
OZl7wKNz1U0,well see if battlefield 2042 makes this list soon i certainly cant see myself buying another game from ea after that bullshit
OZl7wKNz1U0,can you imagine the balls it takes to sue a company when your already stealing their copyrighted material
OZl7wKNz1U0,for the record apb has one of the most detailed customization systems ive ever seen in a game
OZl7wKNz1U0,can already see people saying where cyber punk because bug  bad game company go boom
OZl7wKNz1U0,you forgot to mention factor 5 and lair ya know that one dragon rider game that at first forced you to use terrible sixaxis motion controls

qdiasjyCRqE,given that 80 of atmospheric friction is due to the shape of the rider its about time we started breeding more aerodynamically efficient humans
qdiasjyCRqE,that new scott foil is  it almost makes wish i waited before getting the one bike to rule them all oh well
qdiasjyCRqE,basically what happens if a cervelo s5 rear merges with a venge front
qdiasjyCRqE,if i cut my body in half but still had the same power  now thats the type of aero that could win me a tour  41 years old 
qdiasjyCRqE,oh that new scott foil is sweet
qdiasjyCRqE,if you had of said its a new cervelo id have believed you
qdiasjyCRqE,that cadex bike looks like it would be a lot of fun in crosswinds
qdiasjyCRqE,those splurge of color on the bikes reminds me of the 1990s  bright neon carnival of frames
qdiasjyCRqE,technology is soo sexy and soo overrated we tend to forget we have to pedal the bike
qdiasjyCRqE,the scott foil now looks like the sworks venge
qdiasjyCRqE,i would be embarrassed if i were a pro and had to wear and ride that cannondale kit
qdiasjyCRqE,david throwing some shade at merc
qdiasjyCRqE,i always thought all that marginal gains bs was just a red herring to throw people of the scent that sky implemented the biggest doping scandal since lance
qdiasjyCRqE,would that aluminum foil im talking jessy marcel swamp gases and weather balloons
qdiasjyCRqE,exploiting the last few available watts is like trying to lose those infamous last few pounds of fat
qdiasjyCRqE,sigh disappointing tech has this channel become the next gcn offshoot
kIFZZonCyS0,crush this market in 2022
kIFZZonCyS0,thank  you  for  all  the  videos  your valuable time 
kIFZZonCyS0,makes a very good point on how the bears didnt take the momentum of the gap down
kIFZZonCyS0,we may not see a definite direction until the last week of july with some big nasdaq names report earnings  get your calendar out and make your game plan
kIFZZonCyS0,now recession is guaranteed and earnings are going much lower  which means stocks are going lower too
kIFZZonCyS0,very optimistic point of view lets see what gives by fridays fed meeting
kIFZZonCyS0,rally to 420 based on the fact that i only have 69 left in my account
kIFZZonCyS0,waited all day for this one its getting interesting im looking to grab alot of tesla shares long term just waiting for 500600s
kIFZZonCyS0,it has to move one day
kIFZZonCyS0,do you consider after hours price action especially when the volume is 68 m 650 pm estover 10 of the daily volume
kIFZZonCyS0,why do you have a green candle that should be red for the spy and qqq am i missing something are my graphs wrong
kIFZZonCyS0,youre nothing short of a total clown if you actually think the markets are going to break this bear market anytime soon
kIFZZonCyS0,were not going over 400
-e16DmKH01s,great art david tshirt available in my new merchandise
-e16DmKH01s,i saw an angel inside the marble and i carved until i set him free michelangelo
-e16DmKH01s,i find it astounding that michelangelo sculpted the mary and jesus when he was 24 and even more that he sculpted david at 26
-e16DmKH01s,he is an alchemist he turned marble into flesh and bone i cried when you said this
-e16DmKH01s,i cant believe he did this at 26 what an insane amount of skill i always imagined him working on his sculptures as some aged master whod spent decades practising
-e16DmKH01s,james you are outdoing yourself what a magnificent video more thoroughly explained than anything art history course i took at yale bravo
-e16DmKH01s,its amazing how someone can take a block of marble and turn it into a lifelike statue thats true talent dedication and hard work
-e16DmKH01s,you know david is a masterpiece when leonardo da vinci is jealous of it and want to put it at a less prominent place 
-e16DmKH01s,i saw michelangelos david 3 weeks ago after a few years of dreaming to see him it felt like that was the pinnacle of my existence
-e16DmKH01s,i saw david up close when i went to italy it truly is a magnificent sight the texture the detail the emotion that went into it is truly breathtaking
-e16DmKH01s,i saw david in person twice  the first in 2003 and then again in 2013  got goose bump each time it really is an amazing piece of art work
-e16DmKH01s,to see david in person is overwhelmingthe statue is stunningly beautiful it took my breathe away its hard to describe how it makes you
-e16DmKH01s,i love how da vinci and michelangelo had a rivalry its amazing how such brilliant minds could live at the same time
-e16DmKH01s,he was so ahead of his time he created david as if he used a reference from the internet x3
-e16DmKH01s,i have an art degree and thought i knew all about this statue  but this is the very first time ive seen davids face and expression  many many thanks
-e16DmKH01s,im not enthusiastic about art usually but this was quite fascinating
-e16DmKH01s,beautifully explained this channel has a very bright future ahead of it
-e16DmKH01s,i can hardly imagine how inspiring it must have been to witness the unveiling of this piece
-e16DmKH01s,this is exactly what i was looking for itll be a great compliment to my studies on literature thank you so very much
-e16DmKH01s,you mention it as best sculpture ever made i would surely say it is actually the best artwork ever made
-e16DmKH01s,started watching casually and ended up with goosebumps all over this video itself is a masterpiece being narrated by an angel
-e16DmKH01s,you made michelangelo sound like a god and i couldnt be happier
-e16DmKH01s,ive always been fascinated by european art thanks for these awesome videos cant believe all this knowledge is free
-e16DmKH01s,james payne is an inspirational teacher and his videos get better and better ive never seen such a truly enlightening account of david or of michelangelo himself
-e16DmKH01s,finally i understand why this statue is so famous i never knew the story before
-e16DmKH01s,david is such a memorizing figure you cant describe it just admire it if you actually needed a reason to go to florence its all about its art and architecture
-e16DmKH01s,the fact that he made the david sculpture at 26 years old will never stop to amaze me
-e16DmKH01s,why oh why wasnt art class in school this well done and narrated beautiful
-e16DmKH01s,i have been to florence many times and i am always amazed by his david michelangelo was truly the renaissance man his art is beyond exquisite
-e16DmKH01s,this is just absolutely amazing work i am baffled and astonished such beautiful pieces should be preserved for eternity
-e16DmKH01s,it is hard to explain the awe you experience when you see this in real life incredible life altering art
-e16DmKH01s,thank you so much for making these educational docs ive learned so much a gian lorenzo bernini doc would be so amazing
-e16DmKH01s,i was lucky enough to see this masterpiece in florence needless to say i was totally mesmerized by its beauty
-e16DmKH01s,i saw david years ago walk in  look up  and he takes your breath away so real  like he is going to walk and talk at any moment
-e16DmKH01s,when i saw the david for the first time every hair on my arms stood straight up and i shivered  such magnificence 
-e16DmKH01s,i saw the real statue tears back and i was thrilled by its originality beyong words real artist life out of stone
-e16DmKH01s,davids victory was intellectual
-e16DmKH01s,the devine david indeed ive never considered those amazing details before like the veins the muscle tension the fact he is uncircumcised etc stunningly beautiful sculpture
-e16DmKH01s,your narrative on the video made me finally able to understand the unbelievable treasure of inspiration this statue is  in this age we are definitely david against many odds
-e16DmKH01s,saw david in florence in 2019 i didnt expect it to be so huge
-e16DmKH01s,my favorite artist of all time god has blessed you michelangelo buonarroti thank you for sharing your art no one on earth has not equaled your talent nor skill
-e16DmKH01s,i had the good fortune to see this statue and its famous replica a few years ago and even snuck a touch of the original   they were magnificent beyond words
-e16DmKH01s,man i am seriously deeply moved you cant help but be moved by such a pinacle of human achievement
-e16DmKH01s,pieta david and moses have to be the most beautiful sculptures i have been blessed to see awe inspiring
-e16DmKH01s,its enrapturing to think that a number of treasures of art are stored in galleria uffizi and galleria dellaccademia di firenze with both within about five blocks of each other
-e16DmKH01s,im italian and this beautiful video moved me to tears thank you
-e16DmKH01s,i feel lucky to be alive in a time where such quality content is provided to us at our fingertips we are grateful for all your efforts sir
-e16DmKH01s,when youtube launched i said what an idiotic idea  who on earth wants to watch other peoples crappy home videos
-e16DmKH01s,ive never really had interest in the famous sculptures  and painting until i saw your videos just fascinating
-e16DmKH01s,just a stones throw away amazing  thank you so much for your dedicated work on these series its a real treat to revisit these works time and time again
-e16DmKH01s,well i just discovered another binge worthy channel
-e16DmKH01s,a truly divine masterpiece david by michelangelo and a fascinating explanation of great art by geniuses of the arts
-e16DmKH01s,the way you presented and sheer enthusiasm and love for his art made me cry what beautiful choice of words
-e16DmKH01s,james you are outdoing yourself what a magnificent video more thoroughly explained than anything art history course i took at prison bravo
-e16DmKH01s,the moment
-e16DmKH01s,i am so glad that yourtube recommended your videos such a great channel james thank you i hope you can do videos on art history by art movements
N6kWx_3My8k,the cow fiend when you first find it is terrifying later on its handy to get some quick xp and maybe some materials
N6kWx_3My8k,ill never get why the diablo 2 cows werent called battle cattle
N6kWx_3My8k,in amnesia i found the water monster to be the least scary monster in the game not the most
N6kWx_3My8k,i really like the idea of that vengeful beast on the witcher i think there should be more consequential bosses to keep you honest for at least half the game
N6kWx_3My8k,bloodbournes chalice dungeons are rough but a lot of fun didnt know that mole was that rare
N6kWx_3My8k,i cant believe you missed john romeros head in doom 2 which is hidden behind the icon of sins face and functions as the icons hitbox
N6kWx_3My8k,i always thought that invisible enemy in amnesia dark descent was a humanoid creature didnt made it any less scary now i know what it looks like
N6kWx_3My8k,the hiss vending machines creeped me out so hard when i first encountered one
N6kWx_3My8k,heres a bonus one red iridium bats in stardew valley
N6kWx_3My8k,10 hidden video game enemies you werent supposed to see
N6kWx_3My8k,coming across a chalice mole while dungeon diving kind of feels like finding the worlds most fuckedup unicorn youre at once amazed and disgusted by its presence
N6kWx_3My8k,the secret cow level was staple for diablo 2 and really helped bridge the gap when going from nightmare to hell one of the best places for runes
N6kWx_3My8k,cow fiend came out of nowhere for me it was terrifying but since it was later in the game it was manageable
N6kWx_3My8k,that pt was the most scariest game ive ever played well done if they made it into a game i wouldve bought it straight out the back it was perfect
N6kWx_3My8k,an additional to the bloodborne entry
N6kWx_3My8k,a good one was in silent hill 2 when the evil dog was in that control room causing mischief
N6kWx_3My8k,10 hidden enemies
N6kWx_3My8k,i had no idea that the mario easter egg was rare i found it pretty easily multiple times i guess its more of a reward for exploring
N6kWx_3My8k,honorable mentions john romeros severed head in doom ii stockholm the megaton gate guard in fallout 3 ron the narrator in fallout new vegas the menderbug in hollow knight
N6kWx_3My8k,honorable mention the reaper in skyrim you have to walk around soul cairn wich is a huge place and find some fragments of gems
N6kWx_3My8k,i tried to get that hidden enemy in the witcher 3 so i killed some and it never appeared  apparently i did it wrong
N6kWx_3My8k,an invincible guy in a cheap halloween costume following you wherever you go is probably a horror story someone has already written
N6kWx_3My8k,there is a trophy for the altered vending machines so we were clearly meant to see them
N6kWx_3My8k,destiny 1 had quite a few bosses secret rooms one i specifically recall is the hive knight in the cabal ship on the dreadnaught
N6kWx_3My8k,devs no you cant cheat stop it
N6kWx_3My8k,love seeing more josh on the channel criminally underrated creator
N6kWx_3My8k,i found the dying light goombas on accident on the edge of the map under the water you can glitch out pretty easy
N6kWx_3My8k,theres also the drm scorpion enemy from serious sam 4 its invulnerable and only appears in cracked copies of the game
N6kWx_3My8k,i loved all the halo 13 glitches and easter eggs as a kid it ment so much to do it the first time
N6kWx_3My8k,i remember finding the search and ghost man easter egg and i spent like 3 hours trying to figure out what they mean
N6kWx_3My8k,i didnt know the labyrinth mole was anything special i think i found him on my second run
N6kWx_3My8k,totally amazing video josh from what culture gamingawesome job
N6kWx_3My8k,funny enough i accidentally found the dying light one by accident when i finished the game i combed the map for easter eggs and found that one
N6kWx_3My8k,lost was such an amazing show and im so glad that people still remember it
N6kWx_3My8k,cow level wasnt much of a secret when they talked about it so much the items and the chat channel it was not a surprise
N6kWx_3My8k,i feel obligated to throw out the killer bunny from divinity 2 the dragon knight  saga that thing ambushed me and murdered me the first time
N6kWx_3My8k,concerning chalice dungeons you forgot to mention the leftovers of that cut boss
N6kWx_3My8k,here is a secret hidden enemy which can sometimes be very easy to see a perfect sentry placement tf2
N6kWx_3My8k,i cant believe with my main weapon being the rocket launcher that i didnt manage to set off a single vending machine in control lol
N6kWx_3My8k,i once was playing wild hunt an fell thru a mountain and ended up in a enclosed area with water against the wild hunt no idea how i got there
N6kWx_3My8k,shout out to the greatest hidden levelenemies of all time the star level from super mario bro
N6kWx_3My8k,im still bummed about pt that demo was awesome and i wish i still had it
N6kWx_3My8k,i mean you can get the boon of spoon in dai perhaps that was the only way to kill the lord of pies p
N6kWx_3My8k,if the game allows you to do something without using mods cheat codes trainer save editor or cheat engine then its not cheating imo
N6kWx_3My8k,i found the one from dragon age inquisition on accident  a few years ago and forgot about it so when i saw it was on here  i was shocked
N6kWx_3My8k,swear ive seen the bloodborne enemy i never thought it was rare or secret though just a regular chalice enemy
N6kWx_3My8k,i honestly think this title is reaching a bit with the whole you werent suppose to see bit lets see
DFjkHnZCqmU,love this  also can we get a fails video or tester video for some recipes i think it would be super relatable and could be funny
DFjkHnZCqmU,those wings
DFjkHnZCqmU,omg that glorious food
DFjkHnZCqmU,can you do a segment where you bring back foods that have been discontinued like paneras original brownie or pizza huts chocolate dunkers
DFjkHnZCqmU,i just saw you on live with kelly and ryan this morning  loved it unapologetically
DFjkHnZCqmU,looks real good boss man
DFjkHnZCqmU,im going to make those garlic knots but use my sourdough starter instead of the instant yeast
DFjkHnZCqmU,papi josh you should add some grilled corn into the guacamole taste so good
DFjkHnZCqmU,is strawberry jam a usual addition to a cheese board in the usa in australia wed have quince paste or maybe fig jam at least in my experience
DFjkHnZCqmU,super bowl is my favorite time of the year not only for the programming and ads but for the fabulous snacks  yum yum  amazon car hop trays
DFjkHnZCqmU,take the 50 yard line straight to your mouth i love that you can tell josh really knows football
DFjkHnZCqmU,no one talks about the amount of dishes and kitchenware that need to be washed after this
DFjkHnZCqmU,yes more of the crew enjoying the food 1010
DFjkHnZCqmU,gosh i wish josh was my friend so i could eat his food

JR3z8lq2cNM,i still wear dresses that i bought 20 years ago whats wrong with a well built good quality simple black dress
JR3z8lq2cNM,me in 2022 wearing the same jeans i bought in 2013
JR3z8lq2cNM,there is still a stigma with outfit repeating even though its something we all do offline the fact the term outfit repeating even exists is repulsive
JR3z8lq2cNM,it sounds ironic when rich people are buying fast fashion clothes then shaming the poor when they cant keep up with the latest trends

h4p6poKQDS8,as an arsenal fan im very happy we will be signing him in the future
h4p6poKQDS8,well done chelsea great signing and i hope he gets the playing time he deserves
h4p6poKQDS8,honestly im not even a chelsea fan but im so tired of chelsea are intrsted in so im really pleased that theyre finally making moves
h4p6poKQDS8,well done raheem youve achieved a lot in your careerkeep going boy we behind yougood luck as you start the new jenny
h4p6poKQDS8,fantastic news as a chelsea fan and hopefully now the board can now start buying some new players that can join the rest of team
h4p6poKQDS8,good signing can see him playing his best football in his hometown of london from a liverpool fan
h4p6poKQDS8,perfect player for the perfect time for chelsea sterling at 27 is entering his prime welcome
h4p6poKQDS8,sterling is undoubtedly a fantastic player but he is no messi and everyone else is on rotation in peps team especially wingers
h4p6poKQDS8,one of the most underrated players in the epl
h4p6poKQDS8,this will be a fantastic signing sterling will cause other teams problems
h4p6poKQDS8,this could be a great signing
h4p6poKQDS8,sad to see him leave if he do love watching him at city
h4p6poKQDS8,great additionstill in his primewelcome to chelsea
h4p6poKQDS8,great movement and positioning if he can keep working on finishing he would be a great
h4p6poKQDS8,congratulations raheemyou be the main boss at chelsea
h4p6poKQDS8,chelsea are getting a top playerhell get more game time  chelseawish him nothing but the best 
h4p6poKQDS8,i started supporting city one day last week sterling will be missed
h4p6poKQDS8,good luck sterling to you new club thank you for everything
h4p6poKQDS8,that is a great signing for chelsea
h4p6poKQDS8,happy to see us getting a striker but tbh im more worried about the defence
h4p6poKQDS8,finally sterling performance ahead
h4p6poKQDS8,sterling has been great for man city no doubt about that and sometimes the critics are unnecessaryim buzzing for him to be unveiled as a blue
h4p6poKQDS8,hes a runner thats for sure but his pass an shot are hit an miss good luck rs
h4p6poKQDS8,big loss for city oh yes he was crucial to all their success in europe he definitely doesnt miss about 10 open goals a season
h4p6poKQDS8,i cant lie this season would be quite interesting
h4p6poKQDS8,yes finally hell get more game time
h4p6poKQDS8,liverpool and mancity  i hope this club knew what they are doing on this year transfer window i hope it wont back fire them
h4p6poKQDS8,good news for us chelsea we move
h4p6poKQDS8,this is such a good signing well have a decisive upper hand on that left
h4p6poKQDS8,i am shocked at what is manchester city doing now
h4p6poKQDS8,chelsea making big moves especially for having american owners
h4p6poKQDS8,good signing there now
h4p6poKQDS8,great business by city sold two players for around 100 million and bought two new players for around 100 million  you do the maths
h4p6poKQDS8,chelsea should have seriously signed jesus with sterling two quality players
h4p6poKQDS8,good signing for us welcome sterling
h4p6poKQDS8,other than haaland by far the signing of the season for a prem club
h4p6poKQDS8,here we go welcome sterling
h4p6poKQDS8,signing makes sense hes sk much better than all their current wingers
h4p6poKQDS8,how city is able to sell of players with one year left on their contract for 45m is amazing arsenal will struggle to get such deals done
h4p6poKQDS8,thats impressive for the cv of raheem liverpool to man city and now to chelsea
h4p6poKQDS8,sterling to chelsea and gjesus to arsenal are two solid deals for both teams haaland to man city is also
h4p6poKQDS8,chelsea we have a tendency of oversigning players and end up with players who are not motivated and dont play to their full potential
h4p6poKQDS8,hell slot in at centre back just fine
h4p6poKQDS8,chelsea need at least 2 centrebacks and a backup to reece james now
h4p6poKQDS8,first good signing in through the door hopefully to a few more
h4p6poKQDS8,im absolutely buzzing about this welcome raheem
h4p6poKQDS8,i said this weeks and weeks ago once city were interested in kalvin phillips that meant they had their english quota got so off sterling goes
h4p6poKQDS8,city will start stepping up interest in saka now i reckon
h4p6poKQDS8,good move for all involved
h4p6poKQDS8,sterling got bored of his teammates winning all the time so he decided to move to chelsea for more of a challenge
h4p6poKQDS8,this is so awesome cant wait to have that lad in the darker shade of blue
h4p6poKQDS8,raheem the dream
h4p6poKQDS8,great signing but still we need an out and our goal scorer and afew defenders still
h4p6poKQDS8,de jong to utd has gone quiet
h4p6poKQDS8,wow surprising to me as a chelsea fan so this is absoluting great
h4p6poKQDS8,great player
h4p6poKQDS8,city benchwarmers
h4p6poKQDS8,well done to arsenal for signing him in 4 years from now
h4p6poKQDS8,good move
h4p6poKQDS8,this should be good for the world cup hopefully he gets more game time
h4p6poKQDS8,with haaland in front man city dont really need an inside forward maybe another winger for mahrez backup
h4p6poKQDS8,im  a manchester city  fan tbh im  so happy he is leaving he cant finish at all and he wasted so many  moments he so often not passing the ball
h4p6poKQDS8,chelsea need defenders not more strikers but its a great attribute very underrated but we need to strenghen at the back more than anything but great deal done
h4p6poKQDS8,liverpool manchester city and now chelseawow
h4p6poKQDS8,one of the best wingers in the world
h4p6poKQDS8,am so happy welcome our home
h4p6poKQDS8,countless times he missed big moments in massive games not once nor twice probably around 2030
h4p6poKQDS8,liverpool man city and now chelsea wow
h4p6poKQDS8,from light blue to the real blue welcome to the team steeling
h4p6poKQDS8,imagine chelsea last year with ronaldo in it number of chances they created and missed
h4p6poKQDS8,he keeps upgrading
h4p6poKQDS8,hes gone because he knows hes gonna be on the bench this season because of the quality ahead of him that it
h4p6poKQDS8,city are being generous arent they
h4p6poKQDS8,raheem loves chelsea dont take a corner on the right hand side they might be back
h4p6poKQDS8,so he goes from liverpool to man city and now to chelsea biggest snake in football history
h4p6poKQDS8,chelsea bringing firepower and bite to the club sadly they wont be adding cr7
h4p6poKQDS8,chelsea makes a great move by getting a diver to participate in the olympics
h4p6poKQDS8,chelsea could be a threat with this team
h4p6poKQDS8,our front 3 sterling  harvetz  mount
h4p6poKQDS8,not to say that this isnt a good move but the fact that chelsea is signing the players who city doesnt deem good enough sais everything
h4p6poKQDS8,hes going to be involved in more than 40 goals only involvement

HhM0BYCHL00,i love that you try to have stormi around as much as possible you seem like a wonderful mom
2ehSCWoaOqQ,intel dont even touch our fab machines
2ehSCWoaOqQ,linus its probably costing intel thousands of dollars to have us here
2ehSCWoaOqQ,linus i got rejected by all these manufacturers for a factory tour
2ehSCWoaOqQ,its really crazy how intricate they can make cpus when over 50 of their factory is so foggy
2ehSCWoaOqQ,linus you dont even want to bump these machines
2ehSCWoaOqQ,the frame by frame attention to scrubbing this video of details that needed blurring is most impressive thing to me here props to the editor
2ehSCWoaOqQ,can we appreciate how much editing this must have took freaking crazy
2ehSCWoaOqQ,intel we are taking single atoms precisely out of these wafers
2ehSCWoaOqQ,after watching this i still dont understand how cpus are made and am going to continue to believe that its just magic
2ehSCWoaOqQ,amazing to see inside a chip factory linus was making me nervous waving his hands about all these sensitive machines
2ehSCWoaOqQ,worked a year and a half on the dry etching
2ehSCWoaOqQ,love that linus has reached this kind of level he has real pull now
2ehSCWoaOqQ,i am going to imagine that several percentage of cpus made this day were made slightly more defective than otherwise thanks to a nearby linus wild gesticulations
2ehSCWoaOqQ,this is actually amazing
2ehSCWoaOqQ,linus you cant even touch the machines because theyre so precise
2ehSCWoaOqQ,ill be honest seeing the intricacies and steps involved makes me less upset at the chip prices over the last couple years especially since i bought a 16 core cpu
2ehSCWoaOqQ,i work in an rd fab i see this stuff everyday  come to take for granted how impressive it all really is
2ehSCWoaOqQ,its mind boggling how big just one of these facilities are whats even more mind boggling is that they cant keep up with current global demand
2ehSCWoaOqQ,insane o thats definitely lifegoal as youtuber very nice video man
2ehSCWoaOqQ,thank you intel for letting all of us see how you do it all
2ehSCWoaOqQ,freaking handsome thanks a lot linus a single gold atom has a diameter of almost exactly 333 picometers or 13 of a nanometer actual process is on 6 nanometers
2ehSCWoaOqQ,i like how linus is wildly waving his arms around as he talks about how you cant bump the machines
2ehSCWoaOqQ,linus that would be a long distance for the foup to travel
2ehSCWoaOqQ,this was amazing thank you linus and ltt for keeping at it and amazingly getting this tour filmed  the ltt enterprise will go down in history
2ehSCWoaOqQ,man i am seriously jealous of linus on this one seeing a fab is the holy grail of my engineering curiousity
2ehSCWoaOqQ,back when i still worked at intel we always said this is the farthest humanity has ventured down the tech tree
2ehSCWoaOqQ,it took years for intel to deliberate and finally decide to allow the living dropper inside their factory thats allergic to drops tremors and vibrations
2ehSCWoaOqQ,im happy for you and the whole team if it were my channel i would still play an intel add at the end of this video
2ehSCWoaOqQ,insanely more complex a process than i could have imagined  fascinating
2ehSCWoaOqQ,linus we cant touch anything
2ehSCWoaOqQ,as an engineer working in a fab im extremely surprised that an enterprise like intel would give linus the opportunity to se how things work in their sites
2ehSCWoaOqQ,the amount of secrecy just makes you imagine how hard intel and amd are competing
2ehSCWoaOqQ,wait hold up i9 i7 i5 etc is determined by quality of the chip and how many errors it had i always thought they had different architecture
2ehSCWoaOqQ,intel has a fab as big as 4 football fields with machines each costing around 3040 million dollars
2ehSCWoaOqQ,linus you dont wanna ever bump these machines while they are running
2ehSCWoaOqQ,how did we go from discovering fire to this absolutely mind blowing
2ehSCWoaOqQ,never felt so stressed about an ltt video like watching a multi diagnosed child on a sugar rush in a multi million dollar crystal art showroom
2ehSCWoaOqQ,not to forget intel is also building an fab here in germany i really like the idea to be not addicted to one manufacturer
2ehSCWoaOqQ,this was insanely cool congratulations on your experience
2ehSCWoaOqQ,its funny how intel is considered behind in terms of their process but the factory and future expansion just seems mind boggling in terms of scale and cost
2ehSCWoaOqQ,linus they only build their fabs in particularly stable parts of the world
2ehSCWoaOqQ,i would love to see an amd flex after these intel flexes ngl
2ehSCWoaOqQ,thanks linus and team this help rationalize the prices we pay understanding the cost of production and how specialized it really is
2ehSCWoaOqQ,thank you intel for doing this i always wanted to see this and learn about it i would love to learn more though
2ehSCWoaOqQ,super cool to see and learn about all the different steps in the chip fabrication process awesome video linus and team thanks to yall and intel for putting it together
2ehSCWoaOqQ,you did a great job describing the fab i worked at samsungs for several years and this brought back memory
2ehSCWoaOqQ,im shocked that intel allowed this  go team blue
2ehSCWoaOqQ,its pretty clear your editing team had some serious hoops to go through on this video congrats to the team i certainly appreciate it
2ehSCWoaOqQ,damn thats insane amount of beyond complex work in the last 200 year the knowledge increased so much everything went futuristic so fast d
2ehSCWoaOqQ,for the longest time i wanted to see inside a fab thanks linus  intel
2ehSCWoaOqQ,the amount of small details this factory can form on silicon is outstanding
2ehSCWoaOqQ,thank you linus  intel i work for a wet bench manufacturer this was a nice overview of fab process
2ehSCWoaOqQ,with the amount of blurredout stuff this could have been a podcast
2ehSCWoaOqQ,i worked for hynix for over 5 years i worked in etch  so i loved this video good job
2ehSCWoaOqQ,i could only wonder how long it takes to make one of those machines to then make one of those super small high power chips
2ehSCWoaOqQ,intel dont touch the machines even the slightest tap could destroy a whole production
2ehSCWoaOqQ,props to the editor motion tracking and blurring up to 7 separate objects literally every shot lol and somehow still keeping the video enjoyable and informative
2ehSCWoaOqQ,like a kid in a candy store  loved this video its fascinating to see how it all comes together and linus looks so happy lol
2ehSCWoaOqQ,this is awesome i never imagined it took so much time effort and precision very cool keep it up linus 
2ehSCWoaOqQ,i always marvel at how people manage systems of this unfathomable complexity
2ehSCWoaOqQ,super cool seeing this massive ultra expensive ultra professional futuristic unorganic building and really good explanations and pointing out stuff too
2ehSCWoaOqQ,amazing video and a lot of apreciation to intel for making this possible
2ehSCWoaOqQ,nice one thanks intel for letting us inside 
2ehSCWoaOqQ,omg i can only guess how many times this had to be validated by intel to ensure whatever needed to be blocked out was blocked out this was expensive
2ehSCWoaOqQ,this video just really show us that intel really put linus in high regards or maybe intel just love linus lol
2ehSCWoaOqQ,i remember being toured around the intel factory in leixlip dublin around that time the i7 had just been brought out to market fun exciting times
2ehSCWoaOqQ,man my heart was pumping hard seeing linus walking through the facility waving his arms and almost touching things linus would be the the reason for another chip shortage
9RnQviK3Dso,i would pay 30 at most
9RnQviK3Dso,i was born too early i need to sue my parent right now

Na9_kU3TvVw,the final one being a historical person is definitely a deferent probably harder challenge especially without any clothing descriptions
Na9_kU3TvVw,your snape seems to be saying potter has been crossing lines ever since he came to this school what a sneer it looks amazing
Na9_kU3TvVw,as someone who hasnt read frankenstein but knows that its imagery is heavily twisted by modern culture i was so sure the last one was frankensteins monster
Na9_kU3TvVw,im just going to flick through the layer styles until something makes me happy i feel very encouraged that even professional artists do that
Na9_kU3TvVw,jazzas geralt was so amazing  even during his chicken scratch stage the shapes are so well defined and the features visible i could never
Na9_kU3TvVw,i really want a part 2 although maybe with wings of fire characters there are humans and dragons so you can practice your creativity with different species
Na9_kU3TvVw,if you do this again you should do a character from miss peregrines home for peculiar children the movie messed up the characters quite a bit
Na9_kU3TvVw,we need a part 2 of this
Na9_kU3TvVw,jazza one of the brushes among the special effects brushes were developing is a chain brush
Na9_kU3TvVw,i really wish jazza would do this challenge again but with other artists like drawfee or other youtubers
Na9_kU3TvVw,i cant blame you for getting stuck in that medieval setting i naturally default to the 1700s regency era
Na9_kU3TvVw,make this in a series on your channel its so interesting seeing how you think and visualize the characters more episodes pls
Na9_kU3TvVw,what im wondering is that a leotard doesnt have legs so katniss is actually wearing more of a bodysuit in my opinion
Na9_kU3TvVw,please do more of this series as a book nerd author and art enthusiast  i thoroughly enjoyed this
Na9_kU3TvVw,would love to see this again with some other characters like hermione or daenerys
Na9_kU3TvVw,ever since i saw lavendertownes series i fell in love with this kind of content it would be great if you did more
Na9_kU3TvVw,this was fun trying to also guess alongside you in who the characters would be got them all but abe lincoln too  loved this
Na9_kU3TvVw,should have done one of bram stokers dracula not many people include the white moustache described in the book
Na9_kU3TvVw,i think you should do more videos like this its so interesting to see other peoples perspective on what a character would look like in their heads
Na9_kU3TvVw,funny thing i guessed katniss everdeen right at the beginning when the description was read
Na9_kU3TvVw,please do more of this this was incredibly entertaining to watch
Na9_kU3TvVw,these character design sessions always fill me with an incredible amount of motivation and creativity
Na9_kU3TvVw,you should make this a series there are so many characters that i would love to see your interpretation of
Na9_kU3TvVw,this type of challenge is always so interesting to watch
Na9_kU3TvVw,i love this please do more blind book painting
Na9_kU3TvVw,this makes me want to finally take that leap and get into digital art but im lost of where i should start
Na9_kU3TvVw,yes more of just drawing although the sculpts and whatnot are really cool too i love when you just really show how talented you really are with your drawing skills
Na9_kU3TvVw,i honestly missed the chilled out sessions of jazza just drawing where his heart goes
Na9_kU3TvVw,ooooh this is such a cool idea also annoyingly im paid like 24hrs after prime day but will be picking up the huion pro 16 cant wait
Na9_kU3TvVw,aaah i really loved this video this was so much fun the guessing and seeing what your interpretation would be of the characters please do this again anytime soon
Na9_kU3TvVw,really enjoy the concept was hoping youd consider all of the characters described features so we could see what the character would have actually looked like
Na9_kU3TvVw,this was a lot of fun definitely need more like this
Na9_kU3TvVw,this feels like the good old days watching character design videos haha this is a super cool idea i hope you do it again
Na9_kU3TvVw,this type of content is why i started following jazza more please
Na9_kU3TvVw,a relatively simple idea and straight forward but i really enjoyed this just watching u draw these characters and guessing along was super fun you should do this again
Na9_kU3TvVw,id love to see this as a series jazza part 2 would be epic
Na9_kU3TvVw,man i wish jazza would update his figure drawing tutorials
Na9_kU3TvVw,those brushes look soooo fun
Na9_kU3TvVw,now that was fun would love more of this
Na9_kU3TvVw,you should definitely do a part two to this was really fun trying to guess the characters
Na9_kU3TvVw,was about to say this was copying lavendetowne but i love jazzas spin on it xd
Na9_kU3TvVw,this reminds me of lavendertownes by the book series nice to see your take on these characters
Na9_kU3TvVw,please do another version of this this was so much fun watching you work and guessing alongside you
Na9_kU3TvVw,i love this could totally make a really cool series
Na9_kU3TvVw,i for sure want to see more of this in the future this is a really fun idea
Na9_kU3TvVw,this is one of my favorite videos i love guessing games and being able to guess who you were painting was so much fun also i think you nailed snape
Na9_kU3TvVw,i cant wait to see more these prompts remind me of some of your character design challenges from years ago i loved those
Na9_kU3TvVw,loved seeing a good old fashioned drawing video  hope to see more like this  and this idea for a drawing video was great
Na9_kU3TvVw,i actually think that this is a great concept i would love to see this as a series
Na9_kU3TvVw,this was awesome and i hope to see more i was hoping the final character would be the jazza  avatar
Na9_kU3TvVw,as someone who uses your brushes almost exclusively im really freaking excited to hear theres a new batch in development
Na9_kU3TvVw,always interesting to see the translation from words to visuals love it
Na9_kU3TvVw,i really liked this video didnt know how much i missed such character designs and creations loved it
Na9_kU3TvVw,your character creation sessions are always the best so much fun 3
Na9_kU3TvVw,love this please do more i like you am a huge nerd with an active imagination would love to see your take on the artemis fowl characters
Na9_kU3TvVw,i had just finished the books and movies of the hunger games and was so proud of myself for guessing it  thanks for all the great inspiring content jaza
Na9_kU3TvVw,the last one should have been the crew describing jazza and see how close that one was
Na9_kU3TvVw,do more of these its fun really make it about the guessing its like a game
Na9_kU3TvVw,definitely wanna see another one this is so much fun getting to see you bring the descriptions to life and also guessing along
Na9_kU3TvVw,when i saw the thumbnail i got so excited thinking this was a collab with lavendertowne would love to see on between you two in the future
Na9_kU3TvVw,i loved watching this kind of stuff definitely want to see this type of stuff again great job on all the sketches really cool character designs
Na9_kU3TvVw,am i the only one that finds jazzas colourgrading in the studio to be too flat and cool and weird looking
Na9_kU3TvVw,new cool brushes heck yeah im always down to increase my brush library hopefully theyre csp compatible since i stopped using ps some time ago
Na9_kU3TvVw,this was a lot of fun id definitely watch this kind of videos once a week at least and i pretty rarely watch jazza

1jrEse_70ok,jabari will be fine those shots that he took are gonna go down eventually everything else he did tonight was amazing
1jrEse_70ok,im very excited that jabari got more touches and looked more confident those shots will fall and when they do hell be fine
1jrEse_70ok,both these teams young talent and draft capital over the next 58 years promises very bright futures for the franchises imo
1jrEse_70ok,smith getting good looks beating his man rebounding and playing great defenseonce he settles down he will be a force
1jrEse_70ok,jabari missed a lot in this game shots a little flat and he looks like hes overthinking and hesitating shots will fall soon and defence was incredible still optimistic
1jrEse_70ok,these teams have so much depth cant wait to see them this season
1jrEse_70ok,jalen williams is gonna be a great player you just tell he knows how to play the game
1jrEse_70ok,no one is talking about tari eason casually getting a double double both games
1jrEse_70ok,i love watching the thunder they got a solid team this year
1jrEse_70ok,can these 2 teams just play every other night so much fun to watch
1jrEse_70ok,good close game cant wait until preseason
1jrEse_70ok,rockets gonna get some asses in the seats with this squad happy for our future
1jrEse_70ok,okc got a nice lineup ahead of them with giddey holmgren and williams
1jrEse_70ok,notice the spacing and driving lanes houston has  jalen green is going to love this guy in his lineup
1jrEse_70ok,rockets defense going to be legit this upcoming season
1jrEse_70ok,i dont know why giddey is in summer league he is a top pick last year and had solid rookie season
1jrEse_70ok,thunder are looking good so far
1jrEse_70ok,glad they fought to the end
1jrEse_70ok,man this rockets youth already owning the league
1jrEse_70ok,played better as a team wanna see eason play well one more game and jabari pretty good hope they bring this all season
1jrEse_70ok,this summer league will turn chet into humblest person ever
1jrEse_70ok,giddy just ran dam near full court in 4 secs
1jrEse_70ok,bros both these young teams 
1jrEse_70ok,jabari struggles to get to the rim just like he did in college defense is really good tho
1jrEse_70ok,our defense was the
1jrEse_70ok,again so far magic made the right choice banchero should be no 1 pick no more arguments lets review it after 2 years
1jrEse_70ok,as the number 1 ranked prospect in the world it is exciting to see the potential players that i will be playing with very soon
1jrEse_70ok,in 4 to 5 years if the core stays together will be insane
1jrEse_70ok,i was completely shocked when ol boy shot a midrange it was a highlight of dudes hoisting up threes
1jrEse_70ok,you gotta know the game of basketball to understand jabaris game  how he will be implemented into the rockets lineup next to jalen green  kpj
1jrEse_70ok,giddey to jay w for a dunk will be a regular theme for the season after seeing how well and how often they linked up in that second half
1jrEse_70ok,jay dub is gonna be really good
1jrEse_70ok,the future rivalry in the west
1jrEse_70ok,hm against big athletic guards chet sure is having a hard time getting what he wants in the paint
1jrEse_70ok,josh giddey doesnt need summer league dude is legitjust keep him healthy okc
1jrEse_70ok,was a decent look at the end but jdub has been pretty reliable so far would have given it to him to finish
1jrEse_70ok,cant wait to see sga play alongside chet
1jrEse_70ok,that giddey kid is good
1jrEse_70ok,in this shooters league giddey really needs to improve in that aspect or else hes just gonna be a taller version of rubio
1jrEse_70ok,chet better start getting back on d man dude looks gassed
1jrEse_70ok,im not gon lie this was a good ass game
1jrEse_70ok,the thunder really playing they actual whole roster except sga and dort
1jrEse_70ok,the things chet does that dont show up on the stat sheet are amazing
1jrEse_70ok,jabari really can shoot it tho
1jrEse_70ok,jabaris jumper is sharp
1jrEse_70ok,giddey getting blown by qt galf speed is concerning cause man is he a gifted floor scanner
1jrEse_70ok,good game 
1jrEse_70ok,tari so tough
1jrEse_70ok,okc had a good game
1jrEse_70ok,jabari was taking some tough ass shots all game gotta work on that a little in the nba hes going to have to take even tougher shots
1jrEse_70ok,first pass by giddey was crazyyyy
1jrEse_70ok,trhae is a beast he need more touches
1jrEse_70ok,thunders future lookin bright
1jrEse_70ok,that was a good game
1jrEse_70ok,holmgren is a future defensive player of the year his game is like rudy gobert
1jrEse_70ok,giddey is so smooth with the ball
1jrEse_70ok,smith just gotta get used to the speed of the game he kinda be looking lost out there dont worry young fella you where you belong
1jrEse_70ok,if you think josh giddy is trash you shhhleeep if steve nash was 66 it would be josh giddy in his prime tho
1jrEse_70ok,i dont get why dieng was picked that high in the draft didnt do anything at the nbl even sotto did more at that league
1jrEse_70ok,i dont think people understand how good tyty really is
1jrEse_70ok,jabari eason and tyty in 1 round lol lfg rockets
1jrEse_70ok,the jaylen williams that played is niceeeee
1jrEse_70ok,giddy winning mvp next season
1jrEse_70ok,chet holmgren the goat already  mell duney 616
1jrEse_70ok,we need 2k23 dynamic duo cards chet and giddey
1jrEse_70ok,josh giddey is so nice
1jrEse_70ok,i believe chet can fly one day
1jrEse_70ok,why is no one talking about houston block party we had on more block
1jrEse_70ok,okc starting lineup is probably going to be
1jrEse_70ok,i told yall about that youngin aaron wiggins
1jrEse_70ok,thunder needs okoro and poku here
1jrEse_70ok,josh is so good

YjP7jbtX_ZM,when he launched the beads and called him mean i literally died  sach is literally so sweet
YjP7jbtX_ZM,zhc also did we mention that hands are tied
YjP7jbtX_ZM,so did nobody here preston say
YjP7jbtX_ZM,i love how he said his art is getting so much better
svqCUWgMmEA,maguire was not at his best today he only scored one goal
svqCUWgMmEA,ronaldos first goal reminded me of the 08 version of him
svqCUWgMmEA,im a chelsea fan but even i get baffled how united fans themselves say ronaldo is the problem
svqCUWgMmEA,freds flick sanchos assist ronaldos hattrick what a game
svqCUWgMmEA,ronaldo scoring more league goals in a single game than messi has all season
svqCUWgMmEA,maguire was sensational incredible finishing beating de gea is no joke
svqCUWgMmEA,20 years for me watching football  soccer
svqCUWgMmEA,this guy was in the uefa 2004 team of the year crazy consistency thats 18 years playing at top level
svqCUWgMmEA,he did hit that first shot with some venom
svqCUWgMmEA,this man utd side dont deserve him greatest footballer of alltime if he wins the wc this year its guaranteed
svqCUWgMmEA,37 years old and hes still the best player on the pitch by an absolute mile the man is pure class
svqCUWgMmEA,now theyre saying  bruno is the problem dear lord
svqCUWgMmEA,roy keane should go the old trafford and teach maguire defending personally
svqCUWgMmEA,807 goals for ronaldo 59 hat tricks
svqCUWgMmEA,the guy has nothing to prove and still proves people wrong my goat
svqCUWgMmEA,we have the greatest player and the wost defender at the same time
svqCUWgMmEA,a hattrick in the presence of tom brady  such a legendary moment
svqCUWgMmEA,the greatest of all time for a reason saying this as a city fan
svqCUWgMmEA,hes been underestimated insulted mocked despite his exceptional records
svqCUWgMmEA,as carlo ancelotti once said the only player more dangerous than cristiano is cristiano who didnt score in previous match
svqCUWgMmEA,maguires goal definitely had shades of messi legend in the making
svqCUWgMmEA,bro dont care u are united fan or liverpool fan or any fan man 37 and score hatrick in hardest league in the worldhave to respect this man
svqCUWgMmEA,the greatest goalscorer footballer  and athlete of all time  how could anyone ever doubt hime
svqCUWgMmEA,when you have the goat anything is possible what an unbelievable performance by the one and only cr7
svqCUWgMmEA,i just love his passion and hunger for goals and for wins thats so inspiring
svqCUWgMmEA,ronaldo is the greatest player of our time no doubt  i dont care whatever you all think
svqCUWgMmEA,next match when utd lose to a maguire mistake
svqCUWgMmEA,ronaldo saved man united from their biggest enemy  harry maguire
svqCUWgMmEA,people talking about rinaldos hattrick but we all know maguire stole the show with that amazing finish
svqCUWgMmEA,put it this way i remember ronaldo at utd when i was 7am 26 now n the guy is still smashing it
svqCUWgMmEA,cristiano ronaldothere is no substituteabsolutely brilliant
svqCUWgMmEA,it just gets worse for maguire his confidence must be at an all time low
svqCUWgMmEA,the best player to ever step foot on the field haters keep on crying  greatness never ends
svqCUWgMmEA,dont hear anything about maguire playing poorly i wonder why  just dancing around ronaldo greatness
svqCUWgMmEA,ronaldo was 100 man of the match but lets appreciate sancho
svqCUWgMmEA,we expect that from ronaldo to be exceptional but dont let that steal the spotlight from the real man of the match maguire his goal was sensational
svqCUWgMmEA,fred for me was the standout player after ronaldo did not try stupid stuff like pogba kept doing and kept it simple
svqCUWgMmEA,i cant vent how much i love cristiano this man is a gift from god all football fans must appreciate him regardless of recent form
svqCUWgMmEA,wow just wow theres nothing else to say other than how many times he has carried big teams like that just wow
svqCUWgMmEA,im shocked that this is ronaldos second hattrick for utd i was guessing he had multiple hattricks in his first spell at utd
svqCUWgMmEA,this is why we wanted him back
svqCUWgMmEA,lewandoski  benzema and ronaldo all scoring a hatrick in a single weekentertainment at its peak
svqCUWgMmEA,ragnick doesnt play ronaldo vs city
svqCUWgMmEA,please talk about maguire keane 
svqCUWgMmEA,you never know what youre going to get from this united side but my god ronaldo you were on  tonight
svqCUWgMmEA,ronaldos first goal was destined to the moon what a rocket
svqCUWgMmEA,still the best player in the world
svqCUWgMmEA,hard workfitnessskillpassionlove of the game strengthall part of mr ronaldoa one offneeds to be appreciated even moregoat but without this manman its are averagethe back four woefuland the captain well
svqCUWgMmEA,when he scored the 3rd goal
svqCUWgMmEA,he is just something else he not the player of 200708 but his attitude desire and role model to other players is so important
svqCUWgMmEA,the first ronaldo goal was dangerous
svqCUWgMmEA,born to be a legend inspiration goat siuu master cristiano ronaldo think about the things that his son will do when hes grown up
svqCUWgMmEA,i mean we were talking about how great kane is and comparing him to benzema and lewa when hes not even on 37 year old cr7s level
svqCUWgMmEA,i agree with neville that we didnt play great
svqCUWgMmEA,ronaldo broke united look at that centre half
svqCUWgMmEA,i love maguire the goat his goal was so good and hes such a generous person giving spurs a goal
svqCUWgMmEA,the best clutch player ever the best of the best the goat
svqCUWgMmEA,everything this man touches turns into a goal
svqCUWgMmEA,when roy keane is happy and smiling its really good
svqCUWgMmEA,this is the ronaldo that we all miss but cr7 the goats
svqCUWgMmEA,i personally would give mcguire the mvp for his amazing consistency
svqCUWgMmEA,if roy kean praises you then youve done something really really special
svqCUWgMmEA,strong powerfull deadly finisher world class at his age cristiano
svqCUWgMmEA,smile on garys face tells it all   like its been long since they last had good results
svqCUWgMmEA,what a man thats all ill say class act
svqCUWgMmEA,just mind blown with how ron still does it
svqCUWgMmEA,watching greenwood and other players actively ignore ronaldos runs all season has been astounding
svqCUWgMmEA,viva ronaldo
svqCUWgMmEA,goals were phenomenal as mentioned by roy keane
svqCUWgMmEA,he did it again cr7 greatest of
svqCUWgMmEA,were they watching a different game
svqCUWgMmEA,this is how you send a message to the manager after being left out in the derby
svqCUWgMmEA,cr7s wild and untamed spirit could be seen really after long time just amazing hope and pray he keeps scoring hattrick 
svqCUWgMmEA,cmon a man who understands what it means to play for united
svqCUWgMmEA,maybe roy keane needs to be the next man united managerhe would clear out the players that arent good enough
svqCUWgMmEA,good to see neville smile after a united match its been a while

1o2lih5d2pc,pretty dark how can we assume the police could tell he had no weapon he had shot at them already
1o2lih5d2pc,wow so many dogs in shelters  for that money you could have rescued hundreds that made me sick to my stomach
1o2lih5d2pc,leasing pets should be a 100 illegal for most pet owners its the same as leasing a child
1o2lih5d2pc,lesson number one dont shoot at cops or you wont be able to ever tell your side of the story
1o2lih5d2pc,lesson dont be shooting at the police
1o2lih5d2pc,why in the world do you have a ski mask when its like 2000 degrees outside today
1o2lih5d2pc,i saw the shock wave truck about 20 years ago at an air show in rhode island  it was impressive to watch  condolences to the loved ones
1o2lih5d2pc,anyone but breaking points talking about how the airlines incentivized pilots to retire early so they could pocket their covid relief money
1o2lih5d2pc,protesters demand answers what more answers do they need he had a ski mask on and a gun on the front seat open and shut case johnson
1o2lih5d2pc,i dont know anyone who would lease or finance a pet im poor and my family has never done that with any of our pets
1o2lih5d2pc,my question is should we cooperate with law enforcement or just runaway im so sad that this kind tragedy happened again and again in this great country
1o2lih5d2pc,omg here we go with rights again
1o2lih5d2pc,so many tragedies over this weekend stay safe everyone
1o2lih5d2pc,removal of the wedding ring says a lot  cops training says if one fires all fires cause you dont know where the threat is comming from
1o2lih5d2pc,i am an animal lovertired of reading or hearing about animal neglectabusetorture and so forth
1o2lih5d2pc,now that im aware of the loss of his
1o2lih5d2pc,thank you delta you never fail
1o2lih5d2pc,better to foster a pet  most pet charities give them the first option to adopt if someone else is interested
1o2lih5d2pc,i command the police force to keep us safe thats the only way to stop the emboldened criminals 
1o2lih5d2pc,jeff bezos is making economics professors and other financial professionals around the country cringe with his disinformation
1o2lih5d2pc,what they sposed to do   excuse me sir are you done shooting at us   run along now and be good
1o2lih5d2pc,pet leasing should be illegal in all states
1o2lih5d2pc,maybe he shouldnt have fired on the police
1o2lih5d2pc,what about the lives of the officers  they have the right to protect themselves after being shot at and then
1o2lih5d2pc,if the puppy place closed down why in the world do buttercup and layla have to be returned and to the humane society at that makes no sense
1o2lih5d2pc,im surprised the police even chased this person
1o2lih5d2pc,people do not buy pets rescue pets who need a home from city shelterspounds just say no to being a selfish stupid human being
1o2lih5d2pc,pet leasing why buy when you can adopt a dog of similar size that is kept at a shelter
1o2lih5d2pc,thanks nbc for the news happy 4th of july for your crew
1o2lih5d2pc,the guy shot at the cops cops shot back in response what am i missing
1o2lih5d2pc,pets dogs specifically are commodity slaves in america heavy statement right think about its truth
1o2lih5d2pc,gee i wonder what would have happened if walker had pulled over and complied bet he would still be with us huh
1o2lih5d2pc,he wouldnt have been standing after being hit with a handful of bullets they had to have just been shooting a body on the ground by the end of that
1o2lih5d2pc,here we go again why is that this people always  run away  from police why they are always  in trouble
1o2lih5d2pc,you can see the flash from the gun
1o2lih5d2pc,maybe stop running from the police 
1o2lih5d2pc,the idea is to stop when the police asks you to stop and certainly do not shoot at them then incidents such as this one will not happen
1o2lih5d2pc,even bonnie and clyde could tell you shooting at cops from your car is asking for some trouble
1o2lih5d2pc,thank you for the weekend news
1o2lih5d2pc,you shot at the police while fleeing on a speed chase you get just what you asked for
1o2lih5d2pc,we need police academy back i miss leslie nielsen
1o2lih5d2pc,keep  those updates coming kindhearted  man
1o2lih5d2pc,yeah sad but the moral of this story is dont shoot at cops from your car and expect them to not shoot back heck they tried tasers before bullets
1o2lih5d2pc,in countries without a gun violence plague police never has a need to fire that many rounds to catch anyone
1o2lih5d2pc,if nothing else changes in police justice i think that unloading your weapon on the criminal should be illegal
1o2lih5d2pc,this is a super big stretch come on he shot at them then ran from the car
1o2lih5d2pc,rising prices has made me budgetsmart weve had recessions in the past with republican presidents so whats the difference we need to manage our money
1o2lih5d2pc,thank you for putting this on early and now i can go to bed yeah
1o2lih5d2pc,its too bad a reliable non lethal weapon couldnt be developed so situations like this could be avoided
1o2lih5d2pc,cops fired 20 times before he firedthat changes the nature of the contact
1o2lih5d2pc,thank you kate
1o2lih5d2pc,are we really going to defend this guy after he shot at the police  im all for police reform but this is getting ridiculous
1o2lih5d2pc,dang kate hitting us  with the style again go girl
1o2lih5d2pc,cant wait till policeactivity uploads the full video so we can see the entire story
1o2lih5d2pc,i have a 25 year old son and i cant imaging him high speed running from the police shooting at them then running on foot
1o2lih5d2pc,alex dont feel the same ive seen his interview and hes telling people dont come russia will treat him fairly
1o2lih5d2pc,man she took that dog lease and ran with it common people
1o2lih5d2pc,so there throwing a protest for a dude that literally was shooting a the cops hmmm how smart

st58OXwZIQM,heres a question that no one seems to be thinking about
st58OXwZIQM,was russian defeat in astan a fantasy yes until they gave up
st58OXwZIQM,defense is usually easer than offense hope it goes according to plan  victoria to the warriors of ukraine
st58OXwZIQM,in my life many times there were people who have told me i cant do something each time they were wrong
st58OXwZIQM,i mean considering how often russia moves the goalposts for victory they wont consider themselves defeated either way
st58OXwZIQM,constantly and clearly  purposely dw is skipping the contributions made by poland which in fact is second  after the us of a  military and humanitarian aid supplier
st58OXwZIQM,the moral is to the physical as three is to one  napoleon bonaparte
st58OXwZIQM,quick questions
st58OXwZIQM,rosen is a political science expert why is he answering a military question what expertise does he have in the field
st58OXwZIQM,when the us declared independence from great britain this guy would have said it was a hopeless cause
st58OXwZIQM,the ukrainians will figure it out i know they will they are strong willed and love their country wouldnt we be if somebody invaded the usa come on seriously
st58OXwZIQM,the guest there is laughing when he says something so incredibly selfevident yet seemingly lost on all the decisionmakers russia has everything it needs to prosecute the war indefinitely
st58OXwZIQM,we give ukraine strengthskilland heart
st58OXwZIQM,if russiaputin wants his empire back then what would he do if england wanted thiers back or italy or the vikings
st58OXwZIQM,im  so sorry ukraine im praying for you
st58OXwZIQM,diplomacy war is the direct result of the failures of said conversely when victorious generals receive acts of unconditional surrender is an exercise of truly successful diplomacy
st58OXwZIQM,never underestimate a man defending his home and family
st58OXwZIQM,can you ever sympathize with someone that threatened you with nuclear weapons is that person ever going to be considered a reliable partner isnt that loosing strategically in beforehand
st58OXwZIQM,in 1940 people said the same thing about germany  they where to powerful  to mighty look what happened to them
st58OXwZIQM,you cannot reason with a tiger when your head is in its mouth  winston churchill
st58OXwZIQM,germanys negativity ends its right to lead eu
st58OXwZIQM,dont give up ukrainians keep fighting 
st58OXwZIQM,no point in having lots of ammo if it keeps getting destroyed and you cant replace the barrels of your weapons fast enough
st58OXwZIQM,critics said ukraine would lose within the first month of the war ukraine still lives and the courage and determination of its citizens will be remembered for years to come
st58OXwZIQM,all the honour
st58OXwZIQM,it sounds like as soon as russia turns off germanys gas germany changes its tone
st58OXwZIQM,not half of donbas they completed taking lugansk recently they have control of over half of donetsk including its biggest cities  more like 75 of the donbas perhaps even more
st58OXwZIQM,that lady at the beginning has real spirit slava ukraine
st58OXwZIQM,well if ukraine invaded russia then well have a whole different problem
st58OXwZIQM,i think in the south region its very possible the ukraine army is close to cherson in the east it could be a long and a hard fight
st58OXwZIQM,gotta love these analysts saying ukrainians stand no chance
st58OXwZIQM,this guys a pundit and not a very honest one hes giving his opinions as facts
st58OXwZIQM,these old men assume they know alot everyone assumed ukraine would fall in a days bigger doesnt always mean better
st58OXwZIQM,i hope so good job ukraine
st58OXwZIQM,good luck ukraine  our prayers are with you 
st58OXwZIQM,i concur with the woman speaking at
st58OXwZIQM,they won by surviving however they may never get donbas back
st58OXwZIQM,compromise is something both sides hate
st58OXwZIQM,and i do support for ukraine and i forgot to say courage which means brave
st58OXwZIQM,i also think hes not taking into account the russian military are not well trained into his calculation numbers itself are not enough
st58OXwZIQM,we may surmise the situation but it is ukraine who must decide and we must help
st58OXwZIQM,good interview very candid great questions and very wellconceived responses
st58OXwZIQM,never give up nuclear weapons is going to be the lesson learned for other countries
st58OXwZIQM,nice joke after losing almost 200k troops
st58OXwZIQM,slava ukraini
st58OXwZIQM,the russian military has been exposed as incompetent war criminals i support arming ukraine as much as needed
st58OXwZIQM,the fact that they are bigger country does not mean that everyone there is willing to die for the sake of corrupted mafia in the government to stay in power
st58OXwZIQM,to any sane person and thinking rooted in reality it is obvious that russia will win and ukraine and the west will lose in a resounding defeat
st58OXwZIQM,if ukraine is preparing a counterattack why are they telling the media about it if the media knows about it certainly russia does too
st58OXwZIQM,the war is being turned to favor the ukrainians the progress russia made is just a 2 gain and took 15k dead and 3x that wounded and tons of equipment
st58OXwZIQM,afghanistan beat russia in the 19791989 invasions it was because russian went broke  trying to occupy afghanistan not through military victories
st58OXwZIQM,just like eighty years ago russia will liberate all of its land  including the remaining ukrainian territory lithuania latvia and estonia  from the invading western hordes
st58OXwZIQM,when the ussr defeated the german army in ww2 the ukrainians faught even harder than the russians they defeated germany thanks to the ukrainians
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,wow this is fascinating
UBZ6Bd0LDjs,of course we all need to plan our afterlife

_eaK4DIxB5s,i literally have so much respect for all of these athletes theyre pushing their bodies to the absolute limit for their team its crazy
_eaK4DIxB5s,nice to see other sports
_eaK4DIxB5s,as impressive as volleys are in football including scorpion kicks and bicycle kicks the hardest and beautiest goals are those who come from dribbling past defences
_eaK4DIxB5s,how does braden holtbys fame 2 save against vegas in the 2018 stanley cup finals not make this list  that save literally changed the momentum of the entire series
_eaK4DIxB5s,i stopped watching when i saw marshawn lynch run only at 76
_eaK4DIxB5s,this list cant seem to decide if it values significance or difficulty
_eaK4DIxB5s,97 almost teared me up such commitment
_eaK4DIxB5s,20182019 nba season has got to be one of the all time greatest seasons with dame and kawhis game winners and other amazing highlights
_eaK4DIxB5s,villanovas game winning shot for national championship at 58 is absolutely criminal
_eaK4DIxB5s,marshawn lynch at 76 that is on of the best runs i have ever seen in the nfl
_eaK4DIxB5s,lewandowski scores 5 goals in like 5 minutes
_eaK4DIxB5s,no one has ever been more from toronto than the person who made this video

_eaK4DIxB5s,that curling shot honestly should have been top 15 ive never seen a rock thrown so perfectly i dont curl but that was nuts
_eaK4DIxB5s,dude ray allens shot was epic i was in the caribbean watching a feed from brazil in spanish and heard half the resort scream when he got that shot
_eaK4DIxB5s,anyone asking why kawhis shot was number 1 that shot was the first ever buzzer beater game winner in a game 7 in nba history
_eaK4DIxB5s,feels like a lot of the amazing baseball catches were made during jackie robinson day wearing 42 his legend lives  on
_eaK4DIxB5s,as a multi sport fanatic this was a treat
_eaK4DIxB5s,75 i love it how the golf announcer remains completely nonchalant and is talking about something completely different whilst a huge phenomenal putt is being made
_eaK4DIxB5s,man that end zone catch that stuck like a magnet was hard to believe
_eaK4DIxB5s,no zlatan vs england and no mike trout catch at camden garbage
_eaK4DIxB5s,i still cant believe 94 happened how do you miss that tackle
_eaK4DIxB5s,excluding significance of plays heres a few left out
_eaK4DIxB5s,when i rewound 98 10 times  i knew this would be a good list
_eaK4DIxB5s,me a curling highlight really weve got a curling highlight well you can definitely tell its from canada thats for sure
_eaK4DIxB5s,only one kevin pillars superman catch ok i can live with that
_eaK4DIxB5s,como um bom brasileiro s assisti as jogadas de futebol
_eaK4DIxB5s,1hermosa eleccion
_eaK4DIxB5s,not sure if i totally agree with a lot of them but some really amazing plays for sure
_eaK4DIxB5s,this list is missing the jerome simpson bengals front flip touchdown
_eaK4DIxB5s,1ray allen shotaka the greatest shot in nba history
_eaK4DIxB5s,i appreciate the wide range of sports on display here football both us and uk baseball basketball hockey rugby golf cricket tennis and even curling very nice
_eaK4DIxB5s,every sport oh my god thats unbelievable
_eaK4DIxB5s,acertou a cesta de longe  top 91
_eaK4DIxB5s,pedros goal is underrated and should be higher up
_eaK4DIxB5s,they should have made different categories
_eaK4DIxB5s,as figured cant really agree with the order of this list but everything is really impressive nonetheless
_eaK4DIxB5s,diggs had to have gotten a bonus on his check
_eaK4DIxB5s,wheres ooh blocked by james
_eaK4DIxB5s,braden holtbys the save from the stanley cup finals against the golden knights more than deserved to make this list
_eaK4DIxB5s,the karlsson pass to hoffman deserved top 10 imo
_eaK4DIxB5s,felt like 5 minutes this reminds me how amazing sport is
_eaK4DIxB5s,man beastmode has to be wayyyyy higher than 76
_eaK4DIxB5s,top 100 canadian sports plays of the decade
_eaK4DIxB5s,if they were going to have a zlatan play they should have gone for his goal vs england
_eaK4DIxB5s,1 should have been brad marchands legendary shootout attempt
_eaK4DIxB5s,wow if beast mode and hail diggs are only in the 70s im looking forward to the rest
_eaK4DIxB5s,nr 54 is officialy the nr 1 thats the best sport play i have ever seen in my life
_eaK4DIxB5s,minneapolis miracle at 94
_eaK4DIxB5s,that was the hypest curling play ive seen ever
_eaK4DIxB5s,the fact that the jacksonville jaguars has made the list has personally made me question reality
_eaK4DIxB5s,so youre telling me that zlatan ibrahimovics bicycle kick against england wasnt a top 100 moment thia decade
_eaK4DIxB5s,best hockey plays of the decade with a side of baseball football basketball and a hint of european sports
_eaK4DIxB5s,theres no way theres that many hockey plays in the top 10
_eaK4DIxB5s,yeah whoever made this video is 1000000 from canada
_eaK4DIxB5s,lets all just ignore the kid he crushed in that dive
_eaK4DIxB5s,alternate titletop 100 plays in the history of sports in canada
_eaK4DIxB5s,should have been 5 or 10 more messi goals in there

9r6C0nS0M6U,the scenes with black noir and his cartoon hallucinationsmemories were incredible eight episode seasons of this show is not enough
9r6C0nS0M6U,this might just be the best season of the boys so far
9r6C0nS0M6U,antony is a class actor who can say a whole story with just his face
9r6C0nS0M6U,jensen ackles played this role so well he was so scary this episode
9r6C0nS0M6U,what a fantastic season of television for the first time in a long time i have no idea whats coming i missed this feeling
9r6C0nS0M6U,this season is imo the best of the boys so far and has only gotten better and better which each episode cant wait to see how they wrap things up
9r6C0nS0M6U,the glasses thing really works we should have never doubt klark kents signature disguise
9r6C0nS0M6U,this is probably the most emotional episode of this series between butcher noir and kimiko and frenchie i almost shed more than a few tears
9r6C0nS0M6U,i really wish we could hear maeves actress talk about homelander trying to harvest her eggs
9r6C0nS0M6U,even when it seems impossible this show keeps getting better and better
9r6C0nS0M6U,i cant believe were down to only one episode left already the wait for this season was so hard and now its almost over already
9r6C0nS0M6U,they took all the best of the comic fixed the worst of it and kept everyone acting true to themselves despite all the changes i love it
9r6C0nS0M6U,jensen needs to be in season 4 to explore homelandersoldier boy dynamic father and son
9r6C0nS0M6U,jensen and antony you guys should be in every movie and tv show ever produced
9r6C0nS0M6U,jack actually talking about what vnn obviously is making fun of have hit some people right in their fwelings 
9r6C0nS0M6U,watched the boys and stranger things back to back low key trippy to see paul reiser in both
9r6C0nS0M6U,im interested to see what sbs motivations are now that he knows homie is his son this bombshell totally reshapes the rest of season 3
9r6C0nS0M6U,i love how jensen delivers his lines
9r6C0nS0M6U,i require more scenes of emotional butcher karl flexing his acting muscles is always good to see
9r6C0nS0M6U,i like antonys performance more and more as the series goes on
9r6C0nS0M6U,la mejor temporada de the boys sin duda esperando con ansias el ltimo episodio
9r6C0nS0M6U,i really love watching these interviews after watching the episode it gives me a  new found respect for everything
9r6C0nS0M6U,if the finale stick the landing this might be my favourite season this show is so well written
9r6C0nS0M6U,i love that you are getting more into the characters heads we get to see more of what the actors can do
9r6C0nS0M6U,kimiko actress is so good no lines but so much emotions
9r6C0nS0M6U,starlight  hughie should have their own sitcom mad about hugh
9r6C0nS0M6U,fridays literally give me a reason to live because of this brilliant show
9r6C0nS0M6U,i truly believe that both karl urban and antony starr should get every acting award possible for this season some of the best ive ever seen
9r6C0nS0M6U,can we ask the actors next time a question about where they would like their characters arch to go in the series
9r6C0nS0M6U,the animation mixed in the show was absolutely aw inspiring and breathtaking i thought it was beautiful
9r6C0nS0M6U,stormfront is alive
9r6C0nS0M6U,i literally had to rewind that part like 2 times wtf moment definitely loved it
9r6C0nS0M6U,always glad to see john noble in anything have loved him since his days on fringe was weird seeing him play someone so mean
9r6C0nS0M6U,i love nathan mitchell so much as well he kills as black noir
9r6C0nS0M6U,i just started watching the boys and im lucky this is the best season
9r6C0nS0M6U,this show is some of the best tv on right now i mean compared to disneys kenobi the boys beats it on every level
9r6C0nS0M6U,this season is so god damn good  jensen is killing it as sb
9r6C0nS0M6U,by far my favorite series ever made
9r6C0nS0M6U,this soldier boy homelander revelation will definitely alter the deal between butcher and soldier boy
9r6C0nS0M6U,best show ever best cast ever best director and scripts ever
9r6C0nS0M6U,this is the best season of the boys so far i thought s1 and s2 were pretty boring compared to the best season 3
9r6C0nS0M6U,what if mave was his daughter because they have simmilar powers and not homelander
9r6C0nS0M6U,really wish they gave soldier boy that war history background wouldve been really cool
9r6C0nS0M6U,cant wait for the finale that fathersolider boy and sonhomie duo is coming
9r6C0nS0M6U,both of them love the spotlight too much i  dont see them giving that up for anybody even if they are related
9r6C0nS0M6U,wow this series love it
9r6C0nS0M6U,omg i want friday to come now i cant wait for the finale im so hyped for it
9r6C0nS0M6U,you can see jesson tried so hard and talk very slowly in the end of the interview haha
9r6C0nS0M6U,this show is like temporary v i cant stop i need more and more
9r6C0nS0M6U,looking at anthony starr in that interview it looks like he could audition for wolverine and nail it
9r6C0nS0M6U,yea just incredible show especially for a superhero film it just fails to miss a beat it worries me for the writer of the source material
9r6C0nS0M6U,if butcher doesnt tell hughie about the danger of continuing to take v24 this could create a permanent rift btwn them 
9r6C0nS0M6U,karl urban in mcu hear me asgardians im helas dipshit the executioner
9r6C0nS0M6U,butchers flashback nightmares were seriously haunting
9r6C0nS0M6U,v seems like a miracle drug tbh in real life bond villains like jeff bezos and putin and all the rich and powerful elites would take it not normies
9r6C0nS0M6U,homelander im just a sads test tube baby
9r6C0nS0M6U,supernatural should have ended after 5 seasons the prime kripke run so i really hope this show ends on the highest of high notes much like breaking bad
9r6C0nS0M6U,i cant imagine tony starr with this look playing homelander the specs did change a lot
9r6C0nS0M6U,antony starr should now debut the mcu with wolverine in the main timeline
9r6C0nS0M6U,i dont think i would ever say this but i feel so bad about noir and what an ass soldier boy was to him
9r6C0nS0M6U,i guessedpredicted that reveal after soldier boy killed mindstorm glad to know i was right
BgPOeuFl2e0,we all must thank celine for these miracles v and lisas interaction is a dream come true for me  park bo gum is such a gentleman l

HdscSv53dGI,feeling so heartbroken over the 21 lives cut short during the uvalde texas elementary school shooting such a nightmare
HdscSv53dGI,those armed officers knew there was a gunman shooting at children no doubt this is cowardice its worst
HdscSv53dGI,1 gun man and all thoes police officers  r u kidding ur telling me they couldnt take him down they out numbered him wow
HdscSv53dGI,isnt it ironic police only take action  when we are unarmed but when an individual is armed they do nothing
HdscSv53dGI,it must really be low standards to become a police officer these days  the girl saying im doing this for you sister got me
HdscSv53dGI,fire each and everyone of those officers watching the video it looks like a bunch of untrained peopleand the guy and hand sanitizer really dude
HdscSv53dGI,they were more concerned about sanitizing their hands than saving those children absolutely disgusting fire them all
HdscSv53dGI,these uvalde officers  should all be fired and arrested
HdscSv53dGI,disgusting just beyond disgusting
HdscSv53dGI,how anyone could sit there and listen to children being murdered for an hour without moving in orders or no is unfathomable to me
HdscSv53dGI,wow police force that attempted to stay safe instead of protecting and serving their community and unarmed children and teachers are pathetic fire all of them
HdscSv53dGI,that whole police department needs to be dismantled and rebuilt from scratch
HdscSv53dGI,the officers had equipment prepared to face a 300 man spartan armymore people couldve been saved just by using common sense and urgencysuch a shame
HdscSv53dGI,authorities are now using the james webb telescope to see if they can locate any trace of dignity and courage in the uvalde police force
HdscSv53dGI,the guy in the hallway putting on hand sanitizer horrible
HdscSv53dGI,the government and law enforcement  needs a drastic overhaul
HdscSv53dGI,i mean ive seen some paranoid people who are obsessive about having to use hand sanitizer but during a mass shooting guy must lead a miserable life
HdscSv53dGI,this made me sick disgusting what these law enforcement failed the people they signed up to protect
HdscSv53dGI,nothing breaks like the heart
HdscSv53dGI,how can this officers go to sleep at night knowing that they could have saved lives
HdscSv53dGI,not a hero amongst them awful
HdscSv53dGI,quite frankly uvalde police looked cowardlyperiod
HdscSv53dGI,border patrol had to come end it thats sad that tells a lot about the police
HdscSv53dGI,those images from the james webb telescope are incredible
HdscSv53dGI,i am mexican and not offended love you dr jill
HdscSv53dGI,that whole police department 1 word description trash
HdscSv53dGI,thanks for being a great news person and presenting the best newscast
HdscSv53dGI,he invited
HdscSv53dGI,this video is so embrassing on so many levels
HdscSv53dGI,great to be here in time
HdscSv53dGI,we are not tacos is so funny to me
HdscSv53dGI,interesting news coverage very informative information
HdscSv53dGI,those cowardly officers should be charged with criminal negligence manslaughter  and those officials and politicians who are hiding evidence must be charged with obstruction of justice
HdscSv53dGI,sue them and fire them all starting at the top
HdscSv53dGI,does any state trooper practice physical training what are the minimum and maximum standards how many water breaks are needed to not help
HdscSv53dGI,wait theyre mad at dr jill for mispronouncing bodegas  
HdscSv53dGI,many parents would have went into that school unarmed and in a heartbeat given the chance
HdscSv53dGI,finally some good news
HdscSv53dGI,i almost threw up watching the officers and the shooter that was very sickening
HdscSv53dGI,i love the shoutout lester made to fellow space nerds right there at the end
HdscSv53dGI,police were armoured and loaded
HdscSv53dGI,the uvalde misfactor should be   included in all law enforcement programmes as how not to behave act and respond by the police
HdscSv53dGI,obviously these cops were pooping
HdscSv53dGI,let me ask if those cops own children was in the classroom would they had act would theyve had more heart those cops are cowards
HdscSv53dGI,lester is one of the last news anchors worth listening too he reports the news not his opinions
HdscSv53dGI,i am mexican and am not offended by ms bidens comments just saying get over it people
HdscSv53dGI,the fatal negligence of the uvalde police response to the massacre should be treated as being an accomplice to the murderer the entire police force should go to jail
HdscSv53dGI,those are some cowardly cops   they should all be fired 
HdscSv53dGI,the uvalde recording was leaked were not supposed to see it to whoever leaked it thanks cowards sat by as they were murdered so angry
HdscSv53dGI,wow if it looks this bad with what they released to us imagine what the unedited video would contain
HdscSv53dGI,republicans the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun
HdscSv53dGI,hand sanitizing your hands and acting casual when gun shots are being fired to small innocent children its the most messed up thing that can happen its insane
HdscSv53dGI,man who doesnt like breakfast tacos
HdscSv53dGI,they retreated like cowards every one of those police officers should be fired
HdscSv53dGI,these officers should be black balled and never employed again in any kind of position of law enforcement in america
HdscSv53dGI,former president trump is a 76 yo man hes not a an impressionable child   nice one republican cheney he acts like a spoiled 6 year old boy though
HdscSv53dGI,those cops will have to live with their cowering ways for the rest of their lives and i dont think thats enough
HdscSv53dGI,look up the definition of treasonhe should have been in cuffs on the 6th
HdscSv53dGI,exposed for the cowards law enforcement truly is officer safety to the extreme
HdscSv53dGI,loved lester shouting out to other space nerds at the end of the broadcast
HdscSv53dGI,police that was running back they all should be fired
HdscSv53dGI,police hiding from a real present and lethal ongoing threat witnessing a villain taking the most inocente not caring enough to worry about cleanliness speaks volumes
HdscSv53dGI,standing there putting hand sanitizer on his hands contemplating how his mother bore such a failure
HdscSv53dGI,there are four or five police officers
HdscSv53dGI,this brings a whole new meaning to blue lives matter their lives were clearly more important than innocent children
HdscSv53dGI,pure cowardice on the police part 
HdscSv53dGI,problem is texas pride for the police the public doesnt question it so they do what they want
HdscSv53dGI,when kids are bleeding out always pause to sanitize your hands
HdscSv53dGI,this is truly how much twitter is worth it has been nothing but bad for this country
54HDLzp-ntQ,the combo of jake lamb and trayce thompson has been exactly what we needed
54HDLzp-ntQ,another lateinning comeback and another gem fron clayton kershaw its a pleasure watching him pitch
54HDLzp-ntQ,kershaws best days are over but his pitching is really good a pitch that shows why hes a legend
54HDLzp-ntQ,great game great day for kershaw great comeback now lets try for the sweep cya go dodgers and finally kimbrel is had a nice inning
54HDLzp-ntQ,the last few dodger games have been incredibly exciting especially for july games dodger baseball is the best
54HDLzp-ntQ,jake lamb seemingly is finding his groove i like it
54HDLzp-ntQ,great job by clayton it looked like it would be his second start in a row with no run support but the boys got it going go blue
54HDLzp-ntQ,good win again tonight boy
54HDLzp-ntQ,kimbrel slowly getting his location back cant wait to see him get on a roll
54HDLzp-ntQ,kershaw throws another gem on kershaw day 72 ip 1 er 10 ks lowers his era to 240 let him start the allstar game
54HDLzp-ntQ,good to see my dodgers get the win  back in 1st place in the nl conference
54HDLzp-ntQ,last pitch of the game was nastystarted over the plate and breaks to the shins  hard to hit that pitch
54HDLzp-ntQ,6 wins in row lets go
54HDLzp-ntQ,cubs are a great team and organization
54HDLzp-ntQ,its great to see lamb have success
54HDLzp-ntQ,the dodgers are on their way to move twenty games or more into first place by seasons end
54HDLzp-ntQ,jake and trayce have been that spark we needed
54HDLzp-ntQ,another big comeback win for my boys in blue keep this winning going boys sooner or later well be better than the yankees once more
54HDLzp-ntQ,thats what i like the most  playing hard to the end of the game
54HDLzp-ntQ,be still my heart when kimbrel comes in
54HDLzp-ntQ,freeman glove been clutchhope he keeps it up for the gold
54HDLzp-ntQ,breaking ball
54HDLzp-ntQ,kershaw deserved to start the allstar game
54HDLzp-ntQ,cubs first baseman caused that error stretched too early
54HDLzp-ntQ,kershaw stay with the dodgers
54HDLzp-ntQ,lets go blue
54HDLzp-ntQ,clayton kershaw future hall of fame
54HDLzp-ntQ,great game

54HDLzp-ntQ,and starting for the 2022 national league allstars number 22
54HDLzp-ntQ,comebacks are always easy against the cubs who usually manage to lay a big fat steamy late inning stinky
54HDLzp-ntQ,way to go dodgers
54HDLzp-ntQ,i expect the dodgers to win it all this year
54HDLzp-ntQ,the los angeles dodgers are 5529

54HDLzp-ntQ,thanks for putting this up after midnight
54HDLzp-ntQ,dodgers all day
54HDLzp-ntQ,looks like muncy is gonna be replaced by the new guys
54HDLzp-ntQ,bad footwork by cubs first baseman had the wrong foot on the bag if footwork was correct he could have caught the throw
54HDLzp-ntQ,the dodgers should release max muncy now its becoming a running gag every time he steps up to the plate
54HDLzp-ntQ,dodgers sweep the cubs 7for7
54HDLzp-ntQ,kershaw the goat for life
54HDLzp-ntQ,they just know how to win
54HDLzp-ntQ,why do they take so long to upload dodger games highlights half the time they miss the good stuff too
54HDLzp-ntQ,indiana folks going to be upset with me wearing my hometown dodgers jersey lol
54HDLzp-ntQ,bullpen letting cubs down again hard to take
54HDLzp-ntQ,finally they uploaded it
54HDLzp-ntQ,why does it take so long for dodgers games
54HDLzp-ntQ,go dodgers

5rexO9STVlo,johnson nominates boris johnson as the next leader of the conservative party
5rexO9STVlo,so we should trust the opinion of the people who elected boris to select the next glorious leader
5rexO9STVlo,how on earth can we go through 3 prime ministers in 67 years its becoming a joke
5rexO9STVlo,the polls that had none of the above and dont know as by far the top choices in the leadership race were absolutely spot on
5rexO9STVlo,hes sulking because everyone turned on him like he stabbed everyone else in the back
5rexO9STVlo,hes probably prepared statements backing them all and will use whichever is the most expedient just like his articles on brexit
5rexO9STVlo,we need general election with proportional representation
5rexO9STVlo,personally i wouldnt back anyone who stabbed me in the back and a saying comes to mind the ides of march even if it was a few months late
5rexO9STVlo,its a contest between who can make the already rich even richer
5rexO9STVlo,we need a general election with proportional representation
5rexO9STVlo,more like he thinks they all stabbed him in the back if you support one you have no leverage favours from the others
5rexO9STVlo,they make me want to puke
5rexO9STVlo,its a very sad day when a ukip person g useless actually has a voice in this debate
5rexO9STVlo,in 2010 the uk was a moderately prosperous eu member state with a recovering economy  and then george osborne happened
5rexO9STVlo,all this is becoming a bit of a farce lately im very concerned about the future of britain
5rexO9STVlo,hes not gone and if we dont act hes not going of course he wont name a preference his preference is him
5rexO9STVlo,roll on scottish independence
5rexO9STVlo,12 years of mismanagement and incompetence the tories are a mess

5rexO9STVlo,im not even halfway through this and im starting to feel quite queasy
5rexO9STVlo,boris was more of a visionary and got big projects done like brexit his sheer positivity or deluded optimism encouraged a lot of businesses and infrastructure projects
5rexO9STVlo,i am just baffled with how many elections national and internal the tories have ran in over a decade
5rexO9STVlo,i love the tory supporters wearing the dutch colours on his hat
5rexO9STVlo,maybe del boy can stand  this time next year well be millionaires
5rexO9STVlo,to which theyre no doubt thankful itd be like death resting his hand on your shoulder
5rexO9STVlo,if johnson cant back one let him front one
5rexO9STVlo,just say a penny for your thoughts boris
5rexO9STVlo,the problems are still brexit and the overtaxation of workers to subsidise corporate tax savings
5rexO9STVlo,boris is lying 
5rexO9STVlo,boris is doing a rishi and making an advance  video to become leader of the opposition in 2024 
5rexO9STVlo,bro he has resigned do you know what this means he has no roll in government
5rexO9STVlo,krishna does a wonderful job of interviewing himself  its kind of a struggle for the candidates to get in a word edgewise  us perspective
5rexO9STVlo,a collections of nogoods there is no hope
5rexO9STVlo,people saying boris this boris that are not even comparable to his night slippers
5rexO9STVlo,get the lot of them out  tired of the snob party
5rexO9STVlo,its terribly unfair people should stop saying unkind  things about all those nice multibillionaires in the tory party theyre lovely people and they really have our interests at heart

5rexO9STVlo,rory stewart for prime minister
5rexO9STVlo,i would say writing a book that promises the readers wealth when he doesnt have any yeah nah not that guy
5rexO9STVlo,this must be the weirdest nominations for pm ever
5rexO9STVlo,just give larry the job he lives there already and hes the only one i trust
5rexO9STVlo,i cant stand how they want to pitch sunaks upbringing as relatively modest
5rexO9STVlo,when brexit turns into brekshit well see who remains a brexiteer

SCMqrDGAYiE,elon is using twitter like the filthy floor mop that it is and succeeded in exposing them on a grand global scale priceless
SCMqrDGAYiE,instead of disclosing the bot info twitters going to take musk to court and have to disclose the info anyway
SCMqrDGAYiE,the house with hidden termites analogy tom made was perfect if twitter is found to be lying elon is gonna be laughing all the way to the bank again 
SCMqrDGAYiE,twitter was trying to catfish elon musk by misrepresenting the actual value of the company sounds pretty illegal to me
SCMqrDGAYiE,i would say elon now knows twitters deepest darkest secrets and now twitter is scared shitless
SCMqrDGAYiE,what i find hilarious about it all is that all the woke employees kicked and cried like little babies when it happened and now they want him to buy it
SCMqrDGAYiE,he is not trying to get a better deal he is trying to get them to show their real value
SCMqrDGAYiE,intentional or not  he exposed the gross hypocrisy of this organization and their disingenuous censors and fact
SCMqrDGAYiE,the future viability of the company is not affected by a stock price  whoever runs these news shows needs to train the regularly scheduled hosts on how finance works
SCMqrDGAYiE,no he cant
SCMqrDGAYiE,not if he has been lied to you definitely want to kick  twitters tires they are devious operators
SCMqrDGAYiE,this is getting more and more entertaining by the week
SCMqrDGAYiE,i dont think he should be force to buy twitter need to disclose the number of fake twitter accounts
SCMqrDGAYiE,twitter cant get away with not revealing the  info  thats the law
SCMqrDGAYiE,when musk makes a decision itll be the right one 
SCMqrDGAYiE,when elon wasnt saying anything everyone at fox news was attacking him  now he responded with greater confidence you are supporting him
SCMqrDGAYiE,elon musk is not worried about twitter one way or the other
SCMqrDGAYiE,i havent laughed like this in months  well played elon  well played
SCMqrDGAYiE,the fact that there is a penalty clause in the deal clearly indicates that they cannot force him to buy it
SCMqrDGAYiE,chuck mate that is pure gold happy maga month to all the patriots out there god bless america lets go brandon
SCMqrDGAYiE,he wont buy it his mission was to expose just  what trash twitter actually  is mission accomplished
SCMqrDGAYiE,its pretty simple when you look at itwhen you buy something you have a right to know exactly what your money is buyingthats what this boils down to
SCMqrDGAYiE,twitter mis represented the companys worth  elon can back out if he wants  twitter is no longer worth what they are asking
SCMqrDGAYiE,no he can not be forced to buy a company providing false information and records
SCMqrDGAYiE,in one of my videos i explained why elon musk would create his social platform from scratch but first he will lower his competitors to their true positions
SCMqrDGAYiE,when musk made the announcement that he was going to buy twitter trump said back in may said it will never happen
SCMqrDGAYiE,he could be buying up shares at the current price leaving him less to pay out in the long runif he still wants to
SCMqrDGAYiE,this is not a good question for the judge its a question for forensic analysts
SCMqrDGAYiE,elon musk likes to play with the sheep its all a game and hes having fun
SCMqrDGAYiE,no one should be able to force anyone to buy anything this idea is nuts how unamerican can you get
SCMqrDGAYiE,there is only one thing to do when a prospect fails due diligence bury it
SCMqrDGAYiE,how much truth is there in this and when the actual bots are revealed as advertisers were possibly frauded
SCMqrDGAYiE,could you imagine the cry that you would hear from the libatruds if someone actually tried to force them to buy something they didnt want
SCMqrDGAYiE,you cant make a man with 200 billion do anythingbut laugh
SCMqrDGAYiE,i lost some  on twitter but absolutely love how elons putting them in their place
SCMqrDGAYiE,this is why good ol musky is one of my favorite humans to ever exist lmao
SCMqrDGAYiE,elon check mate
SCMqrDGAYiE,elon is a
SCMqrDGAYiE,to get financial freedom you have to be making money while youre asleep
SCMqrDGAYiE,here we go news reporters finally got a new story to start rumors about elon that they know nothing about  lets  see all the different options that everyone has
SCMqrDGAYiE,i feel like elon has more than one brain
SCMqrDGAYiE,elon musk is gonna crush twitter
SCMqrDGAYiE,they already spent a tone of cashthis annulment in the deal leaves them cashless and broke and to me that is awesome
SCMqrDGAYiE,did the five discuss two provisions of the contract to which elon supposedly agreed
SCMqrDGAYiE,musk says he will buy twitter twitter board inserts poison pill and stock falls then musk says sike
SCMqrDGAYiE,love your round table interesting analysis today
SCMqrDGAYiE,elon stay strong
SCMqrDGAYiE,i seriously doubt that any one could force musk to do any thing
SCMqrDGAYiE,isnt  that what the 1 billion buyout if the  deal doesnt go through is for
SCMqrDGAYiE,love it
SCMqrDGAYiE,so if they force him to buy it the first thing he can do is fire all of the board members and send them packing
SCMqrDGAYiE,elon is a genius his mind probably runs 100 mpr at all times that is the reason he smokes
SCMqrDGAYiE,they might be able to force him to do it but it wont be at the price they are wanting after he gets done with them in court
SCMqrDGAYiE,and at the same time he thought oh crap i might have to pay for ambers lawsuit
SCMqrDGAYiE,its his money he could do whatever he want
SCMqrDGAYiE,awesome episode love all you guys even if this isnt a bot
SCMqrDGAYiE,elon is the terminator
SCMqrDGAYiE,elon should log onto youtube and come here for advice
SCMqrDGAYiE,you can make an offer and it can even be accepted but that doesnt mean you have to follow through until theres a signed legal document by the parties involved
SCMqrDGAYiE,the termites analogy was spot on bots need to be exposed before sale
SCMqrDGAYiE,elon musk is going to get it as a gift
SCMqrDGAYiE,can twitter be compelled in court to disclose their bot statistics going to court may be exactly the worst thing for that company
SCMqrDGAYiE,twitter will embarrassingly tweet themselves in front of a judge
SCMqrDGAYiE,this just inelon musk buys planet earthpromising to move it further away from the sunto please all the climate alarmistlol
SCMqrDGAYiE,i cant wait till the discovery in the lawsuit happens
SCMqrDGAYiE,it would be cheaper for elon to just buy an island  start his own country with punitive tariffs a standing military  nuclear armed rockets elon is invulnerable
SCMqrDGAYiE,musk knew that twitter was mostly bots before he bid
SCMqrDGAYiE,price of twitter will drop to pennies dollarwhen elon crushes  the counter part
SCMqrDGAYiE,no rich people dont have to do the things they say but they should be held accountable for it though
SCMqrDGAYiE,why save a sinking ship full of bots and aholes start your own twitter elon
SCMqrDGAYiE,musk backing out of the deal makes twitter look like a bad investment
SCMqrDGAYiE,the big question is will a judge force discovery of ndas particularly ndas with the federal government
SCMqrDGAYiE,good luck forcing the sale im making sure im stocked up on popcorn when discovery starts
SCMqrDGAYiE,twitter doesnt dare get dragged into a civil court roomthey have to answer questions
SCMqrDGAYiE,troll of the century
SCMqrDGAYiE,i knew it was good to be true he wont buy it and twitter will stay awful rather than buying it and fixing it thanks elon
SCMqrDGAYiE,all i want to do is this i just want to find 11780 votes which is one more than we have fellas i need 11000 votes give me a break
SCMqrDGAYiE,no he can go to court and be forced to pay damages or prove they lied to him about bots and subcribers
SCMqrDGAYiE,he shouldnt have to buy twitter but he just wanted to devalue its stock that should be illegal
SCMqrDGAYiE,i hope elon wins and buys twitter in the end then comes for youtube facebook next
SCMqrDGAYiE,elon is playing chest while twitter is sitting in a corner eating glue either was twitter will have to disclose the actual numbers and that what elon is after
SCMqrDGAYiE,this ought to be a good one trying to force someone to buy something they dont want

64SM6mKnaVo,an awesome engineering feat no matter the shortcomings  perfect for tourists
64SM6mKnaVo,that tilt shift image used in the thumbnail looks incredible to me its like a star wars star destroyer or something
64SM6mKnaVo,i like how you used mostly b footage of american lcacs
64SM6mKnaVo,this zubrclass lcac seems to be outdated with todays weapons i would think this thing would be heard coming for miles i may be wrong
64SM6mKnaVo,i love how it showed a navy lcac in the video
64SM6mKnaVo,3040 odd metres to the gallon about the same as a 160000 ton 1112 feet cruise ship  i wonder how much to get moving up to speed
64SM6mKnaVo,yep russia needs tremendous things to carry huge tanks so that toy drones can blow them up
64SM6mKnaVo,they look like easy targets for neptune and harpoon missiles impressive boats though
64SM6mKnaVo,wait  russia has only two of these  hardly a ringing endorsement of their value
64SM6mKnaVo,good thing its equipped with a magnetic compass without it you never know  might invade a neighbor while off one exercise
64SM6mKnaVo,when looking at the thumbnail i thought the hovercraft was the thing in the foreground when the beast appeared to  me from the background and blew my mind
64SM6mKnaVo,great piece of kit from an engineering point of view
64SM6mKnaVo,uhdidnt some of that footage have vessels with us navy printed on the side damned clever of those soviets much better than stupid old camouflage
64SM6mKnaVo,coming from somewhere deep inside my head i can hear a song c  c thang
64SM6mKnaVo,at the risk of sounding critical i didnt know the russians had had us military uniforms and humvees
64SM6mKnaVo,useful transport for arctic warfare can ride right across ice floes
64SM6mKnaVo,not enough b roll either that or the us navy is using them too
64SM6mKnaVo,can we use this type of hovercraft as a landcruiser
64SM6mKnaVo,best if only used against undefended shores
64SM6mKnaVo,ah the zubr class underwater assault submarine soon to join the moskva guided missile submarine
64SM6mKnaVo,great work keep it up
64SM6mKnaVo,make a great diving attraction off the ukrainian coast
64SM6mKnaVo,holy hell thats massiveyikes
64SM6mKnaVo,looks like an easy target
64SM6mKnaVo,yeah i didnt know the russians had humvees
64SM6mKnaVo,looks like a valuable target in times of war one well placed sea mine or anti ship missile could go a long way
64SM6mKnaVo,how many of these one of a kind craft did you say there were
64SM6mKnaVo,lots wrong
64SM6mKnaVo,impressive but i dont think many countries including russia would use such a craft they are too vulnerable to truck and man launched missiles to be useful
64SM6mKnaVo,one massive target for a drone
64SM6mKnaVo,seems a perfect target for some javelins take out the three propulsion fans
64SM6mKnaVo,lol at the author having to use mostly us hovercraft footage because the us ones actually are functional
64SM6mKnaVo,great targets
64SM6mKnaVo,anyone notice that all close in footage was from u s lcac maneuvers  how many russian vessels carry us navy markings just wondering
64SM6mKnaVo,disclaimer half of the footage isnt russian its us landing craft and its deployment from a lhd
64SM6mKnaVo,6 barrel automatic gun shows an unguided rocket pod
64SM6mKnaVo,read the title incorrectly as giant russian hovercraft in acton and shat myself for a sec ooh its fuckin kicking off lads
64SM6mKnaVo,that would make another nice artificial reef in the black sea
64SM6mKnaVo,the lcac shown is adorned with the flag of greece
64SM6mKnaVo,with putin in charge its like the clock is running backwards on russia
64SM6mKnaVo,but how does this hover beast get to the battle area no way would this be well traveled as an open water craft
64SM6mKnaVo,post ukraine  anything russian has lost my consumer confidence i regret to inform everyone here that i wont be purchasing any russian aircraft carrierdestroyers anytime soon
64SM6mKnaVo,monstrous they are
64SM6mKnaVo,one missile and the entire thing is toast so useless unless using it to start wars with weaker countries ahhh makes sense now
64SM6mKnaVo,what a lovely looking slow target vessel
64SM6mKnaVo,and when they deploy it it will fall apart and break down
64SM6mKnaVo,if you make a video on russian lcacs do not mix in imagery of us lcacs without commenting on the differences or explaining why the footage is in very sloppy
64SM6mKnaVo,this will provide mobility year round in the arctic
64SM6mKnaVo,the russian navy has plans to
64SM6mKnaVo,very cool
64SM6mKnaVo,shame theres so much footage of us craft while talking about soviet ones
64SM6mKnaVo,russia cant even afford to maintain their current equipment i highly doubt theyll be able to afford to build more of these
64SM6mKnaVo,most impressive
64SM6mKnaVo,how many rounds and rockets can that skirt take
64SM6mKnaVo,so cool
64SM6mKnaVo,please make a video about the bora guided missile hovercraft surface effect ship
64SM6mKnaVo,we keep seeing what is obviously us craft
64SM6mKnaVo,i wouldnt be surprised if these started popping up in different places
64SM6mKnaVo,can pronounce lcac as elkak
64SM6mKnaVo,it aint no aluminum falcon shout out to the meus
64SM6mKnaVo,needs to be target by rockets
64SM6mKnaVo,i want one
64SM6mKnaVo,i wonder what the profit margin is on 1 of these
64SM6mKnaVo,wow just wow the ukranians could blow that boat into pieces with an american harpoon missile
64SM6mKnaVo,im so confused i keep seeing humves and us stamped on the sides of the vehicles
64SM6mKnaVo,what are you trying to pass off as a russian gun at
64SM6mKnaVo,huh  two in the ukrainian navy  i thought ukrainian navy was unfortunately destroyed in 2014 
64SM6mKnaVo,big boat big target
64SM6mKnaVo,ill look like a nice artificial reef soon
64SM6mKnaVo,is it better than the channel hovercrafts
64SM6mKnaVo,which came first usa or russian lcac
64SM6mKnaVo,so when did russia start using humvee 
64SM6mKnaVo,dont mix american and russian equipment in the video if youre talking about one or the other
64SM6mKnaVo,would those be able to make it across the pacific
64SM6mKnaVo,great much larger targets for the ukraine
64SM6mKnaVo,i like your channel but some of your video and pictures dont correlate with your description
64SM6mKnaVo,uhu super duper if used in ukraine it will be largest destroyed hovercraft
64SM6mKnaVo,a big box with lots of fans on it a few guns
64SM6mKnaVo,excellent video
64SM6mKnaVo,zubr is that target in ruzzian
64SM6mKnaVo,still hiding from ukrainian neptune missiles
64SM6mKnaVo,10 rubles says it dont float no more

lpnVExPH22Q,wherever dneg plays is the main event
lpnVExPH22Q,gonna miss the wsop vlogs its the sad time of year where its winding down
lpnVExPH22Q,have you asked the player if he had the flush with a2 we want to know and i think you were right lol
lpnVExPH22Q,oh dnegs will take his chances where he can making his opponent lay down top two there  heads up play repping the straight daniel  heads up play

lpnVExPH22Q,daniel the lush
lpnVExPH22Q,its funny how you can hear the rumble bumps as you are driving
lpnVExPH22Q,i love how you talk about coffees like they are lives in a video game lol
lpnVExPH22Q,i would like to express my own opinion here 1 dnegs has been the best ambassador to poker of all time
lpnVExPH22Q,hey daniel you should know romaniens dosen get covid cmon matehopely your hand will hold
lpnVExPH22Q,great entertainment ty for giving to commnity
lpnVExPH22Q,straight flush
lpnVExPH22Q,i think its incorrect to fold that diamonds hand at
lpnVExPH22Q,hey dnegs im curious whats your goto coffee of choice
lpnVExPH22Q,you have lost more in a month than i have made in my whole life living your best life
lpnVExPH22Q,daniel drunk is one of those guys love you man but good thing your at private party outside your bubble that drunk would not be good  be careful my friend
lpnVExPH22Q,i had to watch it im a little behind love you man
lpnVExPH22Q,somehow poker seems dull after the party the people want the amdashow back
lpnVExPH22Q,hey mr you have some selfawareness about your drinking but it was more than being just loud  stick to coconut water it took me many years to figure that out
lpnVExPH22Q,daniel has the oldest pups on the planet
lpnVExPH22Q,i didnt hit anyone that hard just small taps dnegs is going to end up in court one of these days
lpnVExPH22Q,daniels vegan sandwich from no butcher looked pretty good
lpnVExPH22Q,dont like the fold with the king high flush daniel im surprised you didnt rethink that should have seen one more card
lpnVExPH22Q,wow still looking at your cell while actually driving hopefully it doesnt take a bad situation for you to put that thing down like your vlogs though
lpnVExPH22Q,there is only 1 way to turn this wsop around  call stanley cup champ phil the thrill kessel for some inspiration

O0gbfvJDsv4,with the same price as 5900x id rather have the 4 extra cores
O0gbfvJDsv4,anthony is getting really a lot more comfortable in front of camera and his charisma and showmanship is improving linus can definitely retire at some point
O0gbfvJDsv4,i bought a ryzen 7 last year and it still goes hard
O0gbfvJDsv4,anthony forgot to mention that their intel 12900kks system used very expensive ddr5 memory kit in his conclusion probably costs as much as the entire 5800x3d cpu by itself
O0gbfvJDsv4,id recommend a used 5900x over this chip for less money personally
O0gbfvJDsv4,so i am running a 3900x now my system is only for gaming minus the occasional streaming i just ordered this new cpu i dont think ill regret it
O0gbfvJDsv4,ive been rocking the 5800x for about a year now and i can confidently say i see no reason to upgrade any time soon

T1ZnAwUg9CU,we all know what that growtent is actually going to be used for when this video is over nice way to get lmg to buy your grow equipment for you
T1ZnAwUg9CU,the ducting needs to have as few bends as possible each bend affects the airspeed also placing the fan as close to the exit as possible should improve air exchange
T1ZnAwUg9CU,this is literally the we arent paying to air condition the neighborhood moment
T1ZnAwUg9CU,alex you may want to put a covering over the exit to prevent bugs from entering
T1ZnAwUg9CU,for my fellow americans the
T1ZnAwUg9CU,used these tents for many things having this connected to the exhaust of the house air exchanger makes a big difference in winter flip it to keep the heat in
T1ZnAwUg9CU,alex went from being hes okay but a little quiet to one of my favourites on ltt
T1ZnAwUg9CU,i did something similar except i attached the duct directly to the back exhaust and fans every foot up to the window mightve been easier and more compact than this
T1ZnAwUg9CU,you should route the intake from outside as well this setup will drive up the homes ac costs
T1ZnAwUg9CU,i like my solution better blackout curtains with reflective foil on the outer side  ac works like a charm
T1ZnAwUg9CU,another cheap option powered vent registers i installed one in my room and the difference is insane and pulls about the same power as a 5w usb
T1ZnAwUg9CU,something tells me that just putting a fan in the window would have the same effect  the biggest thermal improvement to the room was creating airflow
T1ZnAwUg9CU,making content from tips the employees do on their own homes is pretty awesome hope to see more
T1ZnAwUg9CU,definitely would recommend 3d printing some ceiling mounts for that ducting keeping it up in the ceiling would be even better
T1ZnAwUg9CU,this honestly is a great way to stop your room getting hot in the summer when your pc is blasting out heat
T1ZnAwUg9CU,love the idea really neat but there should be a more compact version gf approved of course lol imho
T1ZnAwUg9CU,i continue to love the series of weird ass cooling solutions that alex comes up with
T1ZnAwUg9CU,i wonder if you did this with the fan in reverse how well would it work to keep dust out of your computer in a workshop
T1ZnAwUg9CU,i was definitely not expecting and am continually impressed by the broad range of knowledge and skillset exhibited here at ltt
T1ZnAwUg9CU,maybe you could have on 1 window an ac unit venting cold air into an intake on a second window have the exhaust thatd be overkill tho
T1ZnAwUg9CU,interested in alexs background hes clearly got an engineering background of some kind but hes also super practical and hand on which in my experience is quite rare now
T1ZnAwUg9CU,anyone noticed how alex always gets a reason to use the big laser or any of the other shop tools
T1ZnAwUg9CU,depending on your climate just install an evaporative cooler in your house
T1ZnAwUg9CU,this can also have the added benefit of extra filtration of all the air into the pc environment inside of the tent
T1ZnAwUg9CU,in my opinion a much better design would be to have the tent as sealed as possible with two pipes
T1ZnAwUg9CU,brilliant video i think youre actually on to something and now you need to make your own ltt branded pc cooler tent
T1ZnAwUg9CU,i love this kind of content and a perfect time to release the shop jacket awesome
T1ZnAwUg9CU,i feel as if this idea is coming to lttstore soon i feel with labs opening up one could make a more sleek  from of this and market it
T1ZnAwUg9CU,hey alex have you thought about just covering the outtakes of your case
T1ZnAwUg9CU,try some reflective film on your windows should keep some of the heat we use this on our office windows and it seems to have worked
T1ZnAwUg9CU,wouldnt have just installing the extractor directly out of the window had a similar effect
T1ZnAwUg9CU,seems like you could get the same result with a dryer hose connected to a custom 120mm shroud off the rear outlet on the pc and the same oversized fan
T1ZnAwUg9CU,imagine a land where houses dont have air conditioning  sometimes i think an episode can be too geographically themed
T1ZnAwUg9CU,the horizontal bars you were confused by during assembly are included for hanging lightsfans on
T1ZnAwUg9CU,the good part of the grow tent being too big is that you can grow a plant next to your pc ready for those extra long gaming sessions
T1ZnAwUg9CU,i thought about this recently wanting to just put the heat outside instead of having the computer heat my room lol

aYdRonak8bg,i love when she acts like her opinion on fashion hasnt shaped almost a whole generation of girls fashion we love a humble queen
aYdRonak8bg,i love that she gives her opinion without insulting the style of anyone else
aYdRonak8bg,yall call her basic but in my opinion she started the whole aesthetic fashion trend
aYdRonak8bg,timestamps because i have no life
aYdRonak8bg,she says her opinion doesnt matter but it obviously does all the trends are because of her
aYdRonak8bg,i hope she knows her opinion does it really does matter
aYdRonak8bg,lets be realemma could pull off literally any fashion trend
aYdRonak8bg,i feel like cheetah looks more classy when the spots are small but when theyre bigthat looks more tacky
aYdRonak8bg,i dont really like neon colors but on dark skinned people omg its amazing
aYdRonak8bg,if emma got a mullet it would probably break the internet
aYdRonak8bg,e girl is literally middle school emo  reincarnated for anyone who graduated before 2010
aYdRonak8bg,she sounds like a lot of girls moms i think thats why shes got everybody listening to her
aYdRonak8bg,i love how she doesnt want anyone to get hurt or offended of her opinions
aYdRonak8bg,emma yoga pants make me feel like an 80s aerobics instructor
aYdRonak8bg,back in the day americans laughed at the germans for wearing birkenstocks with socks now everyone does it and its somehow kinda trendy
aYdRonak8bg,me finally realising that 99 of todays global trends started in british private schools
aYdRonak8bg,the fact that she was probably like  yeah ill just pull over and film a video real quick will always amaze me
aYdRonak8bg,finally someone who agrees biker shorts are disgusting and shouldnt exist
aYdRonak8bg,she literally makes the worst trends look badass thats a talent for me
aYdRonak8bg,whos idea was it to make fingerless gloves popular in a pandemic
aYdRonak8bg,i totally agree with the cowprint one its like what happened with the tennis skirts and sweater combo its so popular that it doesnt feel unique and loses its speciality
aYdRonak8bg,emma i hate vnecks
aYdRonak8bg,emma with a mullet would look so sick but i truly wanna see her with bangs and layers with a lot of texture i just envision it
aYdRonak8bg,chunky filas

P4fYVxP7Vkc,just like your theory on why company logos are getting more and more simplified and worse looks like their products are doing so as well
P4fYVxP7Vkc,proud to say that when toblerone made their bars smaller i quit as their social media manager
P4fYVxP7Vkc,ive noticed the change in shape of the cereal boxes before because i always buy the family size also im pretty sure snickers have gotten smaller over the years
P4fYVxP7Vkc,food products arent only getting smaller theyre also getting less nutritious and less healthy due to using lowerquality ingredients to save production costs
P4fYVxP7Vkc,my friend has caught this with some brands with bags of milk we have in ontario canada she has sent photos to the company asking them to explain
P4fYVxP7Vkc,finally were tackling the topic of shrinkflation an especially bad problem in the wake of covid thanks for covering this theory crew
P4fYVxP7Vkc,thank you for covering this
P4fYVxP7Vkc,food theory you should try and make cupcakes with coffee sugarssweeteners that you get in mini packets
P4fYVxP7Vkc,ive known about this issue for at least 20 years happy to see it hitting mainstream
P4fYVxP7Vkc,been seeing some get smaller over the years grandma cookies the bigger one used to a decent size and now smaller and the oatmeal creme pies being the same
P4fYVxP7Vkc,literally yesterday i was thinking hey this big mac looks way smaller i dont go to macdonalds often so if they did change it gradually i feel like id notice
P4fYVxP7Vkc,my supermarket lists the price per kilo on everything
P4fYVxP7Vkc,our family always gets suspicious and disappointed when a food product has new look same great taste we go oh great how are they ripping us off this time
P4fYVxP7Vkc,this was probably one of the best topics youve tackled so far keep it up
P4fYVxP7Vkc,finally someone is admitting that there is high inflation right now most major news outlets try to cover it up
P4fYVxP7Vkc,i literally just noticed this yesterday the granola bars ive been eating for years felt a few grams lighter and comparing the boxes they have shrunk
P4fYVxP7Vkc,there are tons of similar examples in other arenas including cyber security politics you name it and medicine when money is king scams tricks and competitive psychology will take over
P4fYVxP7Vkc,shrinkflation is insidious we cut back to keep your prices the same however there is still 8 inflation so youre paying more for less
P4fYVxP7Vkc,ive noticed this lays and doritos have so much fewer chips in the bags now
P4fYVxP7Vkc,in brazil theres a law that makes it mandatory for the companies to clearly state in the package that the product is smallerlighter when they do it
P4fYVxP7Vkc,i wonder what companies would do if we all just went for the cheapest option possible for every product cheapest per gramounce
P4fYVxP7Vkc,inflation is hitting everyone  weird how the method for fighting inflation is
P4fYVxP7Vkc,ive actually noticed the same thing with zbars theyve decreased the size of the bars themselves substantially
P4fYVxP7Vkc,as a child of the 70s yes im old af i started to notice shrinkflation in the 90s
P4fYVxP7Vkc,same thing is happening for crisco oil the old were 48 ounces and the new are 40 ounces but the price is the same
P4fYVxP7Vkc,thx to this channel im being more aware of food products thx for the information matpat ill try to keep my eyes out for sneaky stuff like this
P4fYVxP7Vkc,love the vids of you exposing underhanded corporate practices keep em coming
P4fYVxP7Vkc,someone is stealing from you
P4fYVxP7Vkc,as a retail worker in canada having to change the shelf spacings on this just to accommodate new packaging designs i see this all the time
P4fYVxP7Vkc,i already knew they was doing this my parents told me this as a child but its good to see youre bringing it out
P4fYVxP7Vkc,that was a reall great and imformative episode thanks team theorist
P4fYVxP7Vkc,its amazing how it takes people now to realize this i have always checked the price per oz
P4fYVxP7Vkc,i still remember a juice i used to buy in my childhood with a net value of 330 grams
P4fYVxP7Vkc,the subject of shrinkflation was interesting enough for me to write a college essay about it thank you for the video and the idea
P4fYVxP7Vkc,i noticed it with cadbury creme eggs
P4fYVxP7Vkc,he obviously took inflation into account but its about how sneaky companies are about it and how they willing they are to lie instead of being truthful
P4fYVxP7Vkc,i have actually been in a cadbury factory and its still shocking that they did that
P4fYVxP7Vkc,i noticed this with girl scout cookies i refuse to buy any at all now the prices went up and there is more space between cookies equaling less cookies
P4fYVxP7Vkc,shrinkflation at its finest thank you democrats your doing a bang up job accross board

qc3eril0sQI,look at all the dereliction of this administration
qc3eril0sQI,they should have picked up and recorded it would have been another perfect call
qc3eril0sQI,i really enjoy the comments  show what people really think  thanks for keeping it available and open
qc3eril0sQI,you guys understand they cant present any of this as evidence against anyone right
qc3eril0sQI,has mainstream media become so homogeneous that every reporter is just a clone of the same person now these guys are basically twins
qc3eril0sQI,when she loses in november cbs should hire her she would fit right in to ultra bias reporting
qc3eril0sQI,they can find out where the call came from who made it  they do it all the time with private citizenscome on now
qc3eril0sQI,i sure do wish that witness took trumps call and recorded it without a recording or witness or vm as evidence no criminal act was made
qc3eril0sQI,this is all ray eppss fault he planned to enter the building the night before with others
qc3eril0sQI,hes amazing  we love scott
qc3eril0sQI,nothing absolutely nothing will come from this because it comes from congress
qc3eril0sQI,trump calling a witness  who never even took the call  to say happy birthday is not illegal
qc3eril0sQI,when will the secret service agents be testifying
qc3eril0sQI,oh no trump tried to make a phone call quick get the pitchforks
qc3eril0sQI,what a joke these people are they cant even be viewed as serious  unbelievable they are paid for this bs lets go brandon and the rest of you cronies 
qc3eril0sQI,monmouth poll ranks top concerns of americans jan 6 didnt even make the list
qc3eril0sQI,so just because cheyney says trump tried to call that makes it true
qc3eril0sQI,liz cheney is the epitome of being a karen gonna be funny when everyone on this committee gets voted out
qc3eril0sQI,cant wait to see lizs career end and the truth come out after midterms
qc3eril0sQI,omghow dare he
qc3eril0sQI,cheney saysdid they make the supposed contacts public because i sure didnt see anythingshow us some phone records
qc3eril0sQI,liz is history 
qc3eril0sQI,cheney is trying so hard to be relevant lol
qc3eril0sQI,another perfect call
qc3eril0sQI,armed with a flag and a hockey stick and a pocket knife really is that any kind of deadly revolutionlol
qc3eril0sQI,missing something trump called an undisclosed future witness so how did he know the person was a witness
qc3eril0sQI,cheney says to keep the democratic donations coming its not looking so hot for her in the upcoming primary keep throwing money at establishment war hawks
qc3eril0sQI,oh yeah  you cracked the case liz
qc3eril0sQI,i keep missing all the cross examination to the witnesses
qc3eril0sQI,the best thing to come out of this witchhunt is that cheney will lose her office
qc3eril0sQI,dont do the crime if you cant do the time
qc3eril0sQI,tried to contact
qc3eril0sQI,i swear if this actually goes to court and he gets convicted ill personally be sure this country stays free
qc3eril0sQI,cbs and cheney two things not to put any faith in for decency and truth
qc3eril0sQI,cant wait to see the cross examinations
qc3eril0sQI,cipolloni whats the overstock guy doing here
qc3eril0sQI,this is another russia russia russia thing
qc3eril0sQI,i am starting to realize that liz cheney is a very unbalanced individual
qc3eril0sQI,one thing liz has done is convince me that maybe some fetuses do need aborted
qc3eril0sQI,we still going on with this bs
qc3eril0sQI,i wish liz had gone hunting with her father
qc3eril0sQI,liz is really grasping for anything that will make her relevant these days her time in dc is coming to an end and she knows it
qc3eril0sQI,if the witness isnt public knowledge then how does contacting someone that you dont even know is a witness witness tampering lmfao
qc3eril0sQI,we have witnesses that dont have evidence
qc3eril0sQI,the insurrection where everyone forgot to bring a single weapon of any kind with them
qc3eril0sQI,people are standing up to him  report him keep it coming
qc3eril0sQI,is this like adam schiff i have the evidence but i wont allow anyone to see it thing
qc3eril0sQI,give it up liz its all a joke
qc3eril0sQI,vote out cheney please wyoming
qc3eril0sQI,liz should have gone hunting with her father more often
qc3eril0sQI,these guys are straight bobble heads
qc3eril0sQI,not even a mile from witness tampering what a waste of time
qc3eril0sQI,by jan 6th committee witnesses do they mean his own staffers or the prisoners they have locked up without bail
qc3eril0sQI,key word says how many degrees of separation between the hearing and said hearsay again
qc3eril0sQI,i literally lol at anything she says hes just not into you sweetheart
qc3eril0sQI,but but
qc3eril0sQI,glad to see people are aware of this nonsense and fed up
qc3eril0sQI,nothing burgers all day god bless america
qc3eril0sQI,this such a joke go away liz
qc3eril0sQI,liz should enjoy it while she can  its hardly illegal to contact someone anyone
qc3eril0sQI,everyone but me is racist liz cheney
qc3eril0sQI,this shows that trump is now getting desperate and his cronies are no longer prepared to do his dirty work for him so he has to do it himself
qc3eril0sQI,mid october wow
qc3eril0sQI,okay is this a trial
qc3eril0sQI,many of these witnesses worked for him and are his friends this circus is not a trial there is no wrongdoing even if he did reach out to anyone
qc3eril0sQI,cheney should have gone hunting more with her father
qc3eril0sQI,bru how yall still talking about trump
qc3eril0sQI,that witness should have taken the call and then recorded it  this way no one would have been able to deny that trump tried to influence a witness
qc3eril0sQI,cheney is flailing before the midterms see ya at the polls
qc3eril0sQI,shes going to be voted out
qc3eril0sQI,he invited
qc3eril0sQI,trumps strategy has always been if you get caught doing something bad do something else bad to shift public attention away from the first thing
qc3eril0sQI,liz cheney and her war criminal father are totally trustworthy not establishment rats at all
qc3eril0sQI,never ending witch hunt
qc3eril0sQI,fealty the newest republican value
qc3eril0sQI,this committee is a waste of money
qc3eril0sQI,its like the inmates are running the asylum
qc3eril0sQI,maybe he wanted to say hello i personally dont care im going with ron desantis all the way
qc3eril0sQI,shes really going after the white turkey and doesnt want him to run again
qc3eril0sQI,fortunately this isnt a trial but muh witness tampering isnt a thing lol

JnF_By5dbX4,this is an impeachable action
JnF_By5dbX4,that should be considered an act of treason to our country and be an impeachable offense
JnF_By5dbX4,i didnt vote for joe  im not the idiot that voted for joe
JnF_By5dbX4,if this is true would this qualify as an impeachable offense for intentionally sabotaging the economy
JnF_By5dbX4,in the old days this guy would have been impeached already
JnF_By5dbX4,lets all say the word traitor
JnF_By5dbX4,as americans if we dont stand up to this then we will only have ourselves to blame
JnF_By5dbX4,what else would you expect from a person who sends us military overseas to protect foreign countries and doesnt send any military to the southern border to protect the us
JnF_By5dbX4,so we have skyrocketing fuel prices and he sends our reserves to someone else got it
JnF_By5dbX4,i hope every democrat is happy with what theyve done to this country
JnF_By5dbX4,this should be an impeachable action ffsone of dozens
JnF_By5dbX4,america last  joe biden
JnF_By5dbX4,just when i thought biden and his administration couldnt get any worse they always get worse this madness must stop immediately
JnF_By5dbX4,this is treasonous this is absolutely infuriating we are at levels that low when i am paying over double what i used to pay
JnF_By5dbX4,the whole world is laughing at the white house russians said we dont need to attack americans they are self destructive
JnF_By5dbX4,serious question outside of supplying allies in an actual war have we ever before sent our reserves to other countries
JnF_By5dbX4,i never imagined id be happy to see unleaded regular drop to 469
JnF_By5dbX4,this whole administration needs to be removed from power
JnF_By5dbX4,need to start protesting bidens policies
JnF_By5dbX4,im getting tired of this administrations blatant lies cowardice disrespect and betrayal of its people
JnF_By5dbX4,draining our reserve with no plans to refill going as his plan as he said
JnF_By5dbX4,biden is like a rich person on the titanic hes grabbing all the silverware on the way to the life boat
JnF_By5dbX4,he has to make sure his familys business dealings go smoothly did anyone honestly believe this man wasnt corrupt
JnF_By5dbX4,really the most frustrating thing is that there are united states citizens who support the draining the strategic oil reserves and also still support joe biden
JnF_By5dbX4,american people  can biden get any worse
JnF_By5dbX4,i asked my husband this morning if its possible to impeach an entire administration not just biden all of his cabinet needs impeached
JnF_By5dbX4,imagine saying reportedly for a fact
JnF_By5dbX4,he should be helping americans first
JnF_By5dbX4,the question really should be why is he sending our oil to our enemy
JnF_By5dbX4,what happens when your strategic reserves run out then youll need a million barrels a day just to move and that doesnt put a drop back into strategic reserves
JnF_By5dbX4,we need to have a hearing on this the way they have been doing to trump
JnF_By5dbX4,completely freakin outrageous these people could care less about us or our country its sickening
JnF_By5dbX4,he needs to be impeached now  i never thought id be saying this but trump shouldve won honestly
JnF_By5dbX4,he is exhausting the spr on purpose hes working for china russia or both
JnF_By5dbX4,i didnt think they could do something to make me this upset i worked late last night and woke up to this report as the first thing i see
JnF_By5dbX4,when you are compromised blackmailed i guess everything is on the table
JnF_By5dbX4,given how he rides a bicycle i hope he decides to try skydiving next
JnF_By5dbX4,get rid of fossil fuels what do you think powers our antiquated electrical grid that powers our electric cars
JnF_By5dbX4,they know exactly what there doing  intentional absolutely
JnF_By5dbX4,why are we send our reserves overseas and then begging overseas oil producers for more oil  for the united states
JnF_By5dbX4,id like to hear why he felt the need to export these barrels to these countries that would be fun to hear him answer that question
JnF_By5dbX4,it is nancy pelosis responsibility to bring up charges against him since she is the speaker of the house
JnF_By5dbX4,wheres all the protesters in dc demanding this mans resignation we need a nationwide protest
JnF_By5dbX4,no worries only 2 and a half more years of this to go  thanks a lot brandumb voters
JnF_By5dbX4,lowering our oil reserve is a nation security risk especially in these times this oil reserve is for the united states of america not some countries overseas
JnF_By5dbX4,he sent our oil reserves for emergency purposes to china   with a president like him we must be the laughing stock of the world
JnF_By5dbX4,unless the sending it away is a strategic move for some ulterior purposes like intentionally driving up prices
JnF_By5dbX4,hes gonna give it all away till theres none left just like everything not a smart guy not a smart guy
JnF_By5dbX4,my parents always taught me that choices have ramifications if observing our president doesnt underline that i dont know what does
JnF_By5dbX4,so hes literally aiding our enemies and hes not in cuffs
JnF_By5dbX4,i really wish someone would take biden out of our misery
JnF_By5dbX4,me joe you cant just sell out oil when our country needs it
JnF_By5dbX4,theres no coverage on this we need to share as much as we can
JnF_By5dbX4,the thing people really arent  looking at is why is our oil good for everybody even the biggest polluters in the world but not us
JnF_By5dbX4,this man is insane we still have 2 more years of this we will go under it this keeps up smh
JnF_By5dbX4,i cant even watch the whole clip this administration is disgusting curls my stomach
JnF_By5dbX4,dear white house type up a resignation letter and send it to biden he will sign anything
JnF_By5dbX4,imagine being a democrat and having to pretend that biden is competent
JnF_By5dbX4,the hits just keep on coming  where  and when is this madness going to end with this guy 
JnF_By5dbX4,biden makes carter look like a genius       boy were we have been sold out
JnF_By5dbX4,he legit sent 5 million barrels of oil oversees so his son can play oil tycoon
JnF_By5dbX4,well sleepy joe can thank trump for making sure the strategic oil reserves were full smh
JnF_By5dbX4,he has to go it is time congress and senate steps in and puts a stop to this nut
JnF_By5dbX4,he needs to be kicked out of the white house and repay the taxpayers everything that he has stolen and given away
JnF_By5dbX4,food prices are going to double this fall for sure now
JnF_By5dbX4,he knows he can do this since most media wont hold him accountable
JnF_By5dbX4,good thing fox never selectively edits or leaves out key information
JnF_By5dbX4,they arent after me they are after you im just in their way
JnF_By5dbX4,this administration is going to cause a second revolution
JnF_By5dbX4,reserved oil is for in case we go to war  depleting the reserves is a bad bad move 
JnF_By5dbX4,why arent the republicans screaming impeachment at the top of their lungs why havent they been all this time
JnF_By5dbX4,its so nice seeing jim nabors in an interview after all these years
JnF_By5dbX4,he said he would release oil from the strategic reserves he just didnt say it would  be used in the united states this president  is truly unamerican
JnF_By5dbX4,great news it means gasoline prices are going down oil is a global industry china bought the high sulfur content oil that they have refineries for and we dont
JnF_By5dbX4,he thinks american citizens would rather starve and send our money and fuel to foreign third world countries  thats crazy
JnF_By5dbX4,time for an impeachment hearing this is why he and his cronies are worried about the second amendment
JnF_By5dbX4,cant fully blame joe though someone else is pulling the strings
JnF_By5dbX4,i think this would be a better reason to impeach than any they tried on trump
JnF_By5dbX4,everything happening to the country is intentional
JnF_By5dbX4,our countries electric grid infrastructure isnt ready for a majority even a portion of the population to be driving evs

afbPfc9bqi4,the main goal of indian education system is complete the syllabus
afbPfc9bqi4,i think youtube is far better than schools colleges and universities now a days
afbPfc9bqi4,the fact that we wont remember anything after the exams end
afbPfc9bqi4,in india education system is just about maintaing our notebooks hairs polished shoes and not about the real knowledge that must be taught in schools
afbPfc9bqi4,i genuinely regret having my parents spend so much money on these coaching classes because i learnt most of the syllabus online or by myself
afbPfc9bqi4,only 2 things are missing in indias education system
afbPfc9bqi4,i am a victim of this education system literally i cried after watching this couldnt crack any competitive exams
afbPfc9bqi4,the dialogue zindagi jab test leti hai toh subject wise nahi leti from hichaki perfectly depicts the conditions of indian education system
afbPfc9bqi4,education in a nutshell
afbPfc9bqi4,but these issues do not matters for people of india
afbPfc9bqi4,literally that part showing some students  dropping in the boxes of iit  iim  nit and the rest in the dustbin truly hurts
afbPfc9bqi4,the most celebrated achievement in this country is when someone leaves it
afbPfc9bqi4,once you know about finland education system  you cant believe that this country is on our planet
afbPfc9bqi4,when people are celebrating cancellation of exams celebrating lockdown holidays celebrating online exams you knows theres a serious problem with the education system
afbPfc9bqi4,everybody is a genius but if a fish is judged on its ability to climb a tree then it will live the whole life believing its stupid
afbPfc9bqi4,the l in the indian education system stands for learning
afbPfc9bqi4,the scariest part is that we dont know when this failed system will end
afbPfc9bqi4,nobody tell us about carrer choices after we waste 45 years in eng or something we discover many career paths  its funny and sad
afbPfc9bqi4,the factory animation filtering students to the carton boxes was so to the point
afbPfc9bqi4,so i wanna shoutout too on what i have experienced
afbPfc9bqi4,the sad reality of education system is
afbPfc9bqi4,most of the students are pushed to give exams like neet jee without even them knowing it
afbPfc9bqi4,finland has an ideal system we should adopt some techniques from them
afbPfc9bqi4,in my college i was showing my answersheet to someone but i was immediately thrown out of the examination hall
afbPfc9bqi4,i still remember my teacher mr manjunath sir
afbPfc9bqi4,i am still blown away by how indias educational system was designed to destroy india itself
afbPfc9bqi4,education is most important for country to be a developed country 
afbPfc9bqi4,while people will argue for more iits and iims i think indian govt schools need to be made better and results will be far much better
afbPfc9bqi4,you know its very heart breaking when your teacher yourself says 
afbPfc9bqi4,talk about indian education system begins
afbPfc9bqi4,cbse and other english medium students  indian education is too much theoretical and very less practical
afbPfc9bqi4,finally mohak did a video on the education system now my life is complete
afbPfc9bqi4,measked a doubt in my class with all my guts
afbPfc9bqi4,ruby rai has became so immortal that whenever indian education comes her name gets automatically associated
afbPfc9bqi4,everyday mohak comes with different backgrounds
afbPfc9bqi4,what else we can expect from a byhearting education system
afbPfc9bqi4,in india more importance is given to education than the happiness of the people
afbPfc9bqi4,it is kind of a paradox if everyone wants the education system to change why hasnt it changed already
afbPfc9bqi4,its sick you have to be good at biology to take iit
afbPfc9bqi4,indian education system is somehow reason for every problem in india n u cant say me wrong
afbPfc9bqi4,we need to give more space for innovative thinking logical out look and practical approach towards problem solving over grades
afbPfc9bqi4,do what youre passionate of
afbPfc9bqi4,i hope the new education policy gets implemented properly
afbPfc9bqi4,student music is my life i want to make a carrer in music
afbPfc9bqi4,neet giving students  18 lakh
afbPfc9bqi4,indian education system has everything except the education part
afbPfc9bqi4,in todays time its considered to be a sin if were not referring out it to ruby rai while talking about the great
afbPfc9bqi4,this harsh reality of indian education system literally gave me goosebumps
afbPfc9bqi4,we give job to reserved indian
afbPfc9bqi4,really shocked by this videoif this is the case when the kids went to schoolsthen what will be the case during online educationlot of kids dont have smartphone and internet
afbPfc9bqi4,as a bihari id like to say that we have the highest variety of 10th passouts
afbPfc9bqi4,you missed one important factor that could revolutionize the education
afbPfc9bqi4,in indian education system they just get rid of the l in the word learning
afbPfc9bqi4,only investing 3 of gdp on education sector and dreaming to be a literate country happens in our country
afbPfc9bqi4,the youth can also take initiative by being a little self motivated there are 100s of youtube channels teaching everything thats taught in school
afbPfc9bqi4,even cgp grey said that we should categorise children on their learning basis
afbPfc9bqi4,the day we start answering the why questions the education will be effective
afbPfc9bqi4,i think students should learn what they like other than what they are forced to learn
afbPfc9bqi4,govt teachers dont know anything themselves they should give exams for promotions they should brush up the concepts and work on themselves if they need promotions
afbPfc9bqi4,my family has an amazing trend of putting their children in a school better than theirs
afbPfc9bqi4,sad for ruby she just wanted to pass the test but the teacher made her top the exam lol
afbPfc9bqi4,trust me this was much awaited episode for all of the youth
afbPfc9bqi4,we often tend to forget the contents of the previous classes when we get promoted to the succeeding one
afbPfc9bqi4,indian education system  parents pay or take loan and make the schools coaching centers and colleges richer
afbPfc9bqi4,i love the fact that every sentence mohak speaks is well researched and well thought
afbPfc9bqi4,mohak your videos are really really amazing  whyy arent these discussions being done by mainstream media
afbPfc9bqi4,thanks for using your platform for promoting small talented creators ive seen you grow from humble beginnings and youre still by far the my favorite indian content creator

kADKvHW05_I,im with the teacher they didnt learn anything for a week so theyre probably already behind
kADKvHW05_I,better to have a lazy teacher than a bad teacher
kADKvHW05_I,oh we didnt do any of those 
kADKvHW05_I,we didnt do any of the assignments
kADKvHW05_I,its fine everythings fine felt that
kADKvHW05_I,i used to be a sub myself and i must say wow
kADKvHW05_I,the look on your face at what made me guffaw
kADKvHW05_I,i subbed for 3 school years i was an extension of their teacher when i was there sure we joked around some but we always worked
kADKvHW05_I,i love getting free days at school especially during pe it happens a lot so were just on our phones and talking
kADKvHW05_I,this is school im not here to learn im here to go home props to anyone who knows who said that
kADKvHW05_I,actually in some ways im on board with this because we always just got stuck with busywork insane amounts so i do tend to agree
kADKvHW05_I,bro subs were always free days wed all be so mad when they actually enforced the finish the assignment at the end of the class
kADKvHW05_I,im sorry but when i was in schoolwe loved those kinds of subs lol
kADKvHW05_I,the what and slam down papers got me crying
kADKvHW05_I,mrs rogers everythings fine
kADKvHW05_I,id prefer this dude any day of the week when i was in school
kADKvHW05_I,my school has such a bad reputation that  we barely even have subs most of the time its just another teacher
kADKvHW05_I,ill never forget the day my class had a sub for culinary who yelled at a kid for having a snack during class
kADKvHW05_I,the nerve that teacher has to say she is ungrateful when you signed up to teach and didnt do the job
kADKvHW05_I,once my class had a sub and he basically gave us a free day then the next day our teacher told us how disappointed she was in
kADKvHW05_I,sleeping in class and talking to friends in class should be what school is about
kADKvHW05_I,this mrsmith character is kinda like if kyle was a teacher
kADKvHW05_I,subs would hold your assignments hostage while they were telling you their lifes story
kADKvHW05_I,the sub is like the grandparents who look after your kids feed them lots of sugar and caffein then drop them back off at your house
kADKvHW05_I,as going into 7th this year i could use a free day lol
kADKvHW05_I,hey sleeping in class is important
kADKvHW05_I,that would be the best couple days ever lol
kADKvHW05_I,imagine being in that class
kADKvHW05_I,that what was absolutely perfect mrs rodgers perfect response and the tone just made it even better
kADKvHW05_I,i would love that sub especially if phones were allowed
kADKvHW05_I,yes all the work that goes into making sub plans and mr smith didnt even try
kADKvHW05_I,honestly the kids probably appreciated the break from work for a bit but that sub should honestly just leave like now and never come back please
kADKvHW05_I,this is so true my sub gave us a full week of freetime
kADKvHW05_I,my sub had been with us for two weeks and i believe she is going to be a month longer
kADKvHW05_I,i remember these days and they were great for my mental health
kADKvHW05_I,this is why i used to introduce myself to subs with glue on my hands as a kid grrrrrrrrr
kADKvHW05_I,this happens all the time at my school we even had a sub who didnt like our project groups so we did nothing
kADKvHW05_I,i mean sub days were almost always free days when i was in school admittedly that was a few decades ago
kADKvHW05_I,we got that the internet was down so we got to do anything we want
kADKvHW05_I,damn mrs rogers does this really happen
kADKvHW05_I,man i would be grateful if i was a student in that classroom with those free days
kADKvHW05_I,hey there i have a question have you ever had a student with a 504 why im asking cuz i automatically have a 504 and im curious 
kADKvHW05_I,my science teachers name is mr smith and hes awesome lol so it was funny to see this
kADKvHW05_I,i would love if that happened in my class
kADKvHW05_I,and this is how the sub lost their teachers license
kADKvHW05_I,leave the sub alone they already have a tough schedule with unpredicted work life
kADKvHW05_I,reminds me of one of my co workers its infuriating
kADKvHW05_I,loved these subs lmao
kADKvHW05_I,ok is it wrong i wish i had a day with mr smith every once in a while
kADKvHW05_I,this was my issue with subs this year the good ones in my district were all taken for weeks at a time
kADKvHW05_I,every substitute teacher ever why the hell you think wed get excited when there was a substitute teacher we need we didnt have to do s
kADKvHW05_I,you really need a shirt that says dont make me go upside your head
kADKvHW05_I,all the subs back in my school tented to be pretty strict on our assignments when the teachers were out to an annoying point
kADKvHW05_I,i would love to have that sub

xyf-SowRhUQ,hey guys thanks for the million subscribers im so grateful for your support if you want to catch me live i also recommend joining the discord here
xyf-SowRhUQ,i love how is vegeta the blond one doesnt just have a simple yesno answer but if you know nothing about dbz its really hard to explain
xyf-SowRhUQ,i think it would be really cool to see a different interaction of this
xyf-SowRhUQ,the pain that i feel knowing how hard it is to draw quickly and still get the details across this is so impressive
xyf-SowRhUQ,this is glorious chaos and brings me back to the 30 second figure sketch exercises we did in my first semester at college
xyf-SowRhUQ,an animated fx round would be awesome yall could do a handfull of effects for prompts like speed lines electricity energy beams huge possibilities
xyf-SowRhUQ,the more i watch these videos the more convinced i am that juny is the hero of our time
xyf-SowRhUQ,would love a mega cut episode with everyones real time perspective on every drawing it can be 10 plus hours who cares
xyf-SowRhUQ,ive said once ill say it again juny is so freakin talented and so was everyone else so impressive
xyf-SowRhUQ,id honestly love to see people take a single image prompt and submit versions of it every minute then you could see the process playing out at 100x speed
xyf-SowRhUQ,it was an absolute honor to be invited on to draw with such a talented roster  everyone did amazing work especially under the time constraints  
xyf-SowRhUQ,congrats on 1 million man have been watching since you started this channel hope you are doing good we love you
xyf-SowRhUQ,i love how ross is an australian but doesnt know what an echidna looks like
xyf-SowRhUQ,everyone collectively failing pikachus tail is painful and hilarious
xyf-SowRhUQ,also how are people still getting the coloration on pikachus tail wrong he never had black at the end
xyf-SowRhUQ,eggmans mustache was perfect
xyf-SowRhUQ,the real pro move here is having the creativity to keep milking this game after so many videos and still make it look interesting
xyf-SowRhUQ,juny terrifies me sometimes with how good he is so quickly
xyf-SowRhUQ,do echidnas have long ant eating snouts no that an anteater big brain train of thought
xyf-SowRhUQ,hey ross me and my friends have been inspired by your challenges and we made a new one drawing thingscharacters as anime women it can get very cursed very fast
xyf-SowRhUQ,as someone who doesnt know most of the characters  memes from this video i agree not for anything specific just agree
xyf-SowRhUQ,congratulations on 1 million subscribers ross you finally did it
xyf-SowRhUQ,suggestion time make the lesser know brothersister of famous characters
xyf-SowRhUQ,its been a while since i watched one of these
xyf-SowRhUQ,i love these videos always makes me laugh
xyf-SowRhUQ,theres some great talent here gg to everyone
xyf-SowRhUQ,for eggman it wouldve been great if someone did jim carreys eggmandr robotnik
xyf-SowRhUQ,i have yet to be convinced that juny is not a robot no human can draw in such detail in such short time
xyf-SowRhUQ,congrats for the million subs ross this was also a great vid
xyf-SowRhUQ,someone else acknowledged the mandela effect pikachu that everyone seems to be drawing
xyf-SowRhUQ,how is juny this good in such a short amount of time
xyf-SowRhUQ,its not caillou you bitch is a great ross quote for the ages
xyf-SowRhUQ,asking if vegeta was the blonde one was like asking if hes the one that fights
xyf-SowRhUQ,im honestly surprised there werent more people that drew pikachu with the black tail tip that he doesnt actually have
xyf-SowRhUQ,yay drawing from memory my favorite type of drawing
xyf-SowRhUQ,i never knew art could break the sound barrier
xyf-SowRhUQ,i love how everyone did imprecively fine
xyf-SowRhUQ,paper mario showed that we got some true geniuses in here
xyf-SowRhUQ,love watching these as im relaxing before bed
xyf-SowRhUQ,ayy big w for that franky justice love to see it hes criminally underrated
xyf-SowRhUQ,you should do animations with your speed run arts
xyf-SowRhUQ,rubberross in every intro for no reason it really really helps out
xyf-SowRhUQ,finally someone agrees franky is the best strawhat thank you for the vindication
xyf-SowRhUQ,ross is absolutely correct half the time spent drawing even in a normal drawing for me is just screeching and unintelligible noises
xyf-SowRhUQ,will we ever get a full series yall design
xyf-SowRhUQ,this was a lot of fun
xyf-SowRhUQ,i was gonna say man i love rubberross videos before i clicked on this video and accidentally said man i love bob ross videos
xyf-SowRhUQ,funny thing is these speed drawings are still better than anything i could make in hours you guys are very talented in both art and video making keep it up
xyf-SowRhUQ,ross said wow in this video more than owen wilson in his whole career
xyf-SowRhUQ,what does an echidna look like says the australian man
xyf-SowRhUQ,i mustve been living under a rock because i know only 910 of these characters
xyf-SowRhUQ,idea turning thing into cute girls youve had lavendertowne on before thats a series of hers it could be question mode
xyf-SowRhUQ,never thought id see sir in one of these thats a very pleasant surprise
xyf-SowRhUQ,to answer the question of does an echidna have a long snout or not there are echidnas with long snouts and ones with short snouts
xyf-SowRhUQ,dont have a cow kakarrot fucking
xyf-SowRhUQ,i saw junys drawing of tifa and unironically went is that ena
xyf-SowRhUQ,id love to see thistry not to laugh
xyf-SowRhUQ,whoever made sure to put the ads in between albums i see and appreciate you
xyf-SowRhUQ,i always love this gang so much
xyf-SowRhUQ,speaking of the fxofffx animation challenge you mentioned is there way you could play a game of animator clash in gartic
xyf-SowRhUQ,1 mil subs congrats ross
xyf-SowRhUQ,is vegeta the blonde one
xyf-SowRhUQ,the only appropriate response to is vegeta the blond one is sometimes
xyf-SowRhUQ,i am convinced juny does these so much so he can flex on all these people p
xyf-SowRhUQ,im mad that during the entire chopper round i didnt see the astromech chopper
xyf-SowRhUQ,i mean frankie after the timeskip is very difficult to get used to imo
xyf-SowRhUQ,i cant wait for artists speedrun carpal tunnel
xyf-SowRhUQ,oh hey hows my way of living so far fun isint it it totally isnt tedious or anything speedrunning art trying to keep a deadline laughs
xyf-SowRhUQ,absolutely amazing lmao
xyf-SowRhUQ,i always pop off when you drop a video great content 
xyf-SowRhUQ,im expecting a single dash on paper to be called art here
xyf-SowRhUQ,honestly kinda disappointed no one drew zelda instead of link
xyf-SowRhUQ,im surprised nobody drew an uganda knuckles during the knuckles promt
xyf-SowRhUQ,ross you should do favorite anime character but in different types of different anime styles like
xyf-SowRhUQ,i miss choppers original design so sad that one piece will end without chopper being redeemed
xyf-SowRhUQ,shoutout to winstonchayc in the twitch chat for coming up with snuffleknucklegusi am so glad i saw that one
xyf-SowRhUQ,in all these gartic videos why does it feel like juny has 3x the amount of time as everyone else
xyf-SowRhUQ,1m subs less go congrats you deserve it
xyf-SowRhUQ,everyone when they draw pikachu
xyf-SowRhUQ,im sad no one drew the ok panel of saitama
xyf-SowRhUQ,the fact that no one drew hunters palisman from owl house for the flapjack prompt disappoints me
xyf-SowRhUQ,gartic phone suggestion based off a weird name someone made draw an original character
xyf-SowRhUQ,it makes me feel insane when i see people draw pikachu with a black tip on his tail
xyf-SowRhUQ,pain in its true form  new sub
xyf-SowRhUQ,sir was on point
xyf-SowRhUQ,you always know when knuckles is here hes gonna be bringing is legoforces
xyf-SowRhUQ,can you make an episode where you get a promt like eggman and then you draw  so the prompt is two emojis

R-s_dO7Snx0,how to outperform the stock market read thousands of annual reports learn about margin of safety  buy undervalued stocks  insider information and seek professional help
R-s_dO7Snx0,thanks for everything you do jim
R-s_dO7Snx0,every time cramer speaks it lowers the barometer of intelligent thoughts of investment i have accumulated over the years
R-s_dO7Snx0,i pretty much understand half of what this man is saying but hes ok 
R-s_dO7Snx0,anyone notice he goes from articulate to unintelligible back and forth  its hilarious i go from recognizing his words  to having no idea what group of words he just said
R-s_dO7Snx0,im with crametnow is the time to buy tech stocks are probably near the bottom shortterm
R-s_dO7Snx0,despite the economic downturnim so happy
R-s_dO7Snx0,cramer says tech is the way to go but he also bashes arkk every chance he gets wassup with that
R-s_dO7Snx0,crazy how the narrative does a 180 in the space of a couple weeks
R-s_dO7Snx0,sell the bounce especially tech stocks
R-s_dO7Snx0,short  sell every stock he buys  like go long  buy every stock he sells or dont like
R-s_dO7Snx0,amd and nvidia dont make their own chips they contract that out to other fabs
R-s_dO7Snx0,and here we have monday morning quarterback jim cramer taking financial advice from this bald bozo is worse than flipping a coin
R-s_dO7Snx0,lets go jimmy load the bus
R-s_dO7Snx0,amd is a beast dont bet against tech
R-s_dO7Snx0,lol not giving up tech stock good luck i bet we are only half way down
R-s_dO7Snx0,you said their multiple is way too high going into a recession
R-s_dO7Snx0,good show this is jim at his best
R-s_dO7Snx0,guys sell i promise you jimm is trying to say that 
R-s_dO7Snx0,we love you jim but dont talk out of both sides of your mouth
R-s_dO7Snx0,cramer businesses doubled and triple orderedthis will effect semi
R-s_dO7Snx0,a war of psychotic intent
R-s_dO7Snx0,this is brave after a 4 day rally
R-s_dO7Snx0,someone must study cramer timing
R-s_dO7Snx0,amd used to be a 3 stock 2000
R-s_dO7Snx0,this is like march pump when fed let market ease
R-s_dO7Snx0,bustard last year he was pumping them to all time highs
R-s_dO7Snx0,inverse cramer says sell techs
R-s_dO7Snx0,im not here to make friends im here to help you lose all your money 
R-s_dO7Snx0,why does he speak like hes 10 beers deep
R-s_dO7Snx0,tech stock rally confirmed
R-s_dO7Snx0,thanks for the short signal
R-s_dO7Snx0,time to sell tech stocks
R-s_dO7Snx0,cramer  contradiction
R-s_dO7Snx0,this guy has less clue than 15 year olds with a podcast
R-s_dO7Snx0,tech about to dump got it
R-s_dO7Snx0,fed basically told you 10yr not going above 3
R-s_dO7Snx0,yet  nasdaq down over 30  might as well ride it out from here
R-s_dO7Snx0,even with the current dip in crypto currencys im glad i can smile
R-s_dO7Snx0,puts on tech stocks
R-s_dO7Snx0,i think hes calling the bottom here
R-s_dO7Snx0,short tech stocks
R-s_dO7Snx0,bitcoin up 8 today
R-s_dO7Snx0,please jim you are overdue for a correction just go home and retire
R-s_dO7Snx0,whats up with yatsen stocks going to the moon and no you tubers are talking about it
R-s_dO7Snx0,the guy the is a legend of being always wrong 
R-s_dO7Snx0,reverse cramer is always right 
R-s_dO7Snx0,damn tech stocks are doomed
R-s_dO7Snx0,hmm sound like cathy woods keeper up 
R-s_dO7Snx0,nice puts on tech and cathy woods
R-s_dO7Snx0,man makes no sense ever
R-s_dO7Snx0,why this clown is not telling everyone to buy bitcoin beats me

eLeYCwv0j9Q,i always find it funnyconfusing that what essentially looks like a burger patty is referred to as a sausage at mcdonalds in the us
eLeYCwv0j9Q,whenever i want to eat something healthy i go to mcdonalds thank you for improving our health on a daily basis
Xk4zTcQpGqo,food theory idea what is theoretically the highest you can stack a pancake and what strategies can you do to prevent them from falling
Xk4zTcQpGqo,im absolutely
Xk4zTcQpGqo,as a missourian a while back my friends and i decided that when were elderly well break into the cheese cave and make it our retirement home
Xk4zTcQpGqo,im starting to think about 70 of the reasoning behind every food theory topic is dependent on how many dad jokes matpat can make within the span of the video
Xk4zTcQpGqo,i swear matpats alliteration skills are on point and getting better and better
Xk4zTcQpGqo,idea for theory  would a person survive by just taking pills with necessary amount of vitamins and minerals that the body needs 
Xk4zTcQpGqo,as someone who grew up in missouri i remember hearing about the cheese cave jokes that it was full of government cheese i guess it was true
Xk4zTcQpGqo,if someone wanted the cheese how would they go about getting it asking for a friend
Xk4zTcQpGqo,i like watching food theory there is often a lesson that feels applicable to real life
Xk4zTcQpGqo,finally i have been waiting for someone to cover this i learned about
Xk4zTcQpGqo,food theory ideahow much cheese would it take to build an artificial cheese moon and also how much would it cost
Xk4zTcQpGqo,i swear this guy can make a theory about anything and make it sound believable great work mat pat
Xk4zTcQpGqo,im 41 now and definitely remember getting government cheese as a kid my friends and i still bring it up sometimes that it wasnt that bad
Xk4zTcQpGqo,hey matpat i have a pretty good question what and how far can a piece of gum be stretched i wanna see your take on this
Xk4zTcQpGqo,im willing to be on the front lines if my fellow turophiles want to storm and raid this cave together
Xk4zTcQpGqo,i already knew about this but its still irritating to see the unintended consequences of stupid government plans and policies
Xk4zTcQpGqo,how many cheese puns do you want
Xk4zTcQpGqo,its amazing the logical things that can get twisted into conspiracy theories so easily when we dont have all the information
Xk4zTcQpGqo,theory idea what is the fewest amount of chips needed for a pringles circle
Xk4zTcQpGqo,love this channel ive wondered this for literally years but never cared enough to search why in comes the food theorists
Xk4zTcQpGqo,those who dont learn from history are doomed to eat cheese
Xk4zTcQpGqo,i was skeptical at first about how many theories on food there could be to sustain a channel  but after this video i realized there is a cornucopia of theories
Xk4zTcQpGqo,as a missourian i can safely say that i am not surprised at all im fairly certain that theres a heck of a lot more than cheese in missouris caves
Xk4zTcQpGqo,wow i was not expecting to enjoy this episode as much as i did i mean i always enjoy all of these channels but this was a fantastic episode
Xk4zTcQpGqo,ive been to the caves in springfield   its actually pretty neat  you take the entire semi truck inside and they are enormous
Xk4zTcQpGqo,but thats just a theory a conspiracy theory
Xk4zTcQpGqo,i learned all of the true history of this story a long while ago from a tumblr post neat to see it on food theory too
Xk4zTcQpGqo,yo government cheese used to be something i looked forward to as a kid i literally thought it was the best kind of cheese
Xk4zTcQpGqo,just imagine seeing all those piles of cheese stacked before you what a crazy sight
Xk4zTcQpGqo,man i was really hoping the government was actually hiding a giant cheese monster in a cave in springfield missouri
Xk4zTcQpGqo,the cheese cave has got to be heaven for remy from ratatouille
Xk4zTcQpGqo,i would love to see a theory behind an apple a day keeps the doctor away or which type of apple would be best to do so
Xk4zTcQpGqo,my friends were interested due to potassium could you blow up a building with moist bananas and if so how many
Xk4zTcQpGqo,those who dont learn from history are apparently doomed to eat cheese im gonna use that forever
Xk4zTcQpGqo,as a cheese enthusiast id love to have that cheese in my house
Xk4zTcQpGqo,i remember my grandma getting that cheese back in the day and it made a really good grilled cheese sandwich
Xk4zTcQpGqo,im extremely impressed at your ability to make things interesting wish you were my teacher growing up
Xk4zTcQpGqo,as a missourian i didnt know why we kept millions of pounds of cheese in caves  thanks mattpat
Xk4zTcQpGqo,just when you think matpats ran out of ideas he always seems to have cool but kind of weird theory
Xk4zTcQpGqo,the article was posted on february but the theory is in july
Xk4zTcQpGqo,best thing the government has done in my lifetimestill dont understand why they have to run a quarter trillion dollar annual budget deficit though cheese aint that expensive
Xk4zTcQpGqo,the phrase government owned cheese is absolutely hilarious to me
Xk4zTcQpGqo,i swear every time i see that he posts i say to myselfwhat true but utterly shocking news am i going to learn today
Xk4zTcQpGqo,if matpat has taught us anything over these years on every channel its that those who dont pay attention to the past are doomed to eat cheese
Xk4zTcQpGqo,watching food theory almost never fails to make me hungry d
Xk4zTcQpGqo,i dont know matpat why does the government have 14 billion pounds of cheese
Xk4zTcQpGqo,imagin if the government paid matpat to say all this and the truth is something top secret xd
Xk4zTcQpGqo,i love how matpats just giving us random facts that we can use in conversations to show how smart we are to people who think were not
Xk4zTcQpGqo,i love your work matpat youre awesome

JFDpO42lcaY,forfeit redo the challenge until you complete it it would be a good achievement
JFDpO42lcaY,an interesting forfeit would be having the render distance to the lowest possible setting for hardly any visibility or the highest setting so it has lag spike fairly frequently
JFDpO42lcaY,a great forfeit would be a manhunt where the hunters can turn invisible even with armor and gear equipped
JFDpO42lcaY,they should do the same challenge again but they share health
JFDpO42lcaY,a great forfeit would be both kier and dev as speedrunners and one hunter with a torture device
JFDpO42lcaY,a great forfeit would be finding the diamond piramid for real
JFDpO42lcaY,a good forfeit would be to let kier have three of the most overpowered twists they had
JFDpO42lcaY,this was truly incredible i truly do enjoy seeing my favorite youtubers screaming in agony
JFDpO42lcaY,forfeit beat minecraft with linked health without dying once d
JFDpO42lcaY,let boosfer combine all off his torture plugins and use it in a manhunt also make kier and dev be the only hunters
JFDpO42lcaY,well i would love to see them do another manhunt but we make our own twist
JFDpO42lcaY,a great forfeit would be kier and dev hunt boosfer but have to eat a spoon of hot sauce every time they die
JFDpO42lcaY,do this again but with everyone you record with and see who lasts the longest
JFDpO42lcaY,i dont have any forfeit ideas im just here to say respect to kier for doing so good and going at it alone for the most part
JFDpO42lcaY,a good forfeit would be if they could not move with wasd and could only move by getting hit back by mobs or minecarts and rails
JFDpO42lcaY,forfeit idea you have to beat the game in a deep dark only world
JFDpO42lcaY,a great forfeit would be a black hole manhunt like the challenge video that dream attempted
JFDpO42lcaY,a great forfeit would be to let everyone kier  dev yellowwool  boosfer and bubbo try to beat the game but on fundys difficulty
JFDpO42lcaY,as a forfeit how about a manhunt but in vr i think it could be interesting
JFDpO42lcaY,kier  kill all the animals you see
JFDpO42lcaY,forfeit challenge hunter can bend the 4 elements whilst kier and dev speedrun
JFDpO42lcaY,i love how half of their deaths were selfsabotage
JFDpO42lcaY,a great forfeit would be a manhunt with us were the hunters and youre the hunters this would be so much fun
JFDpO42lcaY,the montage of kier and dev screaming as their attempts fail is funny
JFDpO42lcaY,why do we make the entire squad attempt this challenge together imagine the chaos
JFDpO42lcaY,a great forfeit would be both keir and dev are speed runners and boosfer have every thing that has tortured you two so far
JFDpO42lcaY,a good forfeit would be to let them do the honey block parcour map without deaths
JFDpO42lcaY,one hand they have to beat the game while only using one hand to control their character
JFDpO42lcaY,the best kier and dev vid ive seen so far good job
JFDpO42lcaY,a great forfeit would be to have to make boosfer make a plugin to when he crouches you go into adventure mode
JFDpO42lcaY,as a forfeit you should do minecraft but you can breathe water instead of air
JFDpO42lcaY,wow i never knew dev would actually agree to doing this again
JFDpO42lcaY,its great seeing you guys work together 
JFDpO42lcaY,i thought after boosfer yellowool and kiers torture twists youd make sure that this would never happen
JFDpO42lcaY,i think every twist that makes the game more difficult combined would be an incredible forfeit
JFDpO42lcaY,forfeit kier and dev do an all advancements run where they both get all of the advancements
JFDpO42lcaY,i think only kier can win the challenge bc everytime when dev joins it changes the game
JFDpO42lcaY,bring everyone together and have one guy have a torture device while you guys try to beat the game
JFDpO42lcaY,thanks for the amazing content
JFDpO42lcaY,forfeit idea
JFDpO42lcaY,i love seeing them just fail over and over again and seeing all the attempts they tried props for doing it
JFDpO42lcaY,i would suggest kier and dev as hunters against 100 speedrunners without twists easy rule kill them all before they kill the dragon if you can
JFDpO42lcaY,a great forfeit would be to make your avatars as your real face and its a manhunt where every time you kill the hunters you will get op items
JFDpO42lcaY,i feel like doing this datapack was enough pain already xd
JFDpO42lcaY,forfeit idea the two of you beat the game but a random effect from the torture video happens every 30 seconds
JFDpO42lcaY,seems interesting if you two become speedrunners who compete with each other and the hunters who will chase you to the end
JFDpO42lcaY,i got a good forfeit idea
JFDpO42lcaY,a great forfeit is they have to beat the game while the game tries to kill them every 60 seconds without dying
JFDpO42lcaY,i think they should give the hunter any twist for the forfeit
JFDpO42lcaY,a good forfeit would be they invite a fan to be one of the hunters and they have an opportunity twist and the others have no twist
JFDpO42lcaY,a great forfeit would be if yall made yalls on twist again but created how many lives yall both get
JFDpO42lcaY,for a forfeit you can do minecraft manhunt where kier and dev speedrunners cant use armor nor weapons where as boosfer and yellow hunters get op loot throughout the manhunt
JFDpO42lcaY,as a forfeit you should be able so neither the hunter or the speedrunner can touch the ground
JFDpO42lcaY,a good forfeit would be every 60 seconds the twist changes but its only the torture ones
JFDpO42lcaY,an amazing forfeit would be to beat the world record longest minecraft speed run which is about 124 hours
JFDpO42lcaY,a good forfeit would be to beat the game in adventure mode
JFDpO42lcaY,why do i feel like at that last attempt kier is having progress until dev joined and the random chaos got hard to the extreme
JFDpO42lcaY,if they forfit they can do the deep dark explore with inverted mouse setting and with the highest sensitivity as well
JFDpO42lcaY,a great forfeit is probrably to do controlling different elements like lava and stone
JFDpO42lcaY,forfeit get the dream team to do a manhunt but theyre the hunters and youre the speedrunners
JFDpO42lcaY,well kier clearly didnt want to win this for the first day but he redeemed himself with the third
JFDpO42lcaY,a good forfeit for kier and dev would be minecraft but everything they look at becomes lava with the goal being to get diamonds
JFDpO42lcaY,i would love to see the race each other to see who best the game first
JFDpO42lcaY,a good forfeit make the game run at a constant 1fps
JFDpO42lcaY,minecraft manhunt but everyone has a different gravity and its randomly chosen at the start
JFDpO42lcaY,i think the funniest thing to watch would be them attempting to beat minecraft in vr with half heart in hardcore
JFDpO42lcaY,a good forfeit could be a manhunt but with a really hard modpack and with this mod as well
JFDpO42lcaY,a good forfeit would be to do this again in vr
JFDpO42lcaY,forfeit redo the challenge but you share a health bar inventory and hunger bar
JFDpO42lcaY,i was waiting eagerly for the torture series it finally came yay 
JFDpO42lcaY,a good forfeit would be making kier be a speed runner in a slightly more tame version of this
JFDpO42lcaY,forfeit for maximum pain would be a manhunt in this plugin except the hunters are immune to it

6sAu7CDwLiU,although i want to i will not be calling customer support just to talk to this wholesome person
6sAu7CDwLiU,so jamie worked for best buy wall mounting tvs for 4 years and gets a sweet gig at ltt mounting tvs
6sAu7CDwLiU,this is the guy we all needed a chaotic evil character jokes aside nolan could probably do some tech news
6sAu7CDwLiU,linus is a perfect choice for a case study in designing protective packaging
6sAu7CDwLiU,jokes about nolan not being a fan favourite but his banter is great and i am loving how much hes chatting back to linus haha
6sAu7CDwLiU,nolan helped me out with my water bottle order a while ago best customer service ive ever interacted with nolans the man
6sAu7CDwLiU,im so jealous at 21 i had a two generation old game console and a non hd tv freaking epic set up
6sAu7CDwLiU,this was weirdly one of my favorite episodes
6sAu7CDwLiU,its crazy to think nolan is only 21 the man is living the life most people dream of hes clearly been playing all his cards right mad props to him
6sAu7CDwLiU,i like nolan he has a bright personality also i absolutely envy his storage setup its completely ridiculous but good thing its intels money this was funny
6sAu7CDwLiU,i just really love meeting the staff at lmg through these videos its great to see the longtime employees but seeing your more recent hires is great content
6sAu7CDwLiU,it always makes me happy to see how lmg employees can find creative new ways to waste intels money
6sAu7CDwLiU,this is the last install of the day how about i put it there and you like it  now we know why nolan is customer care and jamie is not
6sAu7CDwLiU,intel extreme tech upgrades always make me feel warm and bubbly its like christmas but on the internet and i dont keep the presents
6sAu7CDwLiU,you know every single one of linus employees that have been in the upgrades always have nice places def pays them well and that makes me feel good
6sAu7CDwLiU,i always look forward to every tech upgrade always interesting to see what tech people are into my favourite series on youtube
6sAu7CDwLiU,this really put a new meaning in
6sAu7CDwLiU,his setup is amazing i really like the positioning of everything in the room
6sAu7CDwLiU,imagine being so good at your job that your boss never needs to talk to you
6sAu7CDwLiU,wow just talked to nolan over a support ticket interaction was great there looks like interaction was great in this video too
6sAu7CDwLiU,this series is just genius make your staff happy and make good ass content at the same time id watch these forever
6sAu7CDwLiU,once youre done with all the upgrades for your workers will you just start all over again i love these videos
6sAu7CDwLiU,another good upgrade vid nolan was awesome bring him in more on vids cant wait to see the next upgrades
6sAu7CDwLiU,im kinda mad he got all the good stuff x2
6sAu7CDwLiU,i love these videos because i feel like i can get to know the team better by the way anthony is totally my favorite team member
6sAu7CDwLiU,you are so nice to do this for your employees and make content out of it linus
6sAu7CDwLiU,i love that jamie has come out as a favorite once again on nolans video last install of the day how about i put it there and you like it
6sAu7CDwLiU,this guy is really really cool and i feel like linus actually has some chemistry with him  cant say the same with many other employees
6sAu7CDwLiU,dang this series is indeed the best series for everyone for brand for the channel for the employee and for viewers
6sAu7CDwLiU,i just love watching linus build a 10000 pc and unbox a 1000000 server while im just here watching on my nongaming 2017 laptop
6sAu7CDwLiU,them smashing that graphics card into the smaller case has to be one of the funniest things ive seen on this channel haha
6sAu7CDwLiU,switching from a 1988vintage power supply to a 2011vintage power supply would eliminate about 200w 1000w  80 of heat generated just by the power supply
6sAu7CDwLiU,loved this episode d
6sAu7CDwLiU,linus this attention to detail in where the dust is is why i would totally hire you to paint if you were doing that instead valuable trait
6sAu7CDwLiU,we want linuss own 5000 extreme upgrade so we can see how he spends it
6sAu7CDwLiU,intel we want to do an extended sponsor series where we give all your employees a 5000 upgrade
6sAu7CDwLiU,holy shit hes about my age doing pretty good for himself too keep winning king
6sAu7CDwLiU,i have to say this one is for sure is on the top of intel the tech upgrade list guy got everything right and done beatifully
6sAu7CDwLiU,editors when editing linus home vlogs blur out every reflection and window even the smallest one showing a bush outside
6sAu7CDwLiU,this guy is too good in front of a camera and he builds his own computers linus bro give the guy a promotion hes got the mojo
6sAu7CDwLiU,linus thinks that nolan has the godtier setup because he does he has multiple 30series cards currentgen consoles multiple pcs
6sAu7CDwLiU,i love that fractal design case ive built four of them and plan to build many more
6sAu7CDwLiU,i would love to be the first ltt employee to use my alloted intel upgrade funds to build an amdryzen system
6sAu7CDwLiU,man i missed this kind of tutorials lol great work here thanks
6sAu7CDwLiU,linus would be great at military room inspections
6sAu7CDwLiU,honestly i live for this series
6sAu7CDwLiU,imagine your ceo coming to your home commenting everything you own and made and leaving you with 5000 of gifts
6sAu7CDwLiU,oh my god the invisible life of addie
6sAu7CDwLiU,i am surprised intel even allowed this since you know consoles are all amdrunning 
6sAu7CDwLiU,when dennis talked about wanting to flex i feel like nolan heard that and went genius why dont i do that
6sAu7CDwLiU,i wish i could get a intel extreme tech upgrade my computer cant keep up with modern game specs
6sAu7CDwLiU,this guy is awesome no wonder you put him in charge of making sure people are ok
6sAu7CDwLiU,my favourite series of all time  intel extreme tech upgrade
6sAu7CDwLiU,im yet to see a ltt staff member go for an actual good cpu most ive seen is i7s its getting kinda odd
6sAu7CDwLiU,nolan is a mood lol i too have a lack of proper furniture but keep buying tech tho im not really at that level yet  due to lack of finances
6sAu7CDwLiU,got to say that this upgrade is probably the most  reasonable at least for me
6sAu7CDwLiU,nolan helped me when i ordered the wrong sized deskpad and fixed my order just before they all went out of stock he deserves every penny of intels money
6sAu7CDwLiU,ive been watching ltt for some drastically long time and have no clue linus company does is it tech tips or something more direct also sick extreme intel upgrade video
6sAu7CDwLiU,imagine how the image of lmg would be if theyd used ryzen in this systen
6sAu7CDwLiU,this setup is so unhinged and over the top i love it
6sAu7CDwLiU,theres something so hilarious about the fact that a guy just sent an email asking about the transparent tv and just went cool before going silent
6sAu7CDwLiU,id take that tv for 600 just for the novelty of it
6sAu7CDwLiU,i love the spirit got three consoles and two pcs but is holding up is couch with a couple wooden signs this man does definitely know his priorities
6sAu7CDwLiU,linus is awesome what other company is going to upgrade your home computer system just cause
6sAu7CDwLiU,needless to say a medkit will be standard on all expeditions for lmg
6sAu7CDwLiU,nolan seems like a genuinely awesome person he is very nice and down to earthreally cool to see him get screen time
6sAu7CDwLiU,yo that new intro was sick props to whoever animated it
o58OJJT37Nk,ignaz semmelweis was the physician who discovered the hand washing correlation just want to give him credit heartbreaking story no one believed him
o58OJJT37Nk,that why i am nothing that why you put me in a nothing place because i am someone that should wait for you or die trying this is the feeling
o58OJJT37Nk,with the bagel story id probably be the guy saying the line is too long assuming it was actually long time is more valuable than a free bagel

AtomgXPDKnI,its official little league teams have more accountability than whole police depts
AtomgXPDKnI,i ran into coaches like that when i reffed soccer
AtomgXPDKnI,disgusting behavior i can only imagine how he treats the public 
AtomgXPDKnI,i hope this is seen by more people we should be calling his station to ensure something is done
AtomgXPDKnI,once a bully always a bully
AtomgXPDKnI,back in the 50s my grandfather father and uncle built 2 houses across
AtomgXPDKnI,if he does that with kids you can only guess as to what he does to adults out on duty
AtomgXPDKnI,rick hit it on the head with this one this guy has anger issues that will show up again
AtomgXPDKnI,discussing disturbing and uncalled for shameful
AtomgXPDKnI,well maybe they were resisting
AtomgXPDKnI,its called a napoleon complex  the person feels inadequate or insecure about something and overcompensates for it with overbearing behaviour and aggression towards others
AtomgXPDKnI,what a disgrace that is child abuse
AtomgXPDKnI,cant imagine how he is with his own kid or kids
AtomgXPDKnI,this is what qualified immunity leads too
AtomgXPDKnI,good morning rick
AtomgXPDKnI,waitthat guy just inflicted pain on a lot of kidsthats child abusehe needs prisonand that dude behind that creep watched it and did nothing
AtomgXPDKnI,this sgt kenny is a punk if a guy is going to smack kids at a ballgame just imagine what he does on duty
AtomgXPDKnI,teach them young
AtomgXPDKnI,if he treats kids like that i wonder how many lives he has unjustly disrupted or just flat out destroyed
AtomgXPDKnI,i dont know what it is with youth sports coaches and parents theres just some character flaw that seems to manifest itself in that setting
AtomgXPDKnI,i googled why are bald men bullies and there seems to be a issue with the loss of hair  that sgt is a piece of crap
AtomgXPDKnI,what a terrible guy im glad i never had a coach that ever did that seemed to be displaying i think not
AtomgXPDKnI,rick never fails never fails never fails never fails never fails never fails never fails never fails never fails
AtomgXPDKnI,call the police station and make complaints everyone needs to do this now
AtomgXPDKnI,can we call the mayor and ask him to be held accountable
AtomgXPDKnI,give us an update on uvalde rick theres new footage of heroes in the school
AtomgXPDKnI,child sports are all like that around the world
AtomgXPDKnI,hes a great husbandhe always opens the door for his wife as shes running from his beatings great fatherhe always gets them a treat after a beating
AtomgXPDKnI,and in other avenues they wont tolerate this behavior but im sure the department would stick up for his actions
AtomgXPDKnI,the parents should give this guy a blanket party
AtomgXPDKnI,this is about 10 counts of child abuse
AtomgXPDKnI,i got choked out by my high school resource officer in 92 for picking up my girlfriend for lunch after i graduated and she was still a senior
AtomgXPDKnI,a good example of unsportsmanlike conduct  bald bully
AtomgXPDKnI,im deducing that his fellow coaches are also cops seeing as upon witnessing the behaviour immediately put a stop to it
AtomgXPDKnI,harris county has an independent police review board i wonder if anyone has brought this to their attention or if they just asked the police to investigate
AtomgXPDKnI,that was my pos badge carrying father he was real tough when he was screaming  beating a child but a total coward against any other adult
AtomgXPDKnI,there are bad apples in every walk of life glad to see this one gone
AtomgXPDKnI,omg  im a peaceful person but please let me meet this guy one day
AtomgXPDKnI,i remember growing up as a child i revered the police what the fk happened
AtomgXPDKnI,i really dont like bullies never have never will
AtomgXPDKnI,rick i just watched the video release from uvalde i found myself yelling at the tv my god i counted at least 6 law enforcement with ars no excuses none
AtomgXPDKnI,dang rick you are up late
AtomgXPDKnI,poor sportsmanship well thats a nice way of putting it what a punk
AtomgXPDKnI,clearly self defense case closed
AtomgXPDKnI,he can resign from precinct 5 and get a new job in uvalde tx  i hear they are looking for a new chief
AtomgXPDKnI,sad the little league organization has higher standards than the police department
AtomgXPDKnI,what a pos
AtomgXPDKnI,how about the wv trooper slapping the guy in his own house because he raised his voice
AtomgXPDKnI,back the blue till you spend two years in court for pissing off a cop
AtomgXPDKnI,the bar is set very low for cops  most decent ones are retired or 6 feet under by now
AtomgXPDKnI,yeah its the first time that hes been caught a bully and a coward
AtomgXPDKnI,get em rick
AtomgXPDKnI,ahhh the good ole little league days
AtomgXPDKnI,i watched this for a second time and it gets me angrier each time violent child abuser as a sargent
AtomgXPDKnI,im sure his wife says hes a saint while sporting a fresh shiner that she got playing baseball that she doesnt play
AtomgXPDKnI,rick i referee and coach in florida things got so bad in florida that we now ban parents from attending practices
AtomgXPDKnI,he can have a bad day all he wants but dont take it out on kids your suppose to be a role model not a complete jerk
AtomgXPDKnI,great husband and father
AtomgXPDKnI,rick picking on bald cops againlol
AtomgXPDKnI,rick back in our time many adults would say kids need to toughen up
AtomgXPDKnI,hell undoubtedly keep failing up
AtomgXPDKnI,imagine when he has to police black and brown citizens
AtomgXPDKnI,cops seem to think they have unlimited immunity
AtomgXPDKnI,i love how much you hate cops today rick if more were like you when you served i wouldnt hate cops you serve the people they serve themselves
AtomgXPDKnI,ill help with the investigation
AtomgXPDKnI,relieved of duty pending the outcome of an investigation
AtomgXPDKnI,wow so hes a sore loser if hes like this out of uniform imagine what hell be like in uniform
AtomgXPDKnI,sir you are awesome
AtomgXPDKnI,he is a great father and coach shut up rick  hes great even his victims tell you he is
AtomgXPDKnI, back the blue till it happens to you 
AtomgXPDKnI,this cop went to the pelosi school of child interaction

VuNIsY6JdUw,for anybody who doesnt know taylor was just supercute
VuNIsY6JdUw,i sang this song from taylor swift to some students that i interacted with 12 years ago when i volunteered at my former elementary
VuNIsY6JdUw,13 years later this song is this iconic
VuNIsY6JdUw,this song is so great mix of pop and country
VuNIsY6JdUw,it is not a old songits old memories
VuNIsY6JdUw,this is probably my favorite music video
VuNIsY6JdUw,i would never get over with this song
VuNIsY6JdUw,soy el nico que sigue escuchando esta hermosura no me dejen as
VuNIsY6JdUw,this isnt just middle school this is your entire adolescence
VuNIsY6JdUw,this song is 13 years old  my childhood
VuNIsY6JdUw,13 years later you realize the girl he dumped is also taylor swift
VuNIsY6JdUw,13 yrs later still vibing to this
VuNIsY6JdUw,just few more days to go then
VuNIsY6JdUw,taylor being jealous of taylor is the most iconic thing ever
VuNIsY6JdUw,taylor 11 years ago singing for a crush
VuNIsY6JdUw,kinda breaks my heart that this was 13 years ago already this feels like a core memory for me
VuNIsY6JdUw,13 years and this song still slaps
VuNIsY6JdUw,a swiftie fan since im 10 and im now 17 stand tall my queen
VuNIsY6JdUw,never gets old
VuNIsY6JdUw,crush accidentally touches hand

2XL61p2E7lw,i swear chelsea have signed this guy like 3 times now
2XL61p2E7lw,thanks for everything raheemplayed such a big part in our success over many years all the best at chelsea
2XL61p2E7lw,cant wait to see him playing for us welcome raheem
2XL61p2E7lw,i pity unitedall the teams that finished above them are making some very good signing while they are busy doing nothing
2XL61p2E7lw,people questioning sterling ability look at his form for england also he carried england to final of euro 2021
2XL61p2E7lw,looking forward to seeing him play for chelsea
2XL61p2E7lw,i hope he does well at chelsea hes been good for us over the years
2XL61p2E7lw,bad for cityhe was an important player to the team and everyone took him for granted
2XL61p2E7lw,raheem finally at chelsea lets pray hes good for us unlike the other strikers which i shall not  mention
2XL61p2E7lw,im a total man city fan all i can say is thank you chelsea
2XL61p2E7lw,good luck sterling thanks for the years you gave us brilliant player on your day
2XL61p2E7lw,and still so young at 27 we hope to see him join us at the ripe age of 32
2XL61p2E7lw,chelsea will start getting a lot more free kicks and penalties when he plays if you know what i mean
2XL61p2E7lw,when pep starts leaving a player out   you can bet they will be transferred at the end of the season
2XL61p2E7lw,raheem the dream
2XL61p2E7lw,good luck raheem you have been a great servant at city love you and bless you
2XL61p2E7lw,welcome to chelsea raheem
2XL61p2E7lw,why is no one talking about the awful bit of business grealish in for 100 sterling out for 50 twice the player grealish is
2XL61p2E7lw,what a signing big changes at chelsea
2XL61p2E7lw,you all hated on him for years now hes mint hes left city
2XL61p2E7lw,if chelsea can sign harry kane or lewandowski will be a good transfer window for them and can challenge man city
2XL61p2E7lw,mancity has become a talent factory without people noticing then have made a lot of small scale sales and big scale like this in just one month of  transfer window
2XL61p2E7lw,a relief for himhope hes not loaned next season like lukaku
2XL61p2E7lw,man city pulling a fast one with that fee hahaha pep looks like hes having a mental breakdown every time sterlings touched the ball the past couple seasons
2XL61p2E7lw,good clearance by man city he is a 310 in big games
2XL61p2E7lw,does tuchel really want sterling or the new owners
2XL61p2E7lw,welcome to the best team in the world sterling
2XL61p2E7lw,that seems like a really decent price in the current market
2XL61p2E7lw,thanks for everything
2XL61p2E7lw,at this rate hell be playing for man u in 4 years
2XL61p2E7lw,if chelsea would just sign declan rice that be great
2XL61p2E7lw,happy for sterling as a chelsea fan
2XL61p2E7lw,hes a great player
2XL61p2E7lw,great signing love it man city really let sterling go cant wrap my mind about it
2XL61p2E7lw,magical  raheem
2XL61p2E7lw,there would be lots of big chance misses in chelsea lol
2XL61p2E7lw,still feel as a blue we will regret letting him go especially without a replacement
2XL61p2E7lw,so are they replacing werner with another pacy player with good movement and shocking finishing
2XL61p2E7lw,hope sterling gets the fan recognition at chelsea at least man was a wonderful player for city but they never gave him the support
2XL61p2E7lw,i cant stand sterling as being a liverpool fan but i must admit that price tag is very cheap even tho i hate him he is a talented player
2XL61p2E7lw,according to these pundits barcelona cant sign raphinha since dembele renewed his contract huh what i am hearing this morning from elland road is the complete opposite
2XL61p2E7lw,this will probably be sterlings biggest test in his career so far
2XL61p2E7lw,good business from city
2XL61p2E7lw,this is gotta be longest transfer ive ever seen everyday i hear something new is agreed with sterling but still no official announcement
2XL61p2E7lw,475m even as a united fan i say chelski have over spent
2XL61p2E7lw,all the best sterling city legend now gnabry in please
2XL61p2E7lw,i think instead of selling sterling for 47 million they would have been swap sterling with reece james which was their target
2XL61p2E7lw,hes never settled anywhere never been the main man either desperate signing from chelsea imo
2XL61p2E7lw,this has been drawn out for days why not just wait until hes actually signed instead of rehashing it over and over
2XL61p2E7lw,hopefully get more game time in prep for world cup
2XL61p2E7lw,riyad mahrez the hero
2XL61p2E7lw,do you remember those chelsea fans who were caught on camera verbally abusing raheem with racial slurs
2XL61p2E7lw,sad to see him go he seems to play hes best football at city
2XL61p2E7lw,chelsea craving a last minute equalisersterling misses a sitter
2XL61p2E7lw,as a neutral looking forward to seeing him in the prem  oh wait nvm
2XL61p2E7lw,idk about that leadership part since his head hadnt arrived with him in those big games where he missed so many sitters
2XL61p2E7lw,raheem sterling has now played for three of the five biggest clubs in the premier league
2XL61p2E7lw,i thought he went to city to win the champions league  must be trying his luck at chelsea now then
2XL61p2E7lw,theres been nothing quick about this damn deal
2XL61p2E7lw,cant wait to see how he does
2XL61p2E7lw,hes signed like 1000 times been hearing this for 7 days now lmao
2XL61p2E7lw,great signing
2XL61p2E7lw,swapped sterling and jesus for haaland great moves
2XL61p2E7lw,what a signing
2XL61p2E7lw,must be rare to play for liverpool  man city and now chelsea and then onto the arsenal from chelsea
2XL61p2E7lw,welcome to the bridge raheem sterling
2XL61p2E7lw,i feel like this are not needed signings for chelsea 2 of their best defenders have signed in spain and they go and buy sterling and now want another attacker
2XL61p2E7lw,picture of sterling grabbing corey done him dirty sky
2XL61p2E7lw,i love mark mcadam as after this appearance on sky he was straight off for an evening of ballroom dancing
2XL61p2E7lw,class player man
2XL61p2E7lw,how long has this been going on now think chelsea have forgotten we have bigger problems with having barely any defenders
2XL61p2E7lw,werner and sterling chelsea hates goals
2XL61p2E7lw,they been saying on the verge for a couple of weeks now
2XL61p2E7lw,lukaku and sterling would be a crazy duo  a man u fan
2XL61p2E7lw,who is waiting for the breaking news sterling signs for chelsea
2XL61p2E7lw,well i guess hes in the perfect places to take his immense diving whining and missing sitter talent to
2XL61p2E7lw,united fan but great buy by chelsea big fan of sterling wish you the best king
2XL61p2E7lw,sterling was class for city why they get rid of him he was class for pool as well he would of been better going to united
2XL61p2E7lw,sterling is just not efficient in front of the goal at least in the premiere league  as a chelsea fan im not that thrilled for this signing personally
2XL61p2E7lw,many english players seem overvalued and overrated  just look at how they played against hungary
